challenges and opportunity

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,760
from a 2016 study reported by reuters to

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,920
the post-pandemic world with new risks

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,160
and opportunities to every sector

27
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
women's role in leadership has remained

28
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,719
in the center of gender equality debates

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,960
not just in i.t but also across many

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,400
industries

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,040
in 2016 the conclusion of a study

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
conducted of 22 000 publicly traded

33
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,720
companies across 91 countries by the

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,640
peterson institute for international

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,960
economics revealed that ones with women

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,960
in leadership roles had reported six

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,720
percent higher profit

38
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,920
while this could be attributed to

39
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
several factors one cannot underestimate

40
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,960
the unique values those determined and

41
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,320
hardworking leaders brought to their

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
industries

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,079
fast forward to 2022 as the world

44
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,479

45
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,320
related restrictions

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,320
opportunities such as working remotely

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,000
are further expected to pave the way for

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,840
a higher percentage of women to enter

49
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680

it's a little more informal come on come

113
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
on closer

114
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
yeah but just not yeah but the premium

115
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,080
is going to belong to you that might not

116
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
work

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,200
we'll do that

118
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,200
it works can we see everybody

119
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,000
yeah

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,680
all right you all see everyone

121
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,200
all right

122
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,159
all right so we're going to start with

123
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,120
one of nikki's recordings um

124
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
and i believe i asked her the question

125
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
in the recording so i will let you guys

126
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,040
play the first nikki recording

127
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,439
so nikki um i would love to ask you why

128
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,519
do we need more women in executive i.t

129
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,400
leadership

130
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,478
why does gender balancing even matter

131
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,720
yeah i mean i think simply put women

132
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,279
bring a fresh perspective as

133
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
as do people from many different

134
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,199
backgrounds so if you have diverse

135
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,600
experiences within a team or within a

136
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,800
leadership team you're going to have

137
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
people who are constantly bringing

138
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,680
different viewpoints and that

139
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
tends to foster innovation so

140
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,360
um certainly what tends to be most

141
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
important for companies is that

142
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,880
studies have shown that companies with

143
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,800
greater gender diversity

144
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
not only within their workforce but also

145
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,040
within their leadership teams are

146
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
significantly more profitable than those

147
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,800
without gender diversity so i think

148
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
that's certainly important

149
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
um i think you know additionally there's

150
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
studies that show that women are more

151
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,400
effective leaders they're more

152
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,840
empathetic leaders they're better

153
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
communicators but i think one of the

154
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
most important things affecting women

155
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
and women of color is that placing women

156
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
in leadership roles where they can

157
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,039
thrive

158
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,360
can help bridge that gender pay gap that

159
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,520
we hear about and so i think the

160
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,720
challenge is is that um i attended a

161
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,479
leadership conference for women of the

162
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,520
channel in late 2021 and there was a

163
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
study that they talked about where

164
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
the pay gap actually increased as women

165
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
moved up in the workplace so for example

166
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
and my numbers could be a little bit off

167
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
but if you were an executive in tech as

168
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,560
a woman the pay gap from when you were a

169
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
first line manager to an executive went

170
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,280
from 72 cents on the dollar to 64 cents

171
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
on the dollar so i think a an additional

172
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
challenge that we face is keeping women

173
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
interested in executive leadership roles

174
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,280
because why would we want to continue to

175
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,440
move up the corporate ladder if our pay

176
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,240
gap is actually going to increase

177
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,320
so i mean certainly i think it makes

178
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,360
companies more profitable i think women

179
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,600
show many skills that make them

180
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,039
effective leaders

181
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,400
but also i think if we want to do

182
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
anything about this gender pay gap then

183
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,440
we need women in those roles because

184
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,639
those are the people that are actually

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,440
going to affect change

186
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,680
thank you nikki

187
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,960
this next question i'm going to direct

188
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,240
to you johnny

189
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,840
what skills do you believe women are

190
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,240
uniquely experienced that benefit the

191
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,039
workplace

192
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,479
women uniquely skilled right um

193
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,400
let's see so i guess we're talking about

194
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,319
women leaders in particular and i think

195
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,360
um

196
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,800
uh

197
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,440
and hopefully

198
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,199
the rest of the panel agrees

199
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,080
women have definitely a natural affinity

200
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,400
toward negotiation i think and toward

201
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,720
finding common ground and that is

202
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,840
definitely

203
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,000
uh particularly in

204
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,919
tech leadership roles and engineering

205
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,160
roles where we want to be innovative we

206
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
want to foster ideas uh but at the same

207
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,360
time we want to converge on sort of the

208
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,919
the most efficient or the minimum viable

209
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,639
um i i often find in in a group uh that

210
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,800
uh that women leaders will steer the

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,599
conversation toward um

212
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,759
a a resolution or a path forward that uh

213
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,919
that folks can agree

214
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,479
look it's i mean these skill sets when

215
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,560
we talk about a particular gender having

216
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
them versus another they're they're not

217
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,479
unique to a gender necessarily but it's

218
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,720
more uh about

219
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,599
you know

220
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,400
do we um encounter it more often i would

221
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
say um i don't know if you have anything

222
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,639
to add jezebel i

223
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,199
so i started paca fabric because i

224
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,360
believe in collaboration and i think

225
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
that's a nature to most women and

226
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,120
not to say that men are not into

227
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
collaboration

228
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,639
but i think many uh men are raised to be

229
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,360
individual to to compete against each

230
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,120
other and women

231
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,680
tend to collaborate more and in

232
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,840
leadership culture in women in

233
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,599
leadership position positions also um

234
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,400
promotes collaboration more

235
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,440
in my personal opinion than

236
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,639
men

237
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,639
and i find that a lot of male allies uh

238
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,720
in the room will also follow suit so

239
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
there's a kind of a mutual learning that

240
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,039
happens as a result of that and

241
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,400
and then if you have a different take or

242
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,759
an idea i i would agree i think that um

243
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,879
one of the

244
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,800
real attributes that women bring to the

245
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
table is empathy

246
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,960
and sort of the inclusive nature of we

247
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,760
are we tend to be sort of

248
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,320
natural consensus builders and so we

249
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,159
want to make sure that every voice is

250
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,519
heard and we want to make sure that

251
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,000
everybody's contributing and i think

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
that's a strength and something that

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,360
helps to

254
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,880
get you to the point where you have

255
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,880
moved forward and progressed whether

256
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,480
that's a project or an initiative

257
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,320
and from an employment data perspective

258
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,440
i think that empathy uh plays out in in

259
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,360
retention morale right uh so

260
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,560
when we start talking about these

261
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,240
payoffs and and having a diverse

262
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,839
workforce not just gender neurodiverse

263
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,800
um

264
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,839
you know the we we want folks to stay

265
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,399
and to thrive and a lot of the the

266
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
emotional health and feeling heard uh i

267
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,519
i think contributes to that so there you

268
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,320
go

269
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,519
thank you it was great um jezebel i'll

270
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,360
direct to the next question to you

271
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,959
let's discuss the challenges faced by

272
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
women to enter the it world of it

273
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,560
leadership

274
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,800
what is the hesitation and how did you

275
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,760
personally enter the leadership space

276
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,519
i think there's a lot of different types

277
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,360
of challenges

278
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,640
first of all

279
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
they're just not that many positions

280
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
in the leadership

281
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,720
roles and second of all i think women

282
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,720
are generally more critical of our own

283
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
qualifications not skills or abilities

284
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
but our own qualifications i think i

285
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,880
read to statistics what that said that

286
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,560
women who

287
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,480
reads a job description

288
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,360
that

289
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,600
see that they meet 90 percent of the

290
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,000
dropped description and think that they

291
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
are not qualified because they don't

292
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,360
meet the

293
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,279
10 percent but

294
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,320
men reads the job description and when

295
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,440
they only meet 60 percent they apply

296
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
so um i think that there's

297
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,120
additional um

298
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,200
internal

299
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,360
drive that needs to say you know i am

300
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
willing to step up

301
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,040
to become a leader

302
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,320
and

303
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,480
to be in a leadership position in my

304
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,240
personal experience

305
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,880
it's not about somebody putting you in

306
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
the position it's about you

307
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
stepping up and willing to make the

308
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,640
commitment and take the responsibility

309
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,040
because you're not just responsible for

310
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,079
a project or yourself you're responsible

311
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,079
for all the people that are going to be

312
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,440
working with you and for you and so

313
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,519
whether that's you know your employees

314
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,279
that's your customers you're going to be

315
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,600
responsible for a lot so

316
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,240
are you personally willing to take that

317
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,959
responsibility and say yes i'm going to

318
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
do that no matter how hard and whatever

319
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
it takes so

320
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,959
you asked me how i got started and

321
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,040
i actually got started in this community

322
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,160
as a volunteer in nanog

323
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,640
and betty who was our executive director

324
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,880
had asked me to join the communications

325
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,920
committee

326
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,680
and

327
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,399
i

328
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,800
i said yeah i love the community and let

329
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
me come in and help

330
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,800
i have she

331
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,120
supported me she mentored me without me

332
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,640
knowing that i was actually being

333
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,560
mentored and i participated

334
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,120
in the board meetings as

335
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,639
the chair of the communications

336
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,120
committee so i learned

337
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,839
the thought process of leaders you know

338
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,200
what do they think

339
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,560
why do they think

340
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,040
certain ways and then

341
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,279
and i felt you know if they can do that

342
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,639
why can't i

343
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,360
right

344
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,200
i wouldn't riff on that a little bit too

345
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,079
because

346
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,600
you know obviously we have a lot of men

347
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
in the audience as well and many of you

348
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,000
are probably managers leaders

349
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,880
um

350
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,720
so you may or may not know that women

351
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,320
tend to be quite self-critical when it

352
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,160
comes to reading resume qualifications

353
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,760
or feeling like they're ready to step up

354
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,519
for that management position

355
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,680
and being aware of that

356
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,320
can actually help you

357
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,200
bring some of your very qualified

358
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,839
would-be managers up and we just had a

359
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,680
recent experience here one of my

360
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,000
phenomenal managers cam mcgahan is here

361
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
and a long time nanak speaker and member

362
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,920
um and he knows very well that we

363
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,160
we had a couple of candidates that we

364
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,720
promoted women to managers but one in

365
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,920
particular

366
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,399
uh when when we asked her whether she

367
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,200
was ready the all the self-criticality

368
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,720
came out why not and i'm this many

369
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,000
months away and i feel like it should

370
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,120
have this

371
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
certification

372
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,839
that training

373
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:08,800
um

374
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
bottom line was that uh

375
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,040
yes she may have been a couple months

376
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,240
off from the certification the

377
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,560
qualifications needed but

378
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,279
the manager said i'm going to help you

379
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,760
i'm going to help you step into that you

380
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,079
are ready trust me we're in it together

381
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,320
so so this is sort of a a little bit of

382
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,399
a teachable moment uh here for our

383
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,839
audience and and um i hope uh

384
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,360
some folks are walking out so maybe not

385
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
so teachable um

386
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,440
sorry i was told this is a really frank

387
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,160
group right so and then you you all have

388
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
a terrific sense of humor

389
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,600
any anyway um i don't know if uh debbie

390
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
absolutely so

391
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,639
jezebel yes your point about when you

392
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,959
get the position you must assume the

393
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,160
position

394
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,839
it's really about you know confidence

395
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,240
versus competence and i think that a lot

396
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
of times with women

397
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,279
we might be hesitant to be real up front

398
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,240
or real aggressive about a point of view

399
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,959
or our knowledge or um just our

400
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,040
day-to-day interactions

401
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,079
and i think that i'll you know

402
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,240
conversely you said a little bit about

403
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:24,959
the

404
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,639
idea of women having imposter syndrome

405
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
in some cases i think we talked about

406
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,000
that yes um the idea that

407
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,560
it's in a lot of ways

408
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,480
when people aren't expected to be seen

409
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,120
in certain places or spaces they often

410
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,800
feel like they don't belong in those

411
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,720
places and spaces and that they must

412
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,680
prove that they do belong and i feel

413
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
strongly that

414
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,800
with anything whether you're a woman or

415
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,399
a man or a

416
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,639
fish or a dog or whatever you are you

417
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,880
you lead with your competence

418
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,160
that's what you're there for you're

419
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,839
there to do the job i think that if you

420
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,600
lead with competence

421
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,079
you'll gain the confidence that will

422
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,880
help you thrive and maintain your place

423
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,120
there and one of the things that builds

424
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,920
confidence and that's for anybody right

425
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,959
is data right know your stuff and have

426
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,279
the facts on your side can never go

427
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,920
wrong with presenting data and facts

428
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,320
and i just want to add on the confidence

429
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,040
piece confidence is built

430
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,680
by failing and then trying again and

431
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,959
succeeding

432
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,079
so if you fail the first time

433
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,320
don't let it get you down do it again

434
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,639
and succeed at it learn from your

435
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,800
mistakes and that's how you build

436
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,120
confidence and that goes to you women

437
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,560
and men so

438
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,519
um

439
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,040
yeah at least

440
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,519
and and i think too that you often you

441
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,360
know you have to think about the whole

442
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,199
legion of managers you've ever worked

443
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,759
for you want to be the leader you want

444
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,120
to work for

445
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,839
you want to be the person that is not

446
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,079
only just empathetic but also has an

447
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,759
interest in your career

448
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,040
that is

449
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,560
interested in developing people but also

450
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,240
you know when we're speaking about the

451
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,560
idea of this you know

452
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,399
collective or diverse group of people we

453
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,360
are talking about diversity of ideas a

454
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,839
diversity of understanding diversity of

455
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:20,880
talent

456
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,320

457
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,399

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,679
performance

510
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,160
absolutely that reminds me of um a

511
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
comment a colleague said

512
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,160
um to me about a couple weeks ago we

513
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,919
were talking about the

514
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:22,640
the

515
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,039
evolution of linkedin

516
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,520
and all of the accomplishments and all

517
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
of the

518
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,440
um

519
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,160
what this person termed self-promotion

520
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,320
and i thought uh this is this is

521
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,360
interesting so one of the

522
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,320
key

523
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,400
points or key takeaways was around this

524
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
idea of people starting out discussing

525
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,000
whatever it is that they've accomplished

526
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,120
and saying

527
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,400
i'm humbled to tell you i'm humbled to

528
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,000
share with you that i'm

529
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,520
running the world now you know

530
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,400
and and

531
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,000
i think that one of the things that we

532
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,400
have to remember is that not just to be

533
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,799
humble but to actually be humble

534
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,799
and remember what it was like for you in

535
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,640
the beginning of your career and people

536
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
i know i work with a lot of folks that

537
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,320
are young people that are coming up that

538
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,640
are sort of trying to navigate corporate

539
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,200
life trying to navigate an industry an

540
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
industry that and i'm in cyber security

541
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
people never like to say

542
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,280
that they don't know the answer

543
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,320
and that

544
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,640
is a challenge in and of itself right

545
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,360
but

546
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,600
that humbleness and the willingness to

547
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,080
sort of step back and you know know what

548
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,360
you don't know

549
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,559
um

550
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,440
hire and promote and um encourage the

551
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,480
people that

552
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,120
do know it or that have the skills that

553
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,480
are required

554
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,640
um make sure that you are again like

555
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,559
putting those people up front

556
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,400
i see instances sometimes where there

557
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,360
are managers that have folks that are

558
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,480
really strong contributors ask yourself

559
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,520
as a leader are you going to the next

560
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,320
management meeting promoting that person

561
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,640
promoting that person's idea or are you

562
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,080
taking on that set of ideas as your own

563
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,679
and that's something that happens a lot

564
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,840
in our industry we don't appreciate the

565
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,080
deeply technical in the way that we

566
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,760
should a lot of times business is

567
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,400
speaking for the technical folks and

568
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,000
i think that um

569
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,919
you know when it comes right down to it

570
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,159
it is it is about being humble knowing

571
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,240
what you know knowing what you don't

572
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,960
know and being authentic and i think

573
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,880
that those are traits that

574
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,880
all of us share to some extent or

575
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,039
another but we need to be reminded yeah

576
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
certainly certainly we need that in

577
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,960
leaders um

578
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,600
one uh one thing i wanted to you're kind

579
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,360
of spawning all these other thoughts one

580
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,640
thing that we've had a lot of success

581
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,080
with and again this is getting a little

582
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,440
bit away from the gender sort of

583
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,120
specific stuff but

584
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
it used to be at least from for me

585
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,679
admitting to sort of maybe this

586
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,520
fixed mindset for a bit there it used to

587
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
be well how many years have you been

588
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,559
doing this and how many certifications

589
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,720
do you have and that denoted experience

590
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,039
well our younger earlier and career

591
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,360
employees are showing up with um first

592
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,120
of all they're showing up as autodidax

593
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,799
right self-taught

594
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,880
and they are able to um

595
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,280
acquire these technical skills right

596
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,880
learning to code learning to develop

597
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,440
learning cyber um

598
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,679
developing tooling themselves so much

599
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,080
faster than um than what prior

600
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,159
experience had shown me and so we see

601
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,000
that potential there and we're realizing

602
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
that these earlier and career people are

603
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,960
actually

604
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,400
maturing faster and um and have you know

605
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,520
promotion

606
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,039
uh uh uh potential and in fact one

607
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,559
person in particular i'm thinking of

608
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,640
we've had to promote him three times in

609
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,120
a year and a half because he just uh by

610
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,440
virtue of just being self-taught is is

611
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,280
kind of leaping through all the stages

612
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,080
so we should also be open to

613
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,799
sort of this this new world if you will

614
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,440
of of the evolution of employees and uh

615
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,799
and be looking to

616
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,559
to the earlier in career folks for this

617
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,360
very rich development pool

618
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
i want to add a little to that and i

619
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,480
think that's really well said absolutely

620
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,919
but

621
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,520
just to go back to the building

622
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,600
confidence piece

623
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,440
i think as a leader

624
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,159
we are after results all the time we

625
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,360
talk about data and but you have to

626
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
realize that employees and the people

627
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,840
who follow you are humans they are not

628
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,200
perfect and they're going to make

629
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,159
mistakes so in order for them to gain

630
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,159
confidence gain competence gain

631
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,480
additional skill set and learn on the

632
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,240
job on the fly

633
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,320
you have to give them room to make

634
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,679
mistakes

635
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,520
and so i i was recently

636
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,919
in a situation where i got i learned

637
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
this phrase um it's

638
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,840
d-u-i-f and it was you know delivered to

639
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,200
me and if you don't know what it means

640
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
you can probably look it up

641
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,640
on google and

642
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
so when i

643
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,360
heard that said to the group of people i

644
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,919
was shocked because

645
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,360
the culture that we want to promote to

646
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,159
everyone that we work with is

647
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,640
be creative

648
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,360
drive yourself be motivated and find the

649
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,440
solution that you need to find whether

650
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,840
it's inside the box or outside the box

651
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,240
right and um if you're telling somebody

652
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
you know if you mess up you're going to

653
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,320
lose your job then nobody's going to go

654
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,400
out of their way to do the best that

655
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
they can they're going to try to do what

656
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,200
they must so they don't lose their job

657
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,360
and so as a leader you should never do

658
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,320
that and so as leaders especially as

659
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,360
women female leaders and

660
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,000
i want to encourage everybody

661
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,559
to do something to do to give your best

662
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,480
even if it isn't

663
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,840
the right thing

664
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,640
for that particular project

665
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,039
incident and so that

666
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,400
you can

667
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,320
grow as an individual because that's

668
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,120
what leaders are supposed to do to help

669
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,480
the people around you grow

670
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,799
it should never be punitive for sure and

671
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,080
in fact a lot of times and i think you

672
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,000
you've all had this experience where you

673
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,400
even step in front to give some

674
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,919
protection to that manager or that

675
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,840
individual that may have tried

676
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,720
aired and needs that second chance and

677
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,320
and so you fall on your sword in front

678
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,559
of the customer or the or the boss or

679
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,320
whatever it is and say hey you know we

680
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
were innovating here uh we broke some

681
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,399
eggs uh we'll fix it

682
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,400
those are all really great responses i

683
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
resonated with a lot of what all of you

684
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,760
said um i feel like i'm going through a

685
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,279
similar experience right now with the

686
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,039
nano board since that's program

687
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,559
committee chair i get to sit on the

688
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,720
board as a non-voting member and i

689
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,080
really think it's such an amazing

690
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,320
opportunity to get mentorship experience

691
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
from all of these more seasoned

692
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,120
engineers and leaders in our community

693
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,640
because it is a confidence issue if

694
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,840
you'd asked me a couple years ago would

695
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,600
i ever consider running for the board i

696
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,360
would have told you i'm not qualified

697
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,960
there's no way and now i've got a

698
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,559
totally different perspective

699
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,720
about what that means to actually be on

700
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,400
a board i've never sat on any board

701
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
before you know and then you were

702
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,360
talking about imposter syndrome as well

703
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,559
which i just want to mention for those

704
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,919
of you coming and joining us at lunch

705
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,240
after this uh manju from aws is actually

706
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,679
going to do a little presentation about

707
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:19,919
imposter syndrome which i think is not

708
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,440
unique to females we may deal with

709
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,279
slightly more but i definitely have male

710
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,640
colleagues that have told me they've

711
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,919
dealt with imposter syndrome where you

712
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,600
just don't feel like you actually know

713
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,039
the things you know

714
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,000
and feel like you're always proving

715
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,919
yourselves uh so our next question i'm

716
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,840
going to direct to you debbie

717
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,960
let's talk about the challenges

718
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
encountered by the female leaders to

719
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
succeed so not enter now to succeed in

720
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,600
their positions

721
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,039
which we talked a little bit about but

722
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,240
what are some of those changes that

723
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,400
individuals and organizations can make

724
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,320
to allow women to enter their leadership

725
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
i mean some i covered this already but

726
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
what else can we do to help

727
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,000
promote and grow

728
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,039
our women into those leadership

729
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,760
positions i think that you know i think

730
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
one thing that's always really powerful

731
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,600
is if you want to ascend to a leadership

732
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,760
position or if you are a leader who

733
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,000
wants to you know develop a pipeline of

734
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,480
folks that you think are uniquely suited

735
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
for certain roles

736
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,720
that shadowing people is extremely

737
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,640
important i think it's really important

738
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
like you said you were on the board

739
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,480
then you realized like

740
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,720
i'm on this board i i'm right where i

741
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,799
need to be right yeah but that's that

742
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,159
experience of really sort of

743
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,919
understanding what's happening in the

744
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,520
hallowed halls

745
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
of leadership

746
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,080
and i think that you know

747
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,400
in a lot of ways

748
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,360
we all sort of thrive in these types of

749
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,640
environment

750
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,600
where

751
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,480
we're solving tough problems and but

752
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,760
we're also

753
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,880
many of us

754
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,039
somewhat introverted i would say i think

755
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,120
that that's kind of like a trait in in

756
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
tech that i would

757
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
i think most people would probably agree

758
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,480
that we're not

759
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,559
beating our chest necessarily over the

760
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,320
first thing or the last thing that we've

761
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,440
accomplished

762
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,520
and i think that for women it's even

763
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,480
more so i think that we have a tendency

764
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,279
to

765
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,080
hide our light under a bushel so to

766
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,679
speak and also

767
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,400
to

768
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,080
um

769
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
not to feel like it's not a positive

770
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,679
trait

771
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,720
to um talk about what we've accomplished

772
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,039
necessarily or you know the projects

773
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,279
that we're working on we're very team

774
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,960
oriented and i feel that with

775
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,440
organizations and with developing

776
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,039
women leaders

777
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,279
that it's not that an organization has

778
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,360
to go do something totally different

779
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
than what

780
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,760
men would do or what they would do for

781
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,919
men male leaders i think that for

782
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,039
everybody

783
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,799
that's in the room the real take-home

784
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,000
message is imagine that new manager or

785
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,279
that new

786
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,840
executive that's female that comes to

787
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,000
join the team imagine that she's your

788
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,120
sister

789
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,399
or your mother or your aunt or

790
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,760
your friend

791
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,520
and think of how

792
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,919
you'd want to treat her if you want to

793
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,520
include her in

794
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,320
all of the conversations both formal and

795
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
the informal ones think of how you'd

796
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,360
want people to treat her in her own

797
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,679
setting and i think it's just again i

798
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,360
hate to keep using the word empathy but

799
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,000
it is sort of down to that it really is

800
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,320
and because i don't know that there is a

801
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,880
a particular systematic formula that

802
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,360
corporations need to put in place but i

803
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,600
think we as individuals just start

804
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,919
thinking that way

805
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,000
i think it goes a long way i i would add

806
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,440
to that i i i liked your point about

807
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,760
you know we tend to sort of hide our our

808
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,520
light a little bit it's not just women i

809
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,159
think i think all of us find ourselves

810
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,799
in conversations with our senior manager

811
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,159
and there's an opportunity and you want

812
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,240
something uh you want to do something

813
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,440
there you want to increase the scope of

814
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,720
your team you want to get additional

815
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,320
investment you want to make the case for

816
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,039
those resources for that project

817
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,159
and yet you're not telling the story of

818
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,440
what it is that you've accomplished yet

819
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,120
that make you worthy of that because we

820
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,520
think well that's a

821
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,159
self-aggrandizement

822
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,240
the thing to remember is that if you're

823
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,399
talking to a vp svp

824
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,720
they're busy they probably barely know

825
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,640
you let alone the scope of your work

826
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,200
you're giving information that is key to

827
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,039
making that decision and then investment

828
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,720
in you it is not

829
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,279
a billboard to yourself it is investment

830
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,360
that becomes extremely important to

831
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
deliver

832
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,960
so that you can accomplish some of the

833
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,880
things that you need to for uh for

834
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,480
yourself and for your team

835
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,559
that benefit the company so there is

836
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,360
that

837
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,480
as well

838
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,200
i

839
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,919
absolutely second that as an executive

840
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,720
you can't know everyone

841
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,200
all the time in every detail so what

842
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,399
you're getting um as johnny said is the

843
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,200
detail the information the data so

844
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
you're not promoting yourself you're not

845
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,919
highlighting your you know

846
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,399
qualities that you want to promote

847
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,279
you're giving data so that the company

848
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,320
that leader can make a better decision

849
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,640
based on the data that you're providing

850
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,360
so

851
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
um

852
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,799
do it

853
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:15,520
be truthful and be honest be authentic

854
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,960
as debbie says

855
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,000
and

856
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,600
it benefits you

857
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,320
and

858
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,360
the company right like yeah i was going

859
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,200
to say and if you're introverted and the

860
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
conversation doesn't feel natural it's

861
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,039
not a natural thing

862
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,919
um

863
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,559
right that famous two pager that aws has

864
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,919
made famous

865
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,080
literally send it ahead and say you know

866
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,000
i want the 10 minutes to just talk about

867
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,840
the contents they're in

868
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,000
absolutely and the short and crisp and

869
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,559
clean always works three bullet points

870
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,960
really i think about how

871
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,360
there's a big debate going on around

872
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,840
chief information security officers

873
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,480
and being really having a place at the

874
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,720
table at board meetings and really being

875
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,039
able to feel that they can be honest

876
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,399
about

877
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:01,519
the threat

878
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,919
its impact to business and i would

879
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,480
encourage everyone to sort of understand

880
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,799
how the business is motivated and having

881
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:12,080
those conversations so that you are um a

882
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,399
good translator and so that you don't

883
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,720
come in you're coming in hot at this

884
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,720
level and nobody in the board

885
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,039
understands anything that you're talking

886
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,519
about but putting it you know like my

887
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,440
grandmother used to say where the goats

888
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
can get it where people where everybody

889
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,919
can sort of understand

890
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,120
understand what it is that you're

891
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,720
talking about and so that's a that's a

892
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,600
that's a switch in language that is a

893
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,360
switch in emphasis

894
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,919
it's finding what are the crown jewels

895
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:43,600
and the things that the people you're

896
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,519
addressing really care about and

897
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,080
translating your own language to one

898
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,880
that they can understand and one that

899
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,840
resonates with them and that and and

900
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,919
that's a really important that's very

901
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,519
important for going anywhere in your

902
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,919
career actually but particularly are we

903
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,640
all security at least the

904
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,720
definitely securities infrastructure

905
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,120
infrastructure security

906
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,720
and infrastructure

907
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,000
i see yeah cam

908
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,600
he helped bring us together i think

909
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,760
though

910
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,840
but i was going to say especially with

911
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,880
topics as serious as security where uh

912
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,240
you know uh company data fines

913
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,159
regulations loss of businesses on the

914
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:26,960
line

915
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,000
um communicating clearly to people that

916
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,880
are all under duress uh especially when

917
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,960
uh industry events happen is is

918
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,200
important which means um

919
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,279
you know uh putting aside some of the

920
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,720
technical and translating for folks

921
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,360
i do think that um

922
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,760
this is relevant to the diversity

923
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,919
discussion as well though in that a lot

924
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,399
of times

925
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,039
csos are predominantly male and we do

926
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,360
have female leaders trying to make the

927
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,600
case for uh what decisions need to be

928
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,399
made again under duress um

929
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,080
so

930
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,640
you know i i guess the the

931
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,159
faster we can get to the point i have

932
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,919
this challenge sometimes i take a while

933
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,720
meander to my point the the the most

934
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,240
most succinctly we can make the point

935
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,960
the best and and that comes to you know

936
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,519
uh also communicating accomplishments

937
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,039
great i'm actually gonna have us jump

938
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,279
back over to nikki um so we have another

939
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,519
question pre-recorded from her

940
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,960
so would you cue that up

941
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,519
nikki are the challenges different from

942
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,919
the ones faced by your male counterparts

943
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,159
sure i mean i think uh the the most

944
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,559
obvious is that we're typically

945
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,840
one of the only women in the room um

946
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,440
and most of the

947
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,080
most the people in the room are men so

948
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,679
i think this

949
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,919
can

950
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,840
create a situation where we feel left

951
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,360
out or we feel like we're not a part of

952
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,120
the boys club and so you have one of two

953
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,279
things happen you either desperately

954
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,519
desperately try to be a part of the boys

955
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,399
club

956
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,120
or you feel left out and so i think

957
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,600
there is a positive to this scenario

958
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,440
where it really creates an opportunity

959
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,760
for women to stand out create that long

960
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,159
lasting impression from the beginning um

961
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
unfortunately i think this tends to lead

962
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,760
to you know women

963
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,679
who are typically doing more than their

964
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,918
fair share of their workload at home

965
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,639
um are are also picking more than

966
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,000
picking up more than their fair share of

967
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,399
the workload at work and so this creates

968
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,760
a potential for burnout um i think that

969
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,119
you know women can be perceived as being

970
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,520
more emotional however i think if you

971
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,399
flip the script on that i think that um

972
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,639
emotional maturity that mental kind of

973
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,800
experience of you know what women go

974
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,359
through how we balance work work and

975
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:48,560
home

976
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,239
can really bring

977
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,719
um different experiences to the everyday

978
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,960
conversation that we're having with um

979
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,239
with our teams

980
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,760
and then i think

981
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,920
you know if we think about

982
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,839
how different it is from the male

983
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,760
experience i think

984
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,880
where we tend to fall short as as as

985
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,119
human beings is that we all need to be a

986
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,200
part of this conversation i think men

987
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,800
need to be a part of this conversation

988
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,640
they need to be part of the solution

989
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,640
when it comes to hiring women retaining

990
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,520
women which is huge and promoting women

991
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,160
um i see it all too often um having

992
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,079
worked with with

993
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,040
you know mostly men my entire uh career

994
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,240
is that men don't want to have this

995
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,839
conversation because it's uncomfortable

996
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:31,920
they don't want to offend anyone i think

997
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,599
they want to help i think the majority

998
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,760
of people want to help this problem but

999
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,640
i think

1000
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,760
um

1001
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,599
you know we have to work on this

1002
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,200
together and i think it has to be raised

1003
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,960
by people who have the agency to

1004
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,560
actually affect change within an

1005
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,880
organization if we don't work together

1006
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,040
it's going to be you know at this rate i

1007
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,520
think 180 years before we have parity

1008
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,480
between male and female um leaders and

1009
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,960
obviously that's that's too long

1010
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,599
so anything any of you want to add on

1011
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,960
that before we go to our next question

1012
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,520
um i was thinking as nikki was speaking

1013
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,359
as far as you know walking into a room

1014
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,320
and really being the only one of you um

1015
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,480
i was thinking in the reverse too which

1016
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,480
is more to i guess the the the women in

1017
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,920
the room um uh we too have i think some

1018
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,359
some bias that we need to check

1019
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,560
ourselves on so i i remember i used to

1020
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,280
travel a lot speak in all over the world

1021
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,359
and um quite a few times in places like

1022
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,800
abu dhabi and dubai where um on matters

1023
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,560
of security where

1024
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,960
literally i i think i would be probably

1025
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,119
the only woman in for miles in in in

1026
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,200
these large conference centers and so my

1027
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,480
assumption was always that i was not

1028
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,640
being taken seriously particularly maybe

1029
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,760
in that part of the world where it was

1030
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,520
just so starkly male

1031
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,119
um and and

1032
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,280
it felt culturally distant to me

1033
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,320
um and i remember in one presentation i

1034
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,960
finished and um there was like literally

1035
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,079
a queue

1036
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,000
of these gentlemen in the dish dashes to

1037
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,400
to to speak with me as a follow-on and i

1038
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,520
thought

1039
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,040
okay

1040
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,839
we all have a certain amount of biases

1041
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,040
and we

1042
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,720
that doesn't mean that we

1043
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,119
discard them they serve us a purpose but

1044
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,680
we also need to park them to allow for

1045
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,280
the opportunities that are in front of

1046
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,760
us to to surface uh come to light and

1047
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,880
for us to take advantage of them so

1048
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,119
i i love what about what you just said

1049
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,000
because the bias isn't just towards

1050
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,960
others

1051
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,160
right the bias is towards yourself often

1052
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,280
and but that you know so check that

1053
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,880
always check on your unconscious biases

1054
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,839
because um i think at one of the women

1055
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,160
in tech lunch in the past i've spoken

1056
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,359
about unconscious bias and we all have

1057
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,160
them if you think that you don't

1058
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,079
you you need to check again and need to

1059
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,960
check often yeah

1060
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,520
because sometimes

1061
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,160
you know i often think hotel food is

1062
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,560
terrible

1063
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,880
and you know and we go to a lot of

1064
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,400
conferences and you have to eat hotel

1065
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,560
food and you know sometimes i'm

1066
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,480
surprised i was like oh that was really

1067
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
good and so

1068
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,560
be open-minded and that's actually a

1069
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,560
quality in leader

1070
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,880
in leadership that you really need to

1071
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,400
have be open-minded and as johnny said

1072
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,640
that that bias does serve a purpose

1073
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,680
right

1074
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,520
it's nature and but help yourself

1075
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,760
recognize that you have that unconscious

1076
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,400
bias and it makes you a better leader a

1077
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,359
better human being and you know

1078
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,599
it opens up a whole new world to you

1079
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,320
that you otherwise wouldn't know yeah

1080
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,079
and i would go further and say that

1081
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,880
sometimes the unconscious bias is

1082
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,320
women

1083
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,160
toward women

1084
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,920
i would say at least my own experience

1085
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,680
in my career i've been helped more by

1086
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,200
men than any

1087
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,800
other group

1088
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,040
and i would say that people that

1089
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,720
recognize your talent

1090
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,200
and they are willing to mentor or are

1091
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,599
willing to include you or willing to

1092
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,520
support what you're doing

1093
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,200
those are people

1094
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,200
that are sometimes stepping out there a

1095
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,560
bit from their peers to to do that and

1096
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,960
it's appreciated but i would say that a

1097
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,400
lot of times we don't always support

1098
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,480
each other in the way that would be

1099
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,560
both necessary and helpful so instead of

1100
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,359
thinking of your role particularly as

1101
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,720
you had mentioned

1102
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,960
earlier nikki about how there's so few

1103
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,280
roles at the top so to speak

1104
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,359
and that you know there's this sense of

1105
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,839
scarcity that oh if this person gets

1106
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:48,720
promoted then i get i don't miss my spot

1107
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,320
there and so on so on you know like

1108
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,960
people sort of plotting out their future

1109
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,839
path

1110
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,320
and so with this scarcity when women

1111
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,960
show up in spaces where there's maybe

1112
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,440
one other woman or two other women

1113
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,880
they're not always

1114
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,920
supportive and so you know the goal is

1115
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,240
always instead of being you know the

1116
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,079
queen bee and they call that the queen

1117
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:11,520
bee syndrome or whatever where the

1118
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,920
woman's mean to the other women kindred

1119
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,280
yeah yeah

1120
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,920
instead of the queen bee a team b like

1121
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,520
look to find a way to help to nurture

1122
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,440
either the next generation

1123
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,119
of women or the

1124
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,280
folks that yeah

1125
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,880
jumping off of that actually i want to

1126
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
go a little out of order from her agenda

1127
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
and jump to nikki's other recording um

1128
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,319
because she actually talks about an

1129
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,720
experience of you know this woman and

1130
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
woman competitiveness that didn't

1131
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,880
necessarily need to be there so yeah we

1132
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,400
could i know it doesn't say we're doing

1133
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,760
that next but if we could queue nicki's

1134
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,000
last pre-recorded let's talk a little

1135
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,599
bit about the future of female leaders

1136
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,880
in i.t i would love to hear your best

1137
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,680
and worst moment as a female leader

1138
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,040
okay

1139
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,680
um not proud of this i will start with

1140
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,240
my worst and i i don't think it's a

1141
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,720
moment i think it's a

1142
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,960
uh i think it was sort of a systemic

1143
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,800
issue so

1144
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,040
for many years starting off in my career

1145
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,040
i'd be on a team with all men or almost

1146
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,720
all men and

1147
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,119
um the system seemed to just sort of be

1148
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,880
set up where there was only room at the

1149
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,000
table for one woman and i think it's

1150
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,640
very easy to get caught in this trap as

1151
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,640
a high performing woman team member to

1152
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,359
see that anyone else coming in

1153
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,319
um

1154
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,359
was a threat to my own um

1155
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,079
my own placement within the team and so

1156
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,720
i think that uh you know this was

1157
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,400
perpetuated by

1158
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,880
you know people perceiving that this is

1159
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,160
female drama or cat fighting um and so

1160
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
i've spent a lot of time thinking about

1161
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,000
my role in those relationships with

1162
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,839
other women that i've either worked for

1163
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,359
or worked with

1164
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,760
and i i had a moment maybe five years

1165
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,680
ago where i worked with a female boss

1166
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,079
who was not much older than myself and i

1167
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,400
just feel like i was the worst version

1168
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,920
of myself we might have both been the

1169
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,000
worst versions of ourselves working

1170
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
together i didn't trust her i wanted to

1171
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,319
outsmart her i wanted to be the very

1172
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,079
best because that was where i was used

1173
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:13,040
to being on all male teams was having to

1174
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,359
work twice as hard for the position that

1175
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:18,079
i was in and having to just prove myself

1176
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:19,359
at every turn

1177
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,160
um and so i think that power struggle

1178
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,560
for us was very difficult

1179
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,000
we don't work together anymore we are

1180
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,800
friends but it was through that exchange

1181
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,000
and subsequent apologies to each other

1182
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,599
for the behavior that we both kind of um

1183
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,119
brought to that relationship that i

1184
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,640
recognized

1185
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,960
my own challenges with having been the

1186
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
only woman for most of my career i think

1187
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,280
it's very easy to fall into that trap of

1188
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,119
kind of liking to be the only woman and

1189
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:50,960
we really need

1190
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,880
we need that um

1191
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,400
gender parity and diversity on a team um

1192
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,880
so what i've i'd say that was my worst

1193
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,480
i'd say what my best moment has been

1194
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,440
is recognizing that as a problem being

1195
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
able to step back and really evaluate

1196
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,000
what led to that insecurity i mean a lot

1197
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,119
of it had to do with the fact that

1198
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,480
whenever i worked with another woman

1199
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,400
they were fantastic they were top of

1200
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,079
their game they were the best in their

1201
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,400
respective teams um because they've had

1202
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,599
to be and so

1203
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,440
i think um

1204
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,599
you know now i think this leads to a lot

1205
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,119
of burnout like i mentioned and a lot of

1206
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,040
situations where women are pulling a lot

1207
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,119
more weight at home and at work but i

1208
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,200
think that's a separate conversation but

1209
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,119
in terms of what i've kind of tried to

1210
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,760
atone for in my own career

1211
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,160
it's really mentoring women fostering

1212
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,920
those relationships versus looking at

1213
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,800
this as a pie and only having so much

1214
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,119
pie to go around and really

1215
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,960
just trying to kind of change that and

1216
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,359
not look at this as this is what i went

1217
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:50,800
through so this is what you're going to

1218
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,680
have to go through as well

1219
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,560
thanks nikki

1220
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,599
so

1221
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,000
so we're getting closer to about 17

1222
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,319
minutes left um fergus how are we doing

1223
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,240
on questions in the queue yet

1224
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,359
nothing okay so we'll keep going then

1225
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:06,960
we've got plenty of questions to keep

1226
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,800
busy with does anybody in the room want

1227
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,240
to ask anyone questions yet you want me

1228
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,160
to open up for q a here

1229
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
let's let's take one question and then

1230
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,920
we can jump back

1231
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
we got rescued from the best and worst

1232
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,520
moment that was good i've come back to

1233
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,160
it though if we have time

1234
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,079
hi um dinesh babute in personal capacity

1235
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,240
i've got a few comments to make and also

1236
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,760
maybe a question so

1237
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,280
let me just read them i was taking notes

1238
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,680
at the back um you mentioned imposter

1239
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,839
syndrome and something i'd like to say

1240
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,160
from my own personal perspective is

1241
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,359
people say to me that i'm really

1242
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,599
confident but the fact is i actually do

1243
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,200
have imposter syndrome as well so it's

1244
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,240
not

1245
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:49,119
just females it's everyone and it

1246
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,880
surprised me when i realized that i had

1247
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,319
imposter syndrome

1248
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,640
so it it will he it will hit everyone at

1249
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,000
some point so it's everywhere um

1250
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,800
the confidence building stuff um

1251
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,920
and being a leader i i take that as

1252
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,079
needing to nurture like a parent

1253
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,000
um because you know you nurture your

1254
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,880
children um they make mistakes you allow

1255
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,960
them to make mistakes because actually

1256
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,640
learning from experience and what i

1257
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,200
found in this industry is that when i

1258
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,040
was younger much much younger i was

1259
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,640
allowed to make mistakes but the

1260
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,640
industry has changed so much in that

1261
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,280
time that everyone is so specialized and

1262
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,960
as you said you're not allowed to make

1263
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,520
mistakes but as leaders as parents with

1264
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,920
that parent mentality let's say

1265
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:35,200
if you are a parent um nurture your

1266
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,400
staff

1267
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,440
allow them to make mistakes um

1268
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,200
and and let them learn from that but

1269
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,960
that also comes down to

1270
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
us who are at particular positions in

1271
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,800
the industry at particular levels

1272
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,800
particular statuses where we actually

1273
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,640
need to be conscious about taking a step

1274
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,680
back

1275
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,200
we need to take a step back and become

1276
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,440
mentors rather than actually holding on

1277
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,280
to our job so you know i will say this

1278
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,200
and we need to retire and die off

1279
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,240
basically and allow the younger

1280
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:01,760
generations to come up

1281
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,280
um

1282
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,920
and there was one more point um

1283
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,599
oh yes no two more points actually i

1284
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,960
think that this needs to start from an

1285
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:10,500
early age as well so um

1286
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,000
[Music]

1287
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,720
for for females and other non-male

1288
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,280
genders um we need to encourage from a

1289
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,520
very very early age um and i don't think

1290
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,000
that's happening i i i look at my

1291
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,079
daughter in school and they they already

1292
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:26,560
have this notion of what's a boy's job

1293
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,560
and what's a girl's job

1294
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:29,760
and i think

1295
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,079
as a society we need to do something

1296
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,599
about that so my question to the panel

1297
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,599
would be what can we as a nano community

1298
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,200
and the wider global community do about

1299
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,119
that so that's my question and the other

1300
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:40,720
thing is i think we need to change

1301
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,400
interview questions and change interview

1302
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,680
styles

1303
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,920
i'm i'm not entirely sure

1304
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,880
whether

1305
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,720
the industry is prepared for that but i

1306
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:49,839
think that's something that we need to

1307
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:52,000
be very very conscious of

1308
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,760
thank you thank you

1309
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,280
i had a point

1310
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,119
along those lines thank you for that

1311
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:58,640
that was that was

1312
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,119
very wonderful just to hear that

1313
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:03,440
i think that um one of the places where

1314
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,640
we could start we work in environments

1315
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,839
where we are measured on you know uptime

1316
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,280
availability

1317
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,560
you know

1318
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,720
breach free environments

1319
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,800
and they're very stressful and people

1320
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,520
work under a lot of stress for prolonged

1321
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,240
periods of time and catastrophes happen

1322
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,160
bad things are going to happen and

1323
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,680
resilience is one of those things that

1324
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,400
we're all constantly speaking of but

1325
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,880
when it comes down to the cultures in

1326
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,680
our organizations i think that we really

1327
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,880
have to lean toward a blame-free

1328
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,640
post-mortem culture so that when bad

1329
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,920
things happen

1330
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,119
people can kind of dissect go back and

1331
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,520
do a bit of a after action and

1332
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,000
understand you know what happened

1333
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,079
what could we have done better what do

1334
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:54,240
we want to

1335
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,359
do moving forward and some organizations

1336
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,839
that exist to a certain

1337
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,319
degree formally but in others it's

1338
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,160
really up to that executive it's up to

1339
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,160
that manager to make sure that everyone

1340
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,720
learns from the experience but that no

1341
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,520
one's to blame and i see

1342
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:14,000
i i've worked as a consultant

1343
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,599
for years i have my own consultancy and

1344
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,359
i would go into these environments so i

1345
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:22,480
got to sit with lots of executive teams

1346
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:23,680
all the time

1347
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,720
boy i tell you you know

1348
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:27,920
it's

1349
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,960
very true that at a certain level

1350
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,040
it's you know

1351
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,599
success has many fathers and failure is

1352
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,839
an orphan and nobody will sort of take

1353
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:40,240
the blame for the really tough stuff but

1354
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,319
as a leader that's what

1355
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,079
the buck should stop with you and you

1356
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,160
should help your folks if

1357
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,240
they need that kind of assistance but i

1358
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,079
think that's a cultural thing johnny do

1359
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:51,839
you want to also address the um how we

1360
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,599
make women more aware of the different

1361
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,119
positions and opportunities we have to

1362
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,040
them because that was one of them sure

1363
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,240
dinesh

1364
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,160
yeah the gentleman's comments were were

1365
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,839
so poignant thank you for that um there

1366
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:02,880
were a couple things that were brought

1367
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,319
up that i just want to address super

1368
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,640
quickly one is in technology in

1369
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,400
particular we're all going to feel

1370
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,160
impostor syndrome because we're measured

1371
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,160
on technical depth there's always going

1372
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:13,839
to be somebody who knows more than you

1373
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,359
somebody who wrote the textbook on the

1374
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,079
thing make peace right make peace with

1375
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,440
the fact that you know what you know it

1376
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,079
is good you contribute um the second

1377
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,760
thing is thank you for mentioning gender

1378
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,079
neutrality especially during gay pride

1379
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,520
month uh

1380
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,440
really appreciated and that

1381
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,640
is

1382
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,040
also a good segue for

1383
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,800
you know awareness it starts with

1384
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,240
awareness

1385
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,640
it starts with us as leaders using the

1386
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,960
right pronouns writing

1387
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,640
gender-neutral

1388
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:46,000
emails to our orgs uh making sure that

1389
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,480
our you know our job requisitions and

1390
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:50,800
our uh requisitions for leadership

1391
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,319
include this that kind of language um

1392
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,200
so

1393
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,440
it's um it's really about you and we

1394
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:58,880
said it earlier but it's really about

1395
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,839
modeling um but in terms of like the

1396
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:04,720
tactics um i think that availing

1397
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,359
ourselves of the organizations within if

1398
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,200
you work for a larger company that whose

1399
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,880
job it is to sort of get that megaphone

1400
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,839
out about opportunities about networking

1401
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,760
about leadership positions and if you

1402
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,359
don't work in a large company where

1403
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:19,040
those vehicles exist

1404
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,640
network the heck

1405
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,520
out of your career right never stop

1406
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,880
never stop

1407
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,520
and this is not gender specific network

1408
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,800
uh

1409
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,040
it will always those opportunities will

1410
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,640
arise through the development of a rich

1411
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,640
and broad uh professional network

1412
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,960
i absolutely agree with that and nanak

1413
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,880
is a perfect forum for that right um

1414
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,079
so i i do believe that

1415
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:51,119
the question was what can we do

1416
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,440
to bring

1417
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,920
excuse me

1418
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,960
to bring

1419
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,400
um

1420
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,280
more availability

1421
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,000
i think of

1422
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,599
positions opportunities

1423
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:10,240
to the group and to the to everyone i

1424
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,000
think and

1425
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,280
what can we do

1426
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,000
first of all i think we should all show

1427
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,599
up

1428
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,599
and it's important as cat had said that

1429
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:22,960
that she was

1430
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,720
able to have the opportunity to

1431
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,599
participate in the board meetings

1432
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,520
i think it's important that we are all

1433
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,760
sitting here and oh

1434
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,920
thank you great leadership help each

1435
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,599
other support we support each other and

1436
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,240
excuse me

1437
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,880
but also

1438
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,960
i just want to say i really hate public

1439
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,160
speaking and i keep

1440
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,520
i keep putting myself up here when i'm

1441
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,640
asked or sometimes even not because you

1442
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,960
want to show that

1443
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:59,680
you are showing up not just for yourself

1444
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,559
but for everyone else that's to come

1445
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,760
after you because nobody succeed on

1446
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,160
their own and it is

1447
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,040
built with teams and communities that we

1448
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,319
succeed

1449
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,119
you see rising stars they rise from a

1450
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:16,480
sea of stars

1451
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,119
right so um

1452
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,680
really well said and i love the fact

1453
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,240
that we're all coming together and

1454
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,720
please your comments

1455
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,480
to us and to anyone who's participating

1456
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,559
is so important to give a word of

1457
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,720
encouragement oh that was really well

1458
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,839
said i like what you've done and i you

1459
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,240
know i shared the same idea

1460
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,839
all those things supports the individual

1461
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,920
and helps yourself because next time

1462
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,480
then you know you know what i can go up

1463
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,720
there and i can speak and even when i

1464
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,440
make a blunder it's okay

1465
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,559
because we're humans and

1466
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,839
more practice makes it better

1467
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,000
would you like to add something to that

1468
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,119
nikki's live at this point i think they

1469
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:04,480
covered it

1470
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,559
i wish i could be there with everyone

1471
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,800
hopefully you can hear me okay

1472
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:11,040
yes

1473
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,319
yep

1474
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,520
i'm back

1475
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,040
um say your name

1476
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,000
adair internet too still the best

1477
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,240
um

1478
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,160
i was wondering if you ladies could

1479
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,559
speak um to

1480
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,640
women who are not necessarily

1481
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,640
neurotypical

1482
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,160
and how

1483
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,359
we present that differently than men who

1484
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,599
are not neurotypical

1485
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,240
how you recognize that and how you

1486
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,919
manage them any differently

1487
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:46,960
wow

1488
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,480
wow

1489
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,200
you

1490
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,640
you really

1491
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,160
it's rare that i don't have something to

1492
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,399
say

1493
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,319
sure you're all shocked uh i um as the

1494
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:03,040
mother of a uh an autistic son um

1495
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,520
that question is rocking me because i i

1496
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,839

1497
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:11,280

1499
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,040
been exposed to uh girls his age enough

1500
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,599
to know the differences um

1501
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,520
and i should know

1502
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,000

sorry go ahead and okay

1505
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,359
yeah go ahead you know i i i think um

1506
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,760
i'm not an expert in this by any stretch

1507
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,839
but i do think it it always starts with

1508
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,760
a conversation and it always starts with

1509
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,000
the conversation around how people like

1510
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,079
to work um

1511
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,040
you know

1512
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,079
how

1513
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,880
what environments are most comfortable

1514
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:47,760
for

1515
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:48,480
for

1516
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,640
people on your team

1517
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:53,119
and just having conversations and that

1518
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,440
i think that takes time and it takes

1519
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,000
trust obviously to be able to share

1520
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:58,960
um

1521
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,240
who you are and um and the different

1522
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:06,160
challenges i have a son who has adhd and

1523
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,240
so and then i have um

1524
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,319
you know have obviously worked with

1525
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,160
many different people and i i

1526
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,319
while i'm not an expert i would say it

1527
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,640
always starts with a conversation and

1528
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:19,359
and trust with uh between the leader and

1529
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,520
um the person that they're

1530
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,599
that they're working with

1531
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:24,480
great

1532
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,079
um so

1533
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,640
um just a little more information on

1534
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,119
specifically how women present um women

1535
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,200
on the autism spectrum are typically

1536
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,599
taught to mask their symptoms so they

1537
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:38,000
can better fit in

1538
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,960
and and socialize to

1539
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,200
be more neurotypical

1540
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,640
even though it's suppressing their

1541
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,480
impulses

1542
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,680
and

1543
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,480
women it are typically diagnosed later

1544
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,880
in life with adhd i know a lot of the

1545
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,839
people i've talked to today are in in

1546
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:58,079
yesterday and today have said oh yeah

1547
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:00,640
i'm adhd too i just got diagnosed a

1548
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,119
couple of years ago because they didn't

1549
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:04,960
tell me anything or i didn't think to

1550
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,799
look about it because

1551
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:10,319
it i don't act like the boys do

1552
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,000
i just got diagnosed a couple months ago

1553
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,559
i will share that with adhd as an adult

1554
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:16,480
in my thirties and they have to think

1555
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,000
that if you're constantly worried about

1556
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,760
masking symptoms the level of stress

1557
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,240
that it has to add

1558
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,280
to

1559
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,680
work and and personal life is enormous

1560
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,720
right

1561
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,240
i once worked with a woman i think

1562
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,720
there's clearly a gap

1563
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,079
sorry it's hard not being there i think

1564
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,680
there's clearly a gap right four women

1565
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,400
speechless on a stage um so to speak so

1566
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,920
i think there's clearly a gap and we

1567
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,359
probably need to hear from the people

1568
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,119
who are experiencing this

1569
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:45,040
um more so we can understand how we um

1570
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,520
how we change and how we modify our own

1571
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:48,960
leadership

1572
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,760
to accommodate those on our team

1573
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,000
absolutely i think that there are

1574
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,200
things that we need to think of as

1575
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,319
leaders

1576
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:59,760
around folks strengths whether whatever

1577
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,400
part of neurodiversity that we might be

1578
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,720
encountering i worked with a woman years

1579
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,960
ago who was ocd

1580
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,720
and she was

1581
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,799
no doubt the best threat hunter i've

1582
00:57:10,799 --> 00:57:13,599
ever known in my career and she was

1583
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,960
focused

1584
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,960
but she was also

1585
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,799
in a in a role that was uniquely suited

1586
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,599
to what she dealt with you know on a

1587
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:26,799
daily basis and i think that part of it

1588
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,400
is the conversation and sort of

1589
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,559
understanding everyone's different and

1590
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,119
understanding what that what that means

1591
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,520
and how that maps to what you're asking

1592
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,000
of someone and having some compassion

1593
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,280
and empathy around that because people

1594
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,079
with neurodiversity traits in any

1595
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,760
direction can be

1596
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,599
the most awesome employees i've lived

1597
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,880
that

1598
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,960
and they can be the most awesome humans

1599
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:51,680
too

1600
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,640
and i think from you know just

1601
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,920
an audience's perspective that

1602
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,359
you just need to have a little bit of

1603
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:02,559
respect and patience right uh i'm not a

1604
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,160
native english speaker so it is always

1605
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,640
super nervous for me to come up on stage

1606
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,720
because oh my god i can't get my tenses

1607
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,799
right i'm not using the correct verbs i

1608
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,599
don't know that particular vocabulary

1609
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,119
but guess what it's okay and i think

1610
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:20,079
that

1611
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,119
you have to and here's comes the you

1612
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,599
know allow yourself and allow others to

1613
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:28,880
make mistakes be kind to yourself and be

1614
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,400
kind to others

1615
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,000
and just give yourself the room and say

1616
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,200
you know what

1617
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,960
i'm human and it's it's okay to

1618
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:39,920
get my voice out and get my ideas out

1619
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:42,240
and if i don't deliver it perfectly it's

1620
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,640
still okay because it's more important

1621
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:48,078
that i deliver the idea

1622
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,240

afraid i'm not alright i have a woman on

1639
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,319
my team we're working together for many

00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,680
years so

1641
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,040
my question comes to um i know you guys

1642
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,280

you brought your career up to where you

1646
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:48,079
are right now um and the audience is

1647
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:50,880
it's mostly mayo so i'm going to the

1648
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,240
focus from uh woman leadership for how

1649
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,200
we as men on a leadership position we

1650
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,680
can support and so the question is

1651
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,720
actually

1652
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,000

1654
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:09,440
the team managers uh that have women on

1655
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,400
the team

1656
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,760

1657
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,760

like to hear too you know what so that

1661

you know having um you know that's uh

1663
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:27,680

hungry um so please try and keep it

1668
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:35,839
concise

1669
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:38,079
get to know the person right if it's a

1670
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,079
performance issue if it's a a root cause

1671
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,280
analysis

1672
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:45,599
um yes ask the questions that will

1673
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:47,680
dissect the situation but also ask

1674
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,839
questions about the person it will be

1675
01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:52,558
revelatory

1676
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:55,599
i agree with that it's getting to know

1677
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,400
the individual um it doesn't matter if

1678
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,119
it's male or female and i think

1679
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,040
letting them know you've got their back

1680
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:04,400
and

1681
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,960
and let them soar

1682
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,720
i would say be the type of leader that

1683
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,799
you want to see imagine yourself

1684
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:13,280
reporting to you

1685
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,359
nikki last thoughts

1686
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,319
listen

1687
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,880
right ask and then listen

1688
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:22,880
you'll probably get an earful

1689
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:27,040
is that you have a comment or a question

1690
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,559
um it relates to a bunch of questions

1691
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,000
that have been asked

1692
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,559
i'm one was with you guys to the

1693
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,400
nearer typical question

1694
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,359
um one unless williamson from aws one

1695
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,520
thing that i have found worked well is

1696
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,520
affinity groups and i think at the

1697
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,319
opening at nano there is the community

1698
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,040
as well where there is affinity group so

1699
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,520
in our different companies if we have

1700
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,680
affinity groups where people can thrive

1701
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,079
that come together and have

1702
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,839
educational cities and everything we

1703
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,160
find that that helps to be more

1704
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,720
inclusive and provide a space for those

1705
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,039
people and that is also available via

1706
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,480
nano the next one is with regards on f3

1707
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,640
the next one is um

1708
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:13,039
how to incorporate more young women

1709
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:13,839
um

1710
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:15,039
we have

1711
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,680
students from howard university and

1712
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:20,319
mostly women that are here that are from

1713
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:22,880
the younger generation so nano through

1714
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,640
its nci program is already doing stuff

1715
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,559
in that regard and i'm here as aws

1716
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,200
platinum sponsor is partnering with nano

1717
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,920
to make sure that happens and to make

1718
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,680
sure we reach so i think it's upon all

1719
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,799
of us to lean in to make that happen to

1720
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,480
make a better place for our daughters

1721
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,160
and the access of the

1722
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,760
and the last part i think also

1723
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,240
piggybacks on the last gentleman's

1724
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,839
comment with regards to advice first men

1725
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,440
again we'll be hosting the women in

1726
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,440
technology lunch and i invite you all to

1727
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,920
come you'll be hearing from manju who

1728
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,640
would give a used case of a real-life

1729
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,640
imposter syndrome and how she's overcome

1730
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,440
that

1731
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,440
but i say that because i'm a strong

1732
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,559
proponent for women equity and i'm a

1733
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:10,880
male standing here and i'm sure there

1734
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,359
are people of all the gender spectrum

1735
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,440
that are of the same type so what you

1736
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,400
can do

1737
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,359
is spaces where women are not you be

1738
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:22,079
that advocate you use your budget and

1739
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,480
you get in with women and you listen and

1740
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,960
you act upon it so that is the allyship

1741
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,760
of male so all the men in this room can

1742
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,559
become allies to make sure we work with

1743
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,480
