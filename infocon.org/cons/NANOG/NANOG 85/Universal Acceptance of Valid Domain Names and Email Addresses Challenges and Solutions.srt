[Music]

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,919
thank you all very much for giving me

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,320
the opportunity to talk about universal

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,400
acceptance of domain names and email

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,599
addresses at nanog i'll be providing a

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,480
technical interview um my name is uh

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,600
sarmadunsan and i am

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,439
at icann with the idn and ua programs

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:26,880
so we're all

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,199
familiar with the

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,439
domain names

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,238
and

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,440
here is an example of a

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
more traditional domain name which we

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,079
are all used to using

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,520
um each domain name actually consists of

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,559
a

18
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,360
series of labels

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,199
so you can which are separated by dots

20
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,399
so for example in this case you can

21
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,719
have

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,199
www.cafefrom123.com

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,359
which contains

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,760
dot or it contains com which is normally

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,040
referred to as a top level domain

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,680
and then you have cafe 123 which is a

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,479
second level domain and then www which

28
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,759
is a third level domain name or label

29
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,040
and so on

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,720
and collectively together they form a

31
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,640
completely realized domain name each of

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,439
these labels have uh some specific rules

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,159
uh which they need to follow for the for

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,720
these domain names to be valid

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,040
uh so for

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,159
second level and third level for example

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,200
the label must be formed by letters a

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,399
through z

39
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
digits 0 3 9

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,680
and hyphen a combination of these three

41
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,040
sets

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,119
and the length of a label cannot be more

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,560
than 63 characters or octets

44
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,479
and then there can be other constraints

45
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,759
so for example a label cannot start with

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,960
a hyphen and so on

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,600
however the top level domains are

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,239
slightly more special

49
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,080
than the other

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,319
domain names so for example in rfc1123

51
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,840
it suggests that

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
the top level domain names should be

53
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,720
alphabetic which means that the top

54
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,319
level domain names are restricted to

55
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,599
letters a through z and of course cannot

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,879
contain digits and hyphen

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,599
and then of course the label length of

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,800
63 still applies

59
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,959
so um

60
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,120
there has been us

61
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,800
you know early on since the domain names

62
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,519
became available uh communities across

63
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,360
the globe which have been using the

64
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
internet have also been sort of asking

65
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
for the ability to have domain names

66
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
in local

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,920
languages

68
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,800
and

69
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,040
the community of course has

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,440
worked

71
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
on making standards available

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,959
uh for this purpose um the first

73
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,040
standard uh which is normally referred

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,200
to as the internationalized domain name

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,239
standard

76
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:15,440
in

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,560
idn in applications uh standard

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,599
came out around 2003 so it's

79
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,239
referred to as idna 2003

80
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,560
which eventually matured

81
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,519
to a second revision in

82
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,400
around 2008 so it's normally referred to

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,519
as

84
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:35,040
internationalized domain names and

85
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,360
applications 2008 or idna 2008 standard

86
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,799
it is

87
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,920
similar

88
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,200
to

89
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
what happens in ascii so this is an

90
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,720
example of a

91
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,120
domain name in tibetan script

92
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,760
again we have labels separated by a dot

93
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,640
and

94
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,080
however

95
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,760
to make sure that the

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,239
domain name can be implemented in any of

97
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,319
the different scripts available

98
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,319
the encoding scheme is no longer

99
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,720
dependent on ascii but actually uses

100
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,840
unicode

101
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
and uh valid uh

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
domain name label uh

103
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,120
as per idna 2008 now

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
is normally referred to as a you label

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,880
or i guess a short of saying it's based

106
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,479
on unicode

107
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,520
um

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,479
and

109
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,520
it is uh

110
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
basically

111
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
using a similar scheme as the letter

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,840
digit hyphen or ldh scheme

113
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,919
um in in the sense that

114
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,919
in the unicode it

115
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,560
you can form labels using normally

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,759
letters marks and numbers

117
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,400
there are more details about what the

118
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,759
constraints on

119
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
forming labels uh within the idna

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,520
standard which is

121
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,440
based on rfcs 58 19 through 94.

122
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,120
and then for top level of course

123
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,639
in the unicode format only letters uh

124
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,479
the letter principle applies which means

125
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,560
of course digits are not allowed and so

126
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,240
on so if

127
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
we are really talking about uh

128
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,919
internationalizing the domain name

129
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,720
system uh we really need to work on all

130
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,400
the different scripts

131
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,840
and make sure that we can

132
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
figure out what is the subset of

133
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,400
characters or letters or code points

134
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,440
which can be allowed in domain names and

135
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,720
as i shared uh there is an algorith

136
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,960
algorithmic way uh which is used uh

137
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
in the

138
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,440
uh

139
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,240
idna 2008 standard

140
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,440
which uses character properties

141
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,199
in unicode

142
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,639
and calculations algorithmically in

143
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,360
addition to

144
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
just calculating a short list of what

145
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
characters are allowed in domain names

146
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
we actually have a

147
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,680
another

148
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,759
problem which obviously needs to be

149
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,600
resolved

150
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,720
so we

151
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,319
you know when we

152
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,240
do the more traditional domain names

153
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
which are based in on ascii standard

154
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,280
we are really dealing with one script

155
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,800
which is latin script and we're really

156
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
dealing with 63 characters out of the

157
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
127 which are allowed

158
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,160
if you move to unicode the problem

159
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,720
obviously is much bigger

160
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
to resolve because you know just looking

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
at unicode 11 version

162
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,919
it had encoded 148 scripts

163
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,479
and had 137 000

164
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,560
more than 137 000

165
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,319
possible characters

166
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,720
encode it so the question of course

167
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
becomes how many of these scripts and

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,680
how many of these characters actually

169
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,639
should be allowed and not only that but

170
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,800
what it does is that it increases the

171
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,759
confusibility of possible domain names

172
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,840
we already know that there is obviously

173
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,319
some possible confusions even in ascii

174
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,440
so for example uh the lowercase l can be

175
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,880
confused by the number one but when we

176
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,520
go from 63 letters of

177
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,560
characters to you know 137 000

178
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,639
characters we

179
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,080
have

180
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,560
that particular confusibility to deal

181
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,599
with in a much larger scale so i give

182
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,280
some examples here from different

183
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,360
scripts and the confusability can occur

184
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
in many ways so there is visual

185
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,800
confusion confusibility so for example

186
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,039
if you look at the second two

187
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,080
domain names for the first set or in

188
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
arabic script you'll see that visually

189
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,639
they're identical the second and the

190
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,400
third labels

191
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,160
even though technically they're quite

192
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,319
distinct because one of the characters

193
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,400
actually is it

194
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,319
it's actually different but it's

195
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,280
visually identical in chinese there's a

196
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,360
different problem where

197
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,759
even though visually characters can be

198
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,440
distinct but they're perceived as

199
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,240
exactly the same because chinese uses

200
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
two kinds of writing systems uh the

201
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,560
simplified chinese and the traditional

202
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
chinese and the users of chinese script

203
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,960
can actually mix these two sets of

204
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,039
characters so they can perceive these

205
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,199
two visually distinct

206
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,000
labels as the same and then we can

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,400
actually have transcript variant labels

208
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
so

209
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,120
the example of epic hair in english

210
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,679
looks identical to another string

211
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,240
in cyrillic script which we use to write

212
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,719
for example languages like russian even

213
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,480
though technically the code points in

214
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,440
unicode are all distinct so we also have

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,839
to deal with these kind of

216
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,440
issues

217
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,680
and

218
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,080
you know there are obviously mechanisms

219
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,320
which are used uh to deal with it um

220
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,399
i am going to talk a little more about

221
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
uh how we are dealing uh in this

222
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,920
for these kind of cases

223
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,800
for

224
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,120
top level domains

225
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,640
for the root zone of the internet

226
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,560
so what we

227
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,600
did at icann was

228
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,760
you know this was a problem to solve for

229
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
uh top level domains we want to make

230
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,480
sure that top level domains are

231
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,839
unique uh not only technically but also

232
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,160
unique from

233
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,959
you know perception of end users

234
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,600
if end users consider two labels the

235
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,600
same

236
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,399
then

237
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,160
of course even though

238
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
as we saw that technically they could be

239
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,680
different labels

240
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
but they can cause a significant amount

241
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
of confusion

242
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
for the end users and therefore we want

243
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,720
to of course identify

244
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
things or labels which are

245
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
in some ways the same

246
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,839
we call these variant

247
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,360
labels and

248
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
or variant code points in case we're

249
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,399
talking about

250
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,320
it at a code point level

251
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
and one of the things which i can

252
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
realize earlier on when we are making

253
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
these rules for

254
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,480
roots on it

255
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,800
for the root zone or top level domains

256
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
was that of course

257
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,680
the

258
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,839
strength or understanding of each script

259
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,680
lies with the community which uses the

260
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,800
script

261
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,120
so what we've actually done

262
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,000
in with the guidance of the community is

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,160
we've developed what are called the root

264
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,800
zone label generation rules which can be

265
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,279
used to develop the top level domains

266
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,480
and also identify any variant labels and

267
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,079
the way it has worked is that we've

268
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,440
actually reached out to all the

269
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,519
different script communities so we've

270
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,279
worked with the chinese community the

271
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,440
korean community the cyrillic script

272
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,079
community latin community

273
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,120
arabic script community and so on so

274
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,760
we formulated panels for each of the

275
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,399
communities which used these scripts and

276
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,680
provided them with in a way a guidance

277
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
through a procedure

278
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,959
to develop these root zone lgrs and the

279
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,800
each of the community worked over

280
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,519
multiple years to devise the

281
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,240
quote-unquote right solution to develop

282
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
top-level domains and each community

283
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,279
would develop a solution hand it over to

284
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,720
a panel which icon has hosted this panel

285
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,200
is independent and consists of experts

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,560
from unicode and dns and idn's and they

287
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
take in the proposal from each of the

288
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
script community and integrate into one

289
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,839
set of rules

290
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,480
which we call the root zone lgr which

291
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
you can take a look at this there's a

292
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,680
link

293
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,720
to it

294
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,120
in this slide and those rules are then

295
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
used to formulate the right top level

296
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,279
domains and also identify any various

297
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,600
labels top level domain name labels are

298
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
now

299
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,959
also possible icon actually has been

300
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,440
working with the community to allocate

301
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
or delegate both the country code level

302
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
top level domains and the generic

303
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
top-level domains in local languages and

304
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,600
scripts so for on the in the cc space or

305
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,279
in the cctlds that there's already 62

306
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,279
strings which have been evaluated

307
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,360
successfully from 43 countries and

308
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,240
territories and of these 61 have already

309
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
been delegated into the root zone on the

310
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,320
generic top level domain side as well in

311
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,639
the 2012 round

312
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,600
community was able to apply for strings

313
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
in local languages

314
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,839
and so far there are 92

315
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,079
internationalized domain names

316
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,560
delegated as top level domains generic

317
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,639
top-level domains um and you can come

318
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,720
see a complete list of these

319
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,399
in the inr database select from here so

320
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,200
that

321
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,240
also brings us to a new

322
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,839
challenge

323
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,040
which is

324
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
obviously

325
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,200
getting these domain names and the email

326
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,120
addresses formed using these domain

327
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
names you know getting these universally

328
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,200
accepted by all the different

329
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,560
applications

330
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,760
um

331
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,279
and

332
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,760
that's uh obviously expected but that's

333
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,600
not true at this time

334
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,160
um so the goal for universal acceptance

335
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,160
program

336
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,200
at ican as well as the work being done

337
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,760
by the community

338
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,839
on universal acceptance is that all

339
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,600
domain names and email addresses should

340
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,360
work in all the software applications

341
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,560
uh and of course it has very uh deep uh

342
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,519
impact uh in the sense that uh

343
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,760
uh you know having

344
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,560
uh

345
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
all the domain names and email addresses

346
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,360
accepted provides a significant consumer

347
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,480
choice

348
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
to people

349
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,079
around the globe it improves competition

350
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,480
in the industry and provides a better

351
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,639
access to end users

352
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,279
especially those who obviously

353
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,279
read and write in a different

354
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,639
script and language so it's an essential

355
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,279
sort of prerequisite for all this to

356
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
work and here's some possible examples

357
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,800
of what's new and what is possible

358
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
so since the new gtld round uh for

359
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,519
top-level domains

360
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,880
in 2012 and also the cctld uh idnc ctld

361
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,760
fast track process which was instituted

362
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,480
by the icann and its community

363
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,440
in 2009 as i shared it is now possible

364
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,199
to have many more new top level domains

365
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,399
there are

366
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,120
a newer top level domains also in s key

367
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,360
space so you can have something like dot

368
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,519
sky insert in addition to

369
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,480
dot com or dot org or dot net which are

370
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,120
the more traditional ones and it is also

371
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,000
possible to have longer domain names so

372
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,320
the longest we've had earlier was dot

373
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,160
museum which was six

374
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,399
characters uh but now you can actually

375
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,040
have or you there is uh top-level

376
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,040
domains uh which are delegated which are

377
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,440
much longer

378
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,959
like.international and dot engineering

379
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,760
and technology and so on and as we saw

380
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,000
earlier that the level domain can

381
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
actually be as long as 63

382
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,440
characters so so applications which are

383
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,160
for example validating domain names they

384
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
need to make sure

385
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,680
that if you're using for example a

386
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,600
regular expression or a regex for short

387
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,759
you need to make sure that top level

388
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,120
domains

389
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
are not

390
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,560
limited to just two to four or two to

391
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,759
six letters but they can actually go

392
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,120
much longer

393
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,120
and then the third example shows that

394
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,279
you can actually have a domain name uh

395
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,040
in any other script as well so this is

396
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,440
an example of a thai domain name

397
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,959
as we'll see

398
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,519
regular expressions of course will not

399
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
work very well if you're

400
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,240
validating domain names because it will

401
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,440
obviously

402
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,199
not work well for internationalized

403
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,600
amendments there can be some similarly

404
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,279
internationalized email addresses as

405
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,800
well which we say eai for short

406
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,360
which stands for email address

407
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,959
internationalization and um you'll you

408
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,399
can see that there are all these

409
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,079
different kinds of email addresses

410
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
including email addresses which can be

411
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
totally in a local

412
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
language like uh

413
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,040
which contains unicode in utf-8 format

414
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,959
before that sign and then

415
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,959
internationalized domain name after that

416
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,839
site

417
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,519
so if you're

418
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,000
working in applications

419
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,519
or email tools you need to make sure

420
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,839
that such email addresses are actually

421
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:38,720
also

422
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
processed appropriately by by your

423
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,399
technology you know to go deeper

424
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,800
universal acceptance

425
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,360
basically means that all domain names

426
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,519
are accepted or can be accepted

427
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,440
validated processed stored and displayed

428
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
similarly all email addresses should

429
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,040
also be able to

430
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
you know be accepted validated process

431
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,959
stored and displayed by all the

432
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,359
different applications uh

433
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,199
which you are developing or you're

434
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,400
hosting

435
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,760
you're configuring

436
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,480
so that's sort of the goal it's uh

437
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,559
easier said than done so what we've been

438
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,880
doing in collaboration with the

439
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,319
community community-led

440
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,799
group which looks at this problem it's

441
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,559
called universal acceptance steering

442
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,520
group

443
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,319
or uasg for short we've actually been

444
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,359
looking at

445
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,240
how

446
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,320
what are the gaps in universal

447
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,559
acceptance at this time so we've

448
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,880
actually uh one of the studies which we

449
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,520
did was uh we actually went to

450
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,120
about a thousand

451
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,880
uh websites uh globally uh so we took a

452
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,080
top 1000 websites from for example alexa

453
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,600
rankings

454
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,480
and

455
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
what we did was we went to their contact

456
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,799
us page and normally at the contact us

457
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,240
page

458
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
the websites would allow

459
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,360
you to submit your email address so that

460
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,240
they can get back to you so what we did

461
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
was for each of those

462
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,400
1000 websites we submitted one of these

463
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,919
different kinds of email addresses and

464
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,120
the new short is like dot sky and new

465
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,440
long island

466
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,679
you know example was dot international

467
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,000
in from the previous slide even those

468
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
which are purely ascii

469
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
we see that the recognition of those

470
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,080
domain names sorry email addresses with

471
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,840
those top level domains is not hundred

472
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
percent a new short is close to 98

473
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,760
percent now

474
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,320
but uh new long like dot international

475
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,280
technology is still around 85 which

476
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,440
means 150 websites out of the thousand

477
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,679
said that this is an invalid email

478
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,559
address which was not true but if you

479
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,280
eventually go to all chinese or all

480
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,320
arabic

481
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
which are internationalized email

482
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,799
addresses only about 11

483
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,280
so 110 websites out of a thousand

484
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
consider these as valid email addresses

485
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,160
and you know close to 900 websites out

486
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,360
of a thousand

487
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
just reject these

488
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,360
email addresses saying that these are

489
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,760
invalid email addresses and prompt to

490
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,320
obviously ask a valid email address even

491
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,559
though the email addresses we were using

492
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,640
were actually valid and working so

493
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,799
that's a problem to solve

494
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
and that's what uh i guess we'll be

495
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,039
talking about today uh we are also

496
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,600
looking at email servers in addition to

497
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
websites so

498
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,360
what we did was we actually went to the

499
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,679
zone files use the zone files of of

500
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,320
about 11 1180 uh gtld zones uh which

501
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,200
have around 210 million

502
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,679
uh domain name registrations

503
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,480
uh and we looked at the mx records to

504
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,160
find out the

505
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,720
mail servers against these

506
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,440
zone files and found about 35 million

507
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
mail servers

508
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
which were pointed to by about 2.5

509
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,400
million ip addresses

510
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,640
what we did was that we pinged

511
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
these ip addresses

512
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,520
with the with different kinds of

513
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,919
email ids including

514
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,559
i guess internationalized email ids

515
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,679
and um saw whether they responded

516
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,280
uh with

517
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,400
the right flag which we'll see is

518
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,640
smtp utf-8 flag

519
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,400
which tells

520
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
the sending

521
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
server

522
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,080
that

523
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,679
the receiving server supports

524
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,640
internationalized email addresses

525
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,880
and what we found was that only seven

526
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,280
percent so we do this at study every

527
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,919
quarter and we find found that towards

528
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,640
the

529
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
end of uh last year

530
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,600
uh about only seven percent of the

531
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,120
email servers

532
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,200
are configured

533
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,720
to respond to

534
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,640
internationalized email addresses and so

535
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,919
that's a

536
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,039
93

537
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,679
percent gap in email servers which need

538
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,000
to be upgraded to support these kind of

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
email addresses so of course the problem

540
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,280
can lie

541
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,159
from an application point of view lie at

542
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,000
any of the layers

543
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,360
sometimes the standards are

544
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,960
not supporting

545
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
such email addresses

546
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,880
sometimes

547
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,960
the operating there's gaps in operating

548
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,640
system layers sometimes the programming

549
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
languages are not supporting it and even

550
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,840
if everything works at the lower layers

551
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,440
sometimes just the applications are

552
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,360
developed and not keeping these things

553
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,799
in mind similarly for um on the mail

554
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,760
side you know for for emails to work all

555
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,120
of the

556
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,880
mail user agents submission agents

557
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,520
transfer agents and delivery agents

558
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,440
in the path of the email must be

559
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,280
supporting

560
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,120
email address internationalization for

561
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,039
an email to be

562
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,760
successfully sent from a user to a

563
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,960
receiver

564
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
any one of the agents in the path is not

565
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,200
able to support internationalized email

566
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
addresses of course the email will be

567
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,679
rejected and bounced back based on the

568
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,000
problem we are solving um

569
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,679
i'm going to share

570
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,760
some of the more fundamental details

571
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,960
about domain names and email addresses

572
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,760
which

573
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,280
of course

574
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,480
are relevant

575
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,280
and

576
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,880
what we need to fix

577
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,919
what i'll do is for this part of the

578
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,799
slides i'll go slightly faster

579
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,799
and just to make sure that we can cover

580
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,559
this in time

581
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,440
but

582
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,159
happy to take any questions uh

583
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,600
at the end of the

584
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,520
presentation uh in case there are

585
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,360
you know more clarifications which i

586
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,000
needed so some of this we've actually

587
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,960
talked about um but just to introduce

588
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,640
unicode

589
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
encodes uh

590
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,480
characters across all the different

591
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,200
scripts of the world and it normally

592
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,400
uses a u plus x x x x notation in uh

593
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,480
identifying all the different characters

594
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,960
so for example e in latin script is uh

595
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,960
encoded as u plus zero zero six five for

596
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,320
ascii

597
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,799
the unicode codes and the ascii codes

598
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,320
are

599
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,000
same or similar if you can see sk65su

600
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,840
unicode 0065

601
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,080
and these uh unicode

602
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,640
data is normally stored in unicode text

603
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,520
files uh unicode base text files which

604
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,280
are normally in

605
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,400
utf-8 format that's one of the formats

606
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,880
one thing to realize is that not each

607
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,320
script is uh encoded in uh

608
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,000
you know single byte or two bytes it's

609
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,480
actually variable byte format so a

610
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,400
character in one script may actually be

611
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,320
stored in one byte but a character a

612
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
single character another script actually

613
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,320
could be stored in two bytes

614
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,440
and you can look at uh utf-8 format

615
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,039
in more detail to

616
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,760
see how to interpret and read those

617
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,039
files another thing to note is that

618
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,679
unicode can you can represent a single

619
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,159
character in multiple ways so e with an

620
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,720
accent here can be represented in

621
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,679
unicode directly with 0 0 e 8 or it can

622
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
actually be represented in with two code

623
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,200
points e followed by an accent which is

624
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,200
a combining mark to address the

625
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,440
ambiguity because then user can actually

626
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
type the same string in two ways

627
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,360
unicode introduces normalization forms

628
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,440
which map all the different input

629
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,400
possibilities

630
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
into a single string has multiple unit

631
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,840
normalization forms but idna 2008 uses

632
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,120
nfc normalization from c which would map

633
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,000
these two strings onto zero e8 so even

634
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,400
if you enter zero zero six five and plus

635
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,240
zero three hundred and

636
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,960
uh do an nfc conversion

637
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,880
with in your programming language it

638
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,960
will convert that to zero zero eight

639
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,640
other things to note is uh that the

640
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,320
you know we've already talked about how

641
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,240
the domain names are formed and what the

642
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,799
top level domains but

643
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,760
the top level domains are not fixed so

644
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,520
the root zone database actually lists

645
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,200
the current uh

646
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,960
top-level domains which are delegated

647
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,440
but these actually change over time

648
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,760
and similarly um

649
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
we've also looked at

650
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,200
internationalized domain names which

651
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,039
actually can be formed

652
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,240
by using

653
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,120
a non-ascii letter in one of the labels

654
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,960
in any one of the labels

655
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,600
um and we've seen that there was an

656
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,720
earlier version or which was 2003 but we

657
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,880
now want to make sure that if we are now

658
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,279
programming for idns

659
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,600
it the programming must support idna

660
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,919
2008 standard which is the more recent

661
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,679
standard ideas uh have two forms so this

662
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,080
is an important piece of information to

663
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,240
note that we've looked at idn's or

664
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,679
internationalized domain names in the

665
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,919
ulable format of the unicode format

666
00:25:57,919 --> 00:25:59,600
that's normally intended for human

667
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,320
consumption because as humans we read in

668
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,120
our own script and language but

669
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,799
as far as the machines are concerned

670
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,360
internally each u label is

671
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,720
mapped onto

672
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,559
equivalent ascii

673
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,520
label

674
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
which is normally referred to as a label

675
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,400
and internally in the systems everything

676
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
can actually be processed in the a label

677
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,400
format and then there is there are

678
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,880
conversion utilities or libraries which

679
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,039
are normally available to make you label

680
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,200
to a level conversion and back

681
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,120
this is a lossless conversion but when

682
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,640
you're making it make sure that you're

683
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,039
using a library which is conforming to

684
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,200
idna 2008

685
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,720
and not the older version idna 2003 when

686
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
we convert it into ascii format of

687
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,480
course it is not possible to distinguish

688
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
a regular ascii from a

689
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,440
new level converted to ascii so what

690
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,480
idna 2008 standard has done

691
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,279
is

692
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,440
said that

693
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,799
idns

694
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,679
will

695
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,799
be prefixed by xn dash dash so anything

696
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,679
which

697
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,440
or hyphen hyphen

698
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
anything which starts with x and hyphen

699
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,720
hyphen is always interpreted as an idn

700
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,200
and not an ascii string and therefore

701
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,159
also

702
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,080
ascii strings are not allowed to have

703
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,440
xn hyphen hyphen before that

704
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,559
so that suppress these two namespaces uh

705
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,520
email addresses as well uh we've seen

706
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,799
that

707
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,440
when we write a mailbox name domain name

708
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,440
and now it is possible to have mailbox

709
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,440
name in udf8 format

710
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,080
and domain name in

711
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,799
basically an idn format

712
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,799
so it is now possible to have domain

713
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,159
names

714
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,559
and email addresses both in local

715
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:49,039
languages and scripts so when you're

716
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,720
developing your own systems either

717
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,399
websites or you're configuring your mail

718
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,520
servers you need to make sure that your

719
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,279
website or domain name is properly

720
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,559
configured

721
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,360
we've developed a testing framework

722
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,720
which is a document we call usg026

723
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,200
which provides uh detailed tests which

724
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,200
you could do at various stages we

725
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,279
encourage you to look at those

726
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:14,640
in case you would like to fix your

727
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,440
or update your

728
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,440
applications to make sure that they are

729
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,279
ua ready

730
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,600
and there are additional test data so we

731
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,240
actually provide email addresses and

732
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,320
working email addresses and domain names

733
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,520
and all the different languages and

734
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,399
scripts

735
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,799
which you can use as test data for

736
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,360
testing your applications we actually

737
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,840
went out and looked at how

738
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,720
we can program for ui readiness

739
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,240
and we've actually been looking at all

740
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,080
the different programming languages and

741
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,559
found that not all libraries which are

742
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,320
available to support idns or emails are

743
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,279
compliant with the ua

744
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,640
meaning that they support

745
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,320
internationalized domain names and

746
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,640
internationalized email addresses

747
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,600
so we've actually been publishing data

748
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,440
there's a study

749
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
on programming languages

750
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,799
the summary is here which shows which

751
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,360
particular libraries you should be using

752
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,039
in case you are

753
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,320
programming for supporting ua correctly

754
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,799
and which lang libraries may actually

755
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,399
not work well

756
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,279
to support such domain names and email

757
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,919
addresses so when you're programming for

758
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,559
website for example and so on uh please

759
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,559
make sure you're using the correct uh

760
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,159
libraries

761
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,000
um and if you're using some other

762
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,679
libraries make sure you can actually

763
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,320
program the extra bit to

764
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,919
make sure that you do support ua as far

765
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:42,720
as

766
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
email address into nationalization is

767
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,960
concerned just as a starting point

768
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,240
please do go to usg.tech slash eai

769
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
hyphen check

770
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,320
to enter your own email address and this

771
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,919
will tell you whether the server your

772
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,919
email server supports internationalized

773
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,080
email addresses it actually gives you a

774
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,360
message back

775
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,200
it checks your pings your server and

776
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,279
checks and tells you

777
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,440
whether your server is compliant or not

778
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,679
google for example is compliant so if

779
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,080
you use your gmail address in here it

780
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,159
will say that it works

781
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,559
but you can check your own email servers

782
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
through your own email addresses

783
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,520
eventually

784
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,159
as was said that both smtp and pop and

785
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,640
imap need to be upgraded

786
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,799
uh to address uh internationalized email

787
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,440
addresses smtp especially uses a new

788
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,080
flag smtp utf-8

789
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,480
which needs to be i guess provided

790
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,880
during the server and receiver

791
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,880
transactions as we'll see in the next

792
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,919
few slides and uh so you must be using

793
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,039
software

794
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,080
or software tools email tools which do

795
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,919
support uh eeai for it to work properly

796
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,600
and this is an example of what is

797
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,240
happening when actually a sender

798
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,000
connects with a

799
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,039
receiver

800
00:30:59,039 --> 00:30:59,919
the two

801
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,880
mtas or mail transfer agents obviously

802
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,960
talk to each other

803
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,360
when the initial

804
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,559
signal is

805
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,919
e hello is sent by the sender

806
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,000
receiver normally responds with a set of

807
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,320
flags and one of the things to see is

808
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,440
that it does respond with an smtp utf-8

809
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,080
flag if it does then the receiver is

810
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
configured to receive internationalized

811
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,559
email addresses and you can for example

812
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,519
send a chinese email address with an

813
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,279
smtp-822x lag telling the receiver that

814
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,720
here is a

815
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,760
email address which should be

816
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
interpreted as an internet size email

817
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,519
address and recall is good

818
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,120
but if any of the servers or any

819
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,279
agents in the

820
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,000
path does not support internationalized

821
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,360
email addresses

822
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,760
the mail would bounce back

823
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,600
we've actually also been looking at the

824
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,720
different user agent or different agents

825
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,840
users submission transfer delivery and

826
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,919
agents available

827
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,519
and we

828
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,600
you know this provides a summary of what

829
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,919
level of ei support they provide

830
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,600
level one means that they can send and

831
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,000
receive but you cannot generate an email

832
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,200
address new mailbox in local language

833
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
level 2 supports of course

834
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,880
says that you can even

835
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,360
generate a local language email address

836
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,640
in addition to

837
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,480
sending and receiving and there are many

838
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,960
more details about the study in the

839
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,440
document usg030a

840
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,080
so

841
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,760
we've actually

842
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,720
been developing our own uh systems or

843
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,880
making our own systems viewer ready

844
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,200
as well at ican

845
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,960
we

846
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,799
did this in a three-step process where

847
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:43,919
we were

848
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,799
first

849
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,120
incrementally updating our systems to

850
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,279
support all the different ascii

851
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,039
long and short

852
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,799
top-level domains in the next step we

853
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,960
were supporting idns

854
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,640
and in the third step we are now

855
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,559
configuring everything to make sure that

856
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,559
eai or email address

857
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,120
internationalization is also

858
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,279
workable in all our systems and you can

859
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,360
read that in the icons case study which

860
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,799
we published so we have done a lot of

861
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,039
work in collaboration that this work is

862
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,519
spearheaded by you universalist of dead

863
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,440
steering group which is a community led

864
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,039
volunteer group

865
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,960

organizers

889
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,839
to

890
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,560
for

891
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,239
questions and answers thank you

892
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:18,079
okay thank you very much samir do we

893
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,839
have any questions for the presenter

894
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,200
they go into the microphone

895
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,760
hello i don't have one question you

896
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,679
asked which is that

897
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,760
uh just because weaving

898
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
we started to accept all these like

899
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,599
different character domain names and

900
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,320
emails would that create like a

901
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,520
vector for attacks because of fishing

902
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,599
because a lot of similar characters are

903
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,520
going to be accepted

904
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,679
and the it sounds like this could create

905
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,359
a problem for

906
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,480
like even

907
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,400
currently users are used to checking

908
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,839
their ascii

909
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:01,680
character names

910
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,760
it's like easy to tell like it's zero

911
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,400
and an o apart but it will be harder for

912
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,079
communicate characters i was wondering

913
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,839
if we're prepared for this kind of

914
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:10,880
problems

915
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,599
that's all thank you

916
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,200
thank you this is uh summer thank you

917
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,560
for the question

918
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,079
um so

919
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,920
there is uh

920
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,880
ongoing work uh on

921
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,760
uh looking at phishing there is actually

922
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,960
been some initial studies uh on whether

923
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,240
there is uh

924
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,240
you know the level of phishing with the

925
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,320
internationalized domain names

926
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,839
uh and

927
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,720
those initial studies at least do not uh

928
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,320
show

929
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,079
any any you know significantly more

930
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:46,880
uh

931
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,280
phishing through ideas

932
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,520
um however uh also as uh as we shared

933
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,119
that uh you know

934
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,119
as far as top level domains are

935
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,280
concerned we've actually been working

936
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
with the community

937
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,920
over past many years to make sure

938
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,280
that

939
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,520
the labels which we define

940
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,320
they're done in a way that

941
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,359
any uh at least uh visual or any other

942
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,078
kind of uh

943
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,880
identicalness of labels which

944
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,359
may cause confusion for end users it is

945
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,280
actually addressed so

946
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,320
the root zone label generation rules

947
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,839
solution

948
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,119
which has been developed by the

949
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,119
different script communities for

950
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,640
the root zone

951
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
actually looks at it very carefully and

952
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,960
make sure

953
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,760
to the extent possible of course

954
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,440
that any such issues are actually

955
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,520
addressed

956
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,480
by

957
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,280
identifying those or such characters as

958
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,960
variant labels

959
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,200
there is also similar work which is

960
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,680
being done for second level

961
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,200
and

962
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,040
registrations

963
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,880
and we continue to work with the

964
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,800
community to address

965
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
proactively address

966
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,119
any potential

967
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,000
problems which could occur and

968
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,400
we would invite you to look at the work

969
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,960
which is being published by icann

970
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,720

to see the rules

974
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,920
and solutions which are being developed

975
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,040
to address

976
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,520
phishing and such security potential

977
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,880
security problems thank you

978
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,280
go ahead

979
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,960

coming meeting in the hague i'd like to

986
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,800
ask you

987
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,839
about the role of national

988
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,160
governments are they

989
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,480
working in collaboration

990
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,440
to support the idm program

991
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,800
or

992
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,359
this is totally

993
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,119
a total work of icon and

994
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,079
international internet community

995
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,920
because i think

996
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,359
national

997
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,710
governments national

998
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,400
[Music]

999
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,920
stakeholders

1000
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,280
could be interested in

1001
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,359
internationalization of the domain names

1002
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,680
and in universal acceptance thank you

1003
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,720
very much

1004
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,640
um thank you andrew

1005
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,960
that's a very good question

1006
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,680
so

1007
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,680
when we've been when we were developing

1008
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,880
these uh

1009
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,960
solutions the root zone level generation

1010
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,839
rule for example

1011
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:46,400
um

1012
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,320
we've uh it was uh basically and uh

1013
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,960
done through a very open process

1014
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,720
where we reached out to the relevant

1015
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,599
communities and in many cases actually

1016
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,880
in most cases they were the local

1017
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,440
country code top-level domains uh in

1018
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,520
many cases also the governments they

1019
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,599
were actually involved in the

1020
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,359
process they were part of the panels

1021
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,280
which we worked with so so they have

1022
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,560
been engaged

1023
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,000
we also have a

1024
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,440
governmental advisory committee a gac

1025
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,880
advisory committee within icann where we

1026
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,280
regularly interact and give them updates

1027
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,480
and they actually

1028
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,280
also have a focused working group on

1029
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,880
internationalized domain names and

1030
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
universal acceptance

1031
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,960
within gag which also

1032
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,560
just meets and

1033
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
can

1034
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,800
provide advice to i can so

1035
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,920
we you know the work so done so far

1036
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,680
we've actually engaged the community

1037
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,880
including

1038
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,880
the public sector

1039
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,200
and they have actually contributed in

1040
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,760
many cases

1041
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,920
moving forward in the case of universal

1042
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,800
acceptance governments actually are

1043
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,760
a very key and important stakeholder

1044
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,359
because

1045
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:06,800
when we talk about updating the

1046
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,560
technology updating the tools we are

1047
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,720
talking about the supply side right the

1048
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,560
technology providers

1049
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,640
but then governments actually come into

1050
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,520
this whole equation on the demand side

1051
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,800
where governments are very large

1052
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,960
i guess consumers or customers of the

1053
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:26,000
technology and if for example

1054
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,319
the governments play a role

1055
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:29,760
in

1056
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,880
asking for support for example of

1057
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,960
domain names and email addresses in the

1058
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,800
languages which are used by their

1059
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,400
citizens that creates the obviously the

1060
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,240
greater demand which can motivate the

1061
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,680
technology to

1062
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,640
uh

1063
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,319
support those scription languages as

1064
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,200
well so we continue to engage with the

1065
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,240
government we would like to of course

1066
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,440
work with more more closely as well

1067
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,960
to

1068
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,920
move forward the universal acceptance of

1069
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,000
domain names and email addresses thank

1070
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000

1071
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,880
