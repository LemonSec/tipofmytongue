2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,440
i'd like to introduce lane wigley

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,519
presenting revisiting power provisioning

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,759
for high bandwidth routers lane is a

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,480
technical marketing engineer at cisco

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,720
and joined us joining us on stage from

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,240
north carolina

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
this is lane's first time presenting at

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,199
anag

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,640
so welcome hey thank you

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,880
around to the end i um

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,240
i hope it's not because your flights got

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,920
cancelled but really appreciate

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,840
everybody here this week um

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,960
if we can go to the first slide here

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
so i've been working with this kind of

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,480
router since about

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,239
98 or so

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,320
and this isn't a pitch from from my

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,399
product but it's just about a project

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,039
that i've been working on uh recently

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
and um i want to kind of start the

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,239
discussion so that at some future nanogs

24
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,480
maybe we can kind of talk about how we

25
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,399
can um find a better way to provision

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,239
power both from the you know what the

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,559
routers are asking for as well as how we

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,879
navigate that in facilities and planning

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,200
for cooling and things like that so what

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,560
are the characteristics of what i'm

31
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,560
calling big routers

32
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,320
they have modular fabrics they have

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
multiple numbers of line cards um lots

34
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,280
of optics options i'll talk about how

35
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,400
that's

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,159
becoming more relevant in the in the

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
range of optics that we have these days

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,040
modular power supplies my system has up

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,520
to 24 power supplies you can put in it

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,040
and the other thing which i know causes

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,680
a lot of challenges is that we often

42
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,360
want the sheet metal for these devices

43
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,000
to be in place for a while two three

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,640
sometimes even four or more generations

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,880
in which their power is going to to go

46
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,399
up

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:44,560
and so for my view on the you know the

48
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,159
vendor side is my understanding of your

49
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,680
challenges is that goal number one is to

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,439
prevent brownouts

51
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,960
we don't want the system running out of

52
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
power obviously

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,719
but often we put in a lot of margin to

54
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,159
keep that from happening and sometimes

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,079
it might be be too much

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
when brownouts happen

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
they're not clean failures some

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,840
transistor runs out of power

59
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,119
but it could be a different one each

60
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,038
time so it's not clear exactly what

61
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,239
happened

62
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,760
the other thing from provisioning is to

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,200
accurately represent cooling

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,400
requirements

65
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
one of the

66
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
common questions i would get from

67
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,599
people i work with they'll say

68
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,360
you know lane you told me i needed 10

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,120
power supplies but it looks like i'm

70
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
only using three why is that and in some

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,560
of the graphics in the next couple

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,560
slides i'm going to kind of explain why

73
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
some of that is just how it is as well

74
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,640
as some of the things we can actually do

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
do better now that we have more and more

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,480
variation as well

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
other things we want to do is minimize

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,280
costs

79
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,280
when i talk to a lot of people

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
inside our company they often think okay

81
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,160
power costs 12 cents per kilowatt hour

82
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,680
or something like that they don't

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,400
understand that in our world we have

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
cooling and pues and um batteries and

85
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,319
all this stuff and so it ends up being a

86
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,959
lot of costs i tend to use in my mind

87
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,120
five thousand dollars per kilowatt or

88
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
sorry per kilowatt per year just based

89
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,040
on what some people have told me they

90
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
pay for protected power from their from

91
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,560
their veterans but it ends up being a

92
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
pretty big number um another thing

93
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,920
that's you know really important is

94
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,319
obviously fitting in the budget

95
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,400
for some of our

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
partners it's about having as many

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,959
servers as they can on the area for

98
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
others it's around um

99
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,120
you know putting in you know putting in

100
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
more network equipment and then the last

101
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
big one which i think is an operational

102
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
challenge that i'd love for us i'll have

103
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,560
some discussion about is this challenge

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,040
about how not to get stranded if i need

105
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,519
10 kilowatts now but i might need 40

106
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,000
kilowatts 10 years from now do i go

107
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,440
ahead and start paying for those 40

108
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,200
kilowatts because what i really don't

109
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,799
want to have happen is to need those 40

110
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,280
kilowatts and it's all gone or is there

111
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,959
some way to have maybe options on the

112
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
power or some system to make these

113
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,959
reservations ahead of time

114
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,200
okay

115
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,560
so there is some level of

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,040
typical versus max power which is just

117
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,040
unavoidable and so here's a system and

118
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,560
i've kind of blocked out my logos just

119
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,959
for a little fun here and this is so

120
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,879
this is one of the ones that i work with

121
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,920
and if you start on the left side with

122
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,200
the green

123
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
those are the line cards and line cards

124
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,440
have some amount of power when they're

125
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,399
just turned on then as you add terabits

126
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,918
per second or billion tackles per second

127
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:23,840
they need more power and those dark

128
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
green are the difference between a

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
typical power and a max power max power

130
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,720
happens when you

131
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,600
put small packets at 100 percent you're

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,479
putting more load on the chip

133
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,240
next to that we have the optics and one

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,160
thing you're seeing increasingly being

135
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
the case with 400 gig is that optics

136
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,199
have a much wider range of power what

137
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
that graphic is showing is on the top

138
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
you have some cards with gray optics for

139
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,199
400 gig then you have some with coherent

140
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,520
zr plus optics and the bottom you have

141
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,000
them with 100 gig optics and so with 100

142
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
gig optics we're really going from three

143
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
and a half up to four watts now we're

144
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,600
going from 12 watts up to 20 plus watts

145
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,960
so there's a huge range of what you

146
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
could put in and even in some systems

147
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,479
you have um uh you know copper cables

148
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,759
on the right side i'm kind of showing

149
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,280
the range of power for the fabric and

150
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
each of these each of these full blocks

151
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,720
is 100 watts just to provide some some

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
scale there the difference between

153
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,840
typical and max on the fabrics are

154
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,560
usually not as much but the fans are

155
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
where things get really interesting

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,560
fan power is a cubic function of how

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,479
much air you're moving so if you're

158
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,960
running a fan at twenty percent that's

159
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,560
dramatic that's not a fifth as much

160
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,759
power as they're running at a hundred

161
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,840
percent so what i'm showing here is the

162
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
little squares on the left side that's

163
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
going to be your typical fan power but

164
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,360
if you need to step on the gas and go to

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,840
100 you could be using 10 times as much

166
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,160
fan power that's kind of unavoidable we

167
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,800
want to have that in reserve in case the

168
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,560
temperature goes up maybe the chips get

169
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
hotter etc but it's sort of unavoidable

170
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,319
there are some things we can do though

171
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,000
and one of the areas that i've been

172
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
focusing on is how we handle optics and

173
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,319
this is for the platform i work on

174
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
again i mentioned that you know if you

175
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,919
go back far enough the optics were just

176
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,919
on board they were part of the card and

177
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,440
we've always just budgeted them as part

178
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,600
of the card even you know relatively

179
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
recently we would just assume that you

180
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,080
had lr4 optics on all the ports and we

181
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,400
would connect that into the system or

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,639
into the line card um but now if you

183
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,080
look at some of the cards i've got i

184
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,440
think one of those is mine one of some

185
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,360
other vendors you know we have maybe 48

186
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
ports on a line card or 36 by 400 gig if

187
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,440
you multiply by 36 by 36 ports by 22

188
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,919
watts for zr plus optic for another two

189
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
watts you need to do some voltage

190
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
conversion there you're very quickly in

191
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
the 800 watts of power just for for

192
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,919
these optics but you might have aoc

193
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,080
cables and copper cables and not need

194
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,599
all of that

195
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,240
so the way i like to illustrate this is

196
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,160
how we can prove our power allocation is

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,680
is kind of two ways

198
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,919
on one hand there's muscle and one hand

199
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,160
there's fat the muscle is stuff that we

200
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
might need like the extra power for the

201
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
line card if we get go 100 percent or

202
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
the extra power in the fabric 100

203
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,680
or the extra power in the fans if we get

204
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,160
a high temperature event we really want

205
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,599
to keep that

206
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,120
available

207
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,919
at the same time there's fat uh we don't

208
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,000
need power for zr plus optics if you're

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,560
running a dac cable and so what we've

210
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,639
done on the platform i work with is

211
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,319
we've actually moved to a model in which

212
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,800
we don't start allocating power for the

213
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,039
modules until you put the net

214
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,400
okay and i don't know if that's what

215
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,520
everybody else does and we're just

216
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,280
catching up or that's some innovation

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,800
that i'm encouraging other people to do

218
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,639
but it's a model that gets us a little

219
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,880
bit closer to reducing the

220
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,919
oversubscription that we uh are you know

221
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,919
that we have been doing traditionally um

222
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,680
there's other things you can do so for

223
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,479
example if you only put four line cards

224
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,479
and the system takes 12 line cards

225
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,240
you're actually gonna if you optimize

226
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,599
have some things shut down on your

227
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
fabric cards you could actually take

228
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,680
care of that transaction dynamically

229
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,280
don't give the line card the fabric

230
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,199
cards full power until the line cards

231
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,560
are put in so you can do some things

232
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,560
like like that as well okay so the goal

233
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,199
is to remove as much fat as we can um

234
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,879
while having the system still still

235
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,560
operate another benefit of doing this in

236
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
addition to uh saving how many power you

237
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,240
know pay your power bill at equinix is

238
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,520
you want to keep your power supplies

239
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,960
efficient and this is just an example

240
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,240
this is probably

241
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
pretty low but a lot of times we don't

242
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
always think of of the efficiency of the

243
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,639
power supplies um the power supplies on

244
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,159
a lot of products today

245
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,240
uh are probably about 96 percent

246
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
efficient from

247
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,880
40

248
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,320
up to 90

249
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
but if you find yourself running your

250
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,000
power supplies at 15 percent of their

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
load they may be just blowing away 15 of

252
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,560
their power just because the voltage

253
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
conversion is not efficient when they're

254
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
used you know so low so having the right

255
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
number of power supplies it helps both

256
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,880
in paying for less power as well as

257
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,720
helps the environment and helps

258
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,399
you know generating less heat from that

259
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,080
efficiency

260
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,680
okay

261
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,200
so other things that we're thinking

262
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
about as far as you know as we we go

263
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,480
forward you know the discussion we could

264
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,240
have is you know how do we treat empty

265
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,000
ports are they just a missing optic or

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,600
they also you know some of the chips

267
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,200
shut down we could even cut that back

268
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
even more um how much margin are the

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
facilities adding um were they

270
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,279
oversubscribing i could talk to somebody

271
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,720
this week and said it's kind of like an

272
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
airplane we sometimes sell a bit more

273
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,320
capacity than we have so we have to

274
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,160
navigate how our system works as well

275
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
and how the facilities work

276
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
what is the optimal max temperature

277
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,399
there's things that we could give you if

278
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,480
the max temperature was 35 there's

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,320
things we could give you if it was was

280
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,600
45

281
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,519
what's the right number

282
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,040
when you think about this there's really

283
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
if you want to minimize total power you

284
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
want to think about

285
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
how much power does the system fans take

286
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,519
how much power does the facility fans

287
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,880
cooling take

288
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,040
how hot are the chips how hot are the

289
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,959
cpus because if the devices actually get

290
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,480
hot they'll start consuming some more

291
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,320
power as well so it's a balancing act

292
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,399
between between all of those

293
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,760
but getting back to how i was saying we

294
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,360
have we tend to stack a lot of margin to

295
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,440
prevent these brownouts what we tend to

296
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,640
do today

297
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
is we have power so that we could lose a

298
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,000
power feed

299
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,160
and have the cooling go down

300
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,279
and get small packets and go 100

301
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,800
all the same time

302
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,959
that might be the right approach that in

303
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
some cases that's that might not be the

304
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,839
right approach in some other places so

305
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,600
we're trying to provide some tools so

306
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
you can make those make those decisions

307
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,959
and then the last thing i think that's

308
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,800
really important to figure out is how

309
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,959
can we figure out some some best

310
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,200
practices to solve this problem of well

311
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
i might need this power in the future

312
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,560
but it'd be really expensive for me to

313
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,000
start paying for it for all now

314
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
and then there's a link to uh some blogs

315
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,480
i've written on on this topic and some

316
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,600
other things

317
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,480
on my site

318
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,000
okay thanks

319
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,809
[Applause]

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,399
any questions

321
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,880
uh stephen wrist networks great

322
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,399
presentation lane

323
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,600
um

324
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,519
i wonder if there's also a tangential

325
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,760
conversation here around

326
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,720
how willing are folks to

327
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,640
embrace kind of different physical form

328
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,800
factor and hardware designs

329
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
that might facilitate lower power

330
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
consumption overall

331
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,240
like a lot of times we have

332
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,600
conversations with customers where

333
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,560
they're like

334
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,160
want to pack as much stuff as possible

335
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
in one ru

336
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,279
right but like if like if we made the

337
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,959
box 3ru

338
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,560
it'd be a lot easier to cool and like

339
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,079
you're you know like you're trading off

340
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,240
one set of things for another but we can

341
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
spin those fans slower we can cool the

342
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
box more efficiently

343
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,760
like there's there's more room for flex

344
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,120
here so

345
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
i i think you know

346
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
speaking as a vendor we'd certainly

347
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,000
solicit uh

348
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,839
you know they're curious as to you know

349
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:57,600
what are the uh trade-offs operators

350
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
might be looking for in the future that

351
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,079
way too

352
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,480
yeah so maybe maybe by show of hands i'm

353
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,880
gonna ask who in general is more are you

354
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,839
constrained versus power constrained

355
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
so who is more are you constrained in

356
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,320
general

357
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,800
okay so i'd see one and a half okay and

358
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,600
who's more power constrained

359
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
okay so a lot more there so so what that

360
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,519
tells me is that maybe it's okay to make

361
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,560
a 2ru tour if the power goes down or

362
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,399
maybe a two ru something and and i was

363
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,240
having a conversation with jared earlier

364
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
the week because by by having bigger

365
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,800
fans uh you can save money on the power

366
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
and the fans also by having bigger heat

367
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,560
sinks you can transform more transform

368
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
more more air through

369
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
so there's lots of things to balance out

370
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,920
but that's that's a great question and

371
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,560
and that's excellent feedback

372
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,119
other questions

373
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,820
okay thanks a lot

374
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,830
[Applause]
