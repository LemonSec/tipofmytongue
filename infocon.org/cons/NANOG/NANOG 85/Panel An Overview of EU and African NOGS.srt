everyone had a nice lunch i mean you're

58
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
all here so i would hope you know uh

59
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,160
what nanog is all about but uh

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,840
just

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
quick uh briefly north america network

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
operators group we're really all about

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,560
community

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,040
as far as you've seen our talks they're

65
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,959
all

66
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,120
vetted by the program committee

67
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
vendor neutral

68
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,280
uh that's how we like to keep things and

69
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,599
then as far as everything else if you

70
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,040
see from like a funding model a lot of

71
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,040
it is sponsorships donations and

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,680
obviously what we get back from uh

73
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,519
registration

74
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
so again based for mainly north america

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,560
and that's about it in a nutshell

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,239
here

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,640
thank you

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,120
so

79
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,760
the dutch network operator group or as i

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,519
tend to call it the smaller sister of

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,800
nanak

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,239
so we also

83
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,040
organize three events a year so we'll

84
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,000
always have some uh the new year strings

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,720
we have a summer event which is

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,280
taking place this year on july 8th and

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,200
you're more than welcome to join it's a

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,360
barbecue we don't have a formal program

89
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,239
but

90
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,720
we give the opportunity for attendees to

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,040
chat with each other and network and

92
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,720
regroup after

93
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
having not seen many in two years um and

94
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,440
we have our traditional anal knock day

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
which is probably

96
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,680
comparable to one of the conference days

97
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,439
at nanak

98
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,760
what we do a bit different is

99
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,680
we don't charge

100
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,439
our attendees

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
so

102
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,080
basically it's free to join we have a

103
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080

that is absolutely welcome

106
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,279
and we don't have members so we

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,320
primarily rely on on many very loyal

108
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,720

109
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520

um

161
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,880
most of the time

this is a non-commercial meeting we

163
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,039
don't like to have commercial

164

presentations sales speeches and things

165
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
like this

166
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,680
we have sponsors like

167
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,000
minutes where they can present stuff but

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,720
that's clearly marked as a sponsors

169
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,560
presentations otherwise

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,680

173
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,280

we form a discussion group and a

190
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560

specific to the sub-region

the links on there

223
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,919
and the profile names

224
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
you can offer runs at least three

225
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
meetings a year and its reason for being

226
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,160
is basically to share network

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,760
engineering and network operations

228
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,040
knowledge

229
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,839
and to assist participants in

230
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,360
building relationships for a better

231
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,279
internet industry

232
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,279
we have a small board of directors

233
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,959
um in the company who support the

234
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
activities of uk naf

235
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
they're supported by three committees

236
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,680
the advisory committee who provide some

237
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,200
oversight

238
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,800
the fairly new communications committee

239
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
who've taken over a lot of the stuff i

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
used to do

241
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,200
such as the blogs and the social media

242
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,040
strategy

243
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,480
and last but not least the program

244
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,200
committee who solicit for and bring in

245
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,720
the content

246
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,080
that

247
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,839
basically is a reason for the meetings

248
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,839
um i'd also like to say that they're all

249
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,839
volunteers

250
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,760
but things have evolved over time

251
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,200
especially

252
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,680
since before covert or bc as i like to

253
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
call it

254
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,360
the way we think about funding that's

255
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
changed um funding models have to

256
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,360
continually evolve

257
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,959
and we're constantly thinking about how

258
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:47,760
to

259
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,519
make it so that it's a bit more

260
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,800
inclusive

261
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,199
as well

262
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,760
the way we communicate

263
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,600
there are new generations coming along

264
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
and we need to think about different

265
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
ways of communicating

266
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,079
the way that we think about diversity

267
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,399
for example and providing a safe space

268
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,200
so

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,760
on the main website you got uk dot uk

270
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,920
respect that will take you to our um

271
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
code of conduct and it's really simple

272
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
really because it's basically be nice to

273
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,720
each other

274
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,320
just respect each other that's all it is

275
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
really that's what it comes down to

276
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,920
um

277
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,240
we want to encourage collaboration um

278
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,399
and have a few ways for people to do

279
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,920
this people in the industry and even if

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,680

we do have a mailing list but what we

285
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,720
find is that

286
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,200
there's much more activity happening on

287

researchers and interesting parts and

345
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,880
companies where those can match exchange

346
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,519
data and all of that we have a running

347
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,440
diversity outreach program where we're

348
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,560
trying to go out and clearly articulate

349
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
that dnoc exists that this is a open

350
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,360
community for everyone to come in and

351
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,680
then we try to solve any problems that

352
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,560
come up um either they're financially or

353
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
mentoring or anything else throughout

354
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
the process

355
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,639
and on top of that we also have just a

356
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,160
normal public outreach where we're

357
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,720
trying to spread the message of knox in

358
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,360
germany but we also have a mission to

359
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,440
spread the message for knox

360
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
internationally globally one of the

361
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,680
reasons why i'm here on top of that we

362
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,000
have a community project fund which

363
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,160
supports hackathons where everyone can

364
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,600
apply to

365
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,920
and if they want to solve and get

366
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,040
together

367
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
issues that the internet and the

368
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,720
networking community has we have an open

369
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,040
fund that people can apply to get money

370
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
out of that

371
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,360
quickly talking about meetings we

372
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,519
obviously have a yearly conference that

373
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,079
is completely hybrid and remote but a

374
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,760
couple of years ago we started thinking

375
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,320
about okay how do we get new generations

376
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,720
how do we get new people how do we get

377
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,880
other people out of the landscape into

378
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,040
the community and the way that we

379
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,720
established and it's been pretty

380
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,560
successful so far

381
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,240
has been that we clearly said we need to

382
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,160
go out and spread the message so we have

383
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,240
outreach and then we wanted to make it

384
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
as easy as possible for everyone to be

385
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,480
engaged in the community and to

386
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,480
understand and have a first step into

387
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,519
dinner that's why we created the meetups

388
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,360
which are spread around the whole

389
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,560
country

390
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,240
so that you don't have to pay for

391
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,839
tickets you don't have to pay for travel

392
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,519
you don't have to pay for hotels you can

393
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,680
just go have a nice evening see one two

394
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,000
three talks enjoy people and understand

395
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,120
what it is you can even do that hybrid

396
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,920
and we our hope and our success story

397
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,160
out of that has been people then clearly

398
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,320
or a portion of that clearly comes to

399
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,560
the main conferences attends our worship

400
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,959
days gets more involved understands

401
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,000
people see

402
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,519
see people from the international

403
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,399
landscape

404
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,160
and then they even partially go to the

405
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,560
international conferences so that's

406
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,160
roughly what we're doing

407
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,320
um we obviously have a yearly conference

408
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,639

409
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,279

um yeah thank you for slides uh i would

423
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,480
like to tell the story about the enoch

424
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,639
so first of all i used to be a program

425
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,920
committee chair uh uh in the years

426
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,399
2015-2018

427
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,519
and ipc members since 2010 until 2018.

428
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,800
so now i'm

429
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,360
not anymore a program committee member

430
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,160
i'm just an observer so let's move first

431
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,040
to the history

432
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,079
uh the eurasian network operators group

433
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,199
was formed in 2010 as a result of

434
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,800
several representative regional meetings

435
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,040
um

436
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,240
mostly

437
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
held in moscow so the idea was to

438
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
combine the classic network operators

439
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,199
group

440
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,519
with

441
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,000
original meetings bringing there are

442
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,399
some content from the ripe meetings

443
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,560
and then with the help of ripeness we

444
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,800
chose the name enoch

445
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,360
so in the year

446
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,000
2010 it was only the mining list with

447
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,160
discussions and

448
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,399
ripened his original meeting in 2011

449
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,240
with the help of rypncc there was a

450
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,839
first linog meeting

451
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,160
where we have got a lot of the local

452
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,880
audience from the domain people

453
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,199
from the tld

454
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,360
operations and

455
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
internet exchange members

456
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,800
the program committee uh responsible for

457
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,160
the program

458
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,680
of the meeting was formed from the

459
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,079
volunteering people mostly from the ripe

460
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,679
ncc service region

461
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,199
and then

462
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,240
we organized

463
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,240
15 more in-person meetings in the region

464
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,079
the meetings were completely different

465
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,959
in terms of the number of attendees

466
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:19,760
uh

467
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,280
well then an amount where was

468
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,880
100 to 500 member participants

469
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,000
and later

470
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,960
in the year and after the covert

471
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,200
outbreak the two meetings were virtual

472
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,840
we have had a nice telegram chat with

473
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,160
about 600

474
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,480
subscribers this year

475
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,039
so the interesting thing that is that we

476
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,080
never have collected a member entrance

477
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,960
fee

478
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,559
from the attendees everything was

479
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,039
covered by the sponsors and by the ripen

480
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,960
cc as a meeting organizer

481
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,320
so the goal of this group was to find a

482
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,720
common sync between operators in the

483
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,400
different regions

484
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,640
and then we wanted to mix the local

485
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,360
content with the rapid cc meeting with

486
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,440
the write meetings with some content

487
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,400
from ietf meetings from icann meetings

488
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,360
and presenting to our local audience in

489
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,280
our region

490
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,160
also

491
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,799
a lot of people were happy with the

492
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,960
technical trainings which we have as a

493
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,799
part of our meetings as well so we used

494
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
both english and russian language during

495
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,679
the meetings and trainings

496
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,840
and we had

497
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,000
a simultaneous translation

498
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
so after this we were trying to

499
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,880
encourage

500
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,360
people uh from the local community to

501
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,919
participate in different groups

502
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,320
across the globe

503
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,559
so

504
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:53,600
excuse me

505
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,880
at the end of

506
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,919
2021 we had a program committee consists

507
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,679
of 18 people

508
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,360
and they were preparing the meeting in

509
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,200
june but then

510
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,480
a war started

511
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,640
in february and

512
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,640
russian federation invaded ukraine

513
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,080
and

514
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,240
what i would like to say is that before

515
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,559
even before the war started we had a

516
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,400
strange conversation

517
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,799
in our chat so i put

518
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,480
some statements to the slide

519
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
in the community we have had an

520
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,720
operators discussion completely

521
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,120
different things while ukrainian for

522
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,039
example operators were discussing

523
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,480
the right things the database issues

524
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,559
operators from russia were usually

525
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,120
interested in compliance with the local

526
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,960
regulations

527
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
but then the war changed everything

528
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,360
so very soon after the war started the

529
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,200
program committee chair resigned it and

530
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,360
he also

531
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,400
requested ripened cc to disband the

532
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,919
whole enoch group uh and stop spending

533
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
resources to organize a meeting

534
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
he also offered that the local

535
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,559
communities

536
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,760
in the region will have to organize a

537
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,480
noc within

538
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,720
each country

539
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,039
and then

540
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,200
ripen say she decided to postpone the

541
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,640
meeting in moscow in june

542
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
the interesting thing is that

543
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,559
the community almost didn't object

544
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:34,640
against the proposal of disbanding the

545
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,919
group

546
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,240
only one pc member disagreed he sent his

547
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,840
private opinion to the mailing list

548
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,960
so what we have got from

549
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,559
the story we are still uncertain whether

550
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,559
we understand our goals

551
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,080
correctly and we understand our audience

552
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,400
we are still unshortened that building a

553
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,120
language based community across the

554
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,400
region

555
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,559
is the right way and finally we are

556
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,440
still uncertain whether there is

557
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,159
actually a community in the region or

558
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,880
our community was kind of artificially

559
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
created

560
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,480
i believe that if there will be a

561
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,799
meeting participation fee introduced

562
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,559
then the number of attendees will be

563
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,000
less than half

564
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,320
of the registrant coming to the meeting

565
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,559
for free

566
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,200
and by the way making a smile make a

567
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,520
side note uh

568
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,440
we have organized another language based

569
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,760
community in our region

570
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
where i live we call it uh czech and

571
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,400
slovak network operators group and we

572
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,840
still think we can grow a local

573
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,400
community good enough to run a local

574
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,520
meetings

575
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,000
and this knock is also

576
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,520
supported by the

577
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,760
national domain registry by internet

578
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,960
exchange point and by academic network

579
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,840
in czech republic

580
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,039
then another things

581
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,919
what we also get as a result the

582
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,039
meeting in moscow is postponed

583
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,520
by the organizer the ripency is still

584
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,000
observing the situation without making

585
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,799
any final decision

586
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,520
the telegram chat the most efficient way

587
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,360
to communicate is deleted and the

588
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,880
mailing list is empty for years

589
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,640
because there is no activity at all

590
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,720
then the local hosting conferences are

591
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,400
ongoing in several countries across the

592
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,640
region there are many interesting

593
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,840
topics being discussed like

594
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,640
isp uh operations or hosting or devops

595
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,480
or even the human rights and the

596
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,440
internet

597
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,400
but all of them of those conferences are

598
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,200
not even close to a network operators

599
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,440
group

600
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,679
and that's it for me

601
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,600
thank you sergey

602
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,480
um

603
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,640
do we have any questions at this point

604
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,400
from the floor

605
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,960
please come to the mic

606
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,840
hello my name is andrei shirbovich i am

607
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,760
from mcgill university in montreal

608
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
canada

609
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
i'd like to ask you why the community

610
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,679
should be language based

611
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,559
that was one of the idea uh

612
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,600
when

613
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,320
the

614
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,240
founders of enoch

615
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,480
were encouraging

616
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,200
the ripeness management to

617
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,840
help us to build this community so we're

618
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,200
trying to build a russian-based

619
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,000
uh community in in different countries

620
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,600
mostly x years so

621
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,799
thank you very much

622
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,400
do we have questions for anyone else

623
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,679
josh oakes from telstra

624
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,919
not as much a question but just

625
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,039
to the point of whether nogs should be

626
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,080
language-based geography-based or

627
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,039
whatever organizing characteristic

628
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:11,440
ultimately i mean all of us are here

629
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,520
supporting each other

630
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,840
we build networks networks are means for

631
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,120
communication and connection and so even

632
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,559
with the

633
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,919
strife that you're dealing with in my

634
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,960
heart truly goes out to you in this

635
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,919
crazy time for you

636
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,760
don't give up on that ideal that

637
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,279
ultimately

638
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,039
we're all trying to connect

639
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:34,400
whether it's

640
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,240
in our countries with other countries

641
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,080
with each other

642
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,919
whether that is

643
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,960
regional or language or cultural

644
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,559
don't give up on the dream of keeping

645
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,600
everybody connected

646
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,400
thank you

647
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,719
[Applause]

648
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,559
and

649
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,240
we have a question from the chat

650
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,840
natalie treniman asks a question for all

651
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
on the panel

652
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,120
uh what platform do you use for today

653
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,120
for day-to-day communication and why

654
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,559
so

655
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,480
no cure you might know natalie be able

656
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,720
to answer

657
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,240
good question

658
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,279
um so

659
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,039
we're still kind of old school um we use

660
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,120
irc still

661
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,919
an

662
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,240
email so we have a mailing list

663
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,080
but as the nest shed as well we are

664
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,000
looking into

665
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
newer ways of communication i think you

666
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,840
said it right

667
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,200
because obviously we see that

668
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,559
let's say the the

669
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,400
the the part of our community that's

670
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
been around a little bit longer they are

671
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,360
on irc but

672
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,200
it's hard to get new folks obviously on

673
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,360
irc so um so we're looking into um

674
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,360
what platforms we we should be using

675
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,240
going forward um so i'm i'm i'm very

676
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
interested hearing what what what others

677
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,080
are using and as we can learn from that

678
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
i mean within nanog we're fairly heavy

679
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,480
slack users along with all the other

680
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,400
stuff but in terms of chat right

681
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,840
well

682
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,520
we are using mostly

683
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,480
mail

684
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
mailing list

685
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,559
and

686
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,039
part of the community is organized

687
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,400
in irc some people is on telegram so

688
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,120
yeah i'm also looking forward to to this

689
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,080
discussion of modernizing a little bit

690
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,919
the communication between

691
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,080
between the members and

692
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,120
what what we should use

693
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,279
patrick yep we're we're halfway there uh

694
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,120
we've had the same issue we're mailing

695
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,880
list and irc and we've had a

696
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,200
long-standing discussion about whether

697
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,039
that is the future and we can get people

698
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,559
on it or not

699
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:52,640
what we settled on now is we're going

700
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,039
the direction of a matrix server which

701
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,039
is going to integrate the telegram

702
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,080
telegrams the rcs and and then we have

703
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,440
to figure out how we can actually get

704
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
the mailing list into that to some

705
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,000
extent but uh there is clearly a mission

706
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,159
for all of us to to go out and figure

707
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,679
out how we can integrate the new

708
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,440
communication ways for everyone while

709
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,760
not separating the communities into five

710
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,640
places so that we don't have the benefit

711
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,640
like that was the hardest one for us is

712
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,039
like we wanted to have a consistent

713
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,840
place where people talk to each other

714
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,960
for sure

715
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,480
um well we still use a mailing list um

716
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,080
you know it's very old school but

717
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,320
currently that's what we're using and

718
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,880
we're looking forward to

719
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,120
having a telegram group to start that

720
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,720
would be helpful but

721
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,039
i'm also looking forward to hearing from

722
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,480
others and take away from them as well

723
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,320
sergey

724
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,399
in the past in the past the most

725
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,080
effective way for

726
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,559
our group was a telegram chat

727
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:53,520
and

728
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,080
i i'm observing let's say other

729
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,760
groups they are

730
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,440
also very active on the telegram

731
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,640
so the

732
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,080
kind of chat could be very effective for

733
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,559
for knox but of course you

734
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,440
if you are running a knock probably

735
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,200
you need to keep the mailing list at

736
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,360
least

737
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,679
you might have some knowledge on this

738
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:20,480
um

739
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,039
well we still have the mailing list um

740
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,279
and but what we found is since we

741
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,120
introduced matamos

742
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
as the chat server

743
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,279
with different channels um

744
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,440
most of the daily chats have moved on to

745
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
that because it's instant collaboration

746
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
uh for everyone we we do still say to

747
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,600
people that if you do want to have a

748
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,919
record of things then

749
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,880
and then use the mailing list but still

750
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,240
we're finding that

751
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,520
basically the mailing list traffic has

752
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,080
fallen quite a lot um i'm not saying

753
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,720
that matamos is the be-all end-all we

754
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,880
use it internally as well as well as for

755
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,520
the community but

756
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,320
it it's it's a journey uh as i mentioned

757
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,600
uh we're going through a period of

758
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,720
evolution

759
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,799
and i think with with all nogs there is

760
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
a constant period of evolution anyway um

761
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,520
and we need to be

762
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,399
um we need to be aware of how the

763
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,159
younger generation's new entrance into

764
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,760
the community

765
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,320
like to work um so

766
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,799
it's basically matamost is our journey

767
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,919
on wherever we end up with newer board

768
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,000
members newer pc members coming in who

769
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,520
will advise on what to do next

770
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,480
i've i've i have a question so with my

771
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,320
right program committee vice chair head

772
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,760
on

773
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,600
we are using matter most for the for the

774
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,320
program committee communication

775
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
at the ripe meetings and the

776
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,399
communication with drip ncc like behind

777
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,679
the curtains

778
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,000
and that works quite well but i'm now

779
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,960
wondering you try to beat the nog

780
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,279
members because i i'm wondering how this

781
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,039
works with with the bigger group it

782
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,880
works quite well with the smaller group

783
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,240
how does it work with the with the

784
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,880
bigger group so we we we have different

785
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,120
channels it's a bit like slack really

786
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,720
and we have different channels so one of

787
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,960
the things that we've done with um the

788
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,760
um

789
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,919
the the discussions during the meetings

790
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,000
is basically called the uk north channel

791
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,919
is that we have a bridge to irc because

792
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,600
those who are a little bit more ultimate

793
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,919
and don't want to move on to matamos can

794
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:22,799
still

795
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,039
collaborate and discuss that way

796
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,480
most of the activity actually happens

797
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,080
around the meetings anyway

798
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,600
and then we've got other channels which

799
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,760
are for general chat or anything that's

800
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,000
a bit more technical but yeah it seems

801
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,600
to work um

802
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,840
we found that um the activity has

803
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,960
increased

804
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,799
quite well

805
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,440
cool so we need to try i mean we're

806
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,760
wearing other hats at euro ix and log

807
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,039
phi

808
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,320
we use matamos for internal and again

809
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,679
for events

810
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,679
people join the channel for

811
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,000
the two or three days and then we don't

812
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,760
see them again until next year or next

813
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,279
six months time

814
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,840
so along those lines internally mostly

815
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
it is slack that we use for real-time

816
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,320
communication as well as for email but

817
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,760
from the community i've heard mailing

818
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,320
lists i think we probably will never get

819
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,840
rid of those just

820
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,919
because but we've transitioned a lot of

821
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,559
that into like discourse to kind of

822
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,039
modernize that platform and then i think

823
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,200
uh everyone who's joined either

824
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,679
virtually or even in the room we have an

825
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,080
inbuilt chat function that's archived

826
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,199
within every live meeting

827
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,960
it just i think i've said it but i i

828
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,720
think that was a constant of our

829
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,679
communication here is like the key value

830
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,640
that i always get at feedback for the

831
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,279
old irc is whenever the internet breaks

832
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,200
down somewhere in germany you can find

833
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,960
all the people that discuss how to

834
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,600
actually fix it in the irc and that's

835
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,840
the core value of it we we need to be

836
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,159
careful that we migrate that somewhat

837
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,880
how and keep it alive

838
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,399
we're finding that newer entrants into

839
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,960
the industry don't want to get onto irc

840
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,000
so how do we encourage participation and

841
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,919
those new entrants to become the people

842
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,039
who run the internet um and so this is a

843
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:14,240
constant battle that we've had in the

844
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,960
past in that if we keep to irc and we

845
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,559
say to people actually you've got to

846
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,000
join this and you've got to do this if

847
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,679
you want to be part of the group the

848
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,080
part of the clique then we're not going

849
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,840
to get those new entrants

850
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,200
coming in and we're not going to be

851
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,039
replaced and we're going to die off

852
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,559
basically and what happens to the net

853
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,600
then so i think it i do agree it's a

854
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,919
constant battle but we have to be wary

855
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,679
of actually what are we doing here

856
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,159
because if i look back at if i look back

857
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,559
at when i joined the industry um you

858
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:43,840
know i was part of the group where

859
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,919
actually the telcos are old

860
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,519
they do things in particular ways we're

861
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,799
much more dynamic we're going to

862
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,600
introduce our own tools our new tools

863
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,360
but what we're finding is that as an

864
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
industry we're doing the same thing as

865
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,159
of as 25 30 years ago and why are we

866
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,960
doing that why we got stuck in this

867
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,799
circular thing of actually we expect

868
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,720
others to do this why aren't we looking

869
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,039
at the way that younger people are

870
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,559
wanting to collaborate

871
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,480
i think we're agreeing like always

872
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,480
ninety percent yes um i think you're

873
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,640
that's what i said it's like um the the

874
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,640
direction you're going with mata morris

875
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,880
in in the integration of irc that's

876
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,960
absolutely the direction we need to go

877
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,880
and we need to bring all younger people

878
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,399
in but we need to make sure that we keep

879
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,720
the other ones as well

880
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,760
yeah i mean my cycle club in boston has

881
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,600
so many different channels for ways you

882
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,519
can reach they do way more than any of

883
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,120
the logs i'm involved with you know

884
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,640
there are multiple ways you're from

885
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,799
facebook upwards or downwards depending

886
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,120
where you think facebook is

887
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,919
so

888
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,200
i hope that answers your question

889
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,600
natalie um we've got a question in from

890
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,399
matt ptac but i think that's actually a

891
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,480
confusion matt's asking about

892
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,799
simultaneous translation and you're not

893
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,480
doing simultaneous translation you're

894
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,640
doing simultaneous interpretation

895
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,039
correct

896
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,000
interpretations for women yes yeah okay

897
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
so matt if you do actually mean

898
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,159
translations i don't think anyone does

899
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,800
simultaneous translation of meetings um

900
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,320
we do a lot of interpretation of

901
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,879
meetings but not translations two

902
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,440
completely different problem spaces

903
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,960
interpretation is just done with real

904
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,280
life interpreters

905
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,199
so any more questions from the floor

906
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,839
before we move on

907
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,879
great

908
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:29,119
so what did we all do during the covid

909
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,560
times

910
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,839
and how did we keep functioning

911
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,359
financially yeah

912
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:36,960
stayed at home

913
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,889
i meant the no

914
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,760
[Laughter]

915
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,839
the knock stayed at home

916
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,480
we actually hibernated to be honest

917
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,918
because

918
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,399
we had a long chat at the at the board

919
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,239
um and uh

920
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,480
we thought that uh

921
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,560
nothing can replace the in-person

922
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,359
meetings nothing can replace

923
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,119
uh people talking to each other

924
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,400
face-to-face

925
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,280
and there was gazillion of

926
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
online meetings uh uh that

927
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,599
um

928
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:08,880
just

929
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:11,520
not fitting the purpose of of an old

930
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,599
noggis people talking to other people

931
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,880
sharing experience and um

932
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,240
also

933
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
from from

934
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,000
i can i can speak at

935
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,839
with different hats on if if you want me

936
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,800
for synagogue we we did this decision

937
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,280
uh i'm also the chair of the sc

938
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
southeastern europe regional meeting

939
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,640
we were postponing the sae meeting for a

940
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
long time and then and then we decided

941
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,880
okay let's have an online meeting like

942
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,720
like couple of hours

943
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,760
um

944
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,960
on

945
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,160
on the ripe

946
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,320
and see on the ripe

947
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,160
community meetings we had

948
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,560
constant online meetings like

949
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,160
replacement for in-person meetings uh so

950
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,000
but also as

951
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,880
as a global nog alliance founding member

952
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,160
we saw that

953
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,079
uh the the

954
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:04,960
request for help from from the nogs

955
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,000
around the world uh declined a little

956
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,640
bit during the covet times uh because

957
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,760
there were no

958
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,320
in-person meetings but what they asked

959
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,200
us is for the zoom license so nogs could

960
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,640
have online meetings um over over our uh

961
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,160
zoom license so

962
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,240
it's very different it's from the

963
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,720
community to community it's it's it's

964
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,640
really

965
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,920
you know it's

966
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,040
it it's a decision

967
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,599
okay

968
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,440
yeah so we did organize events during um

969
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,720
kovit uh obviously all virtual so we

970
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,960
changed uh the concept a little bit as

971
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,359
for example with the new year strings

972
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,280
instead of gathering together in in a

973
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
bar or

974
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,760
we offered a online beer tasting

975
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,960
so participants got shipped home i think

976
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,480
it was three different kinds of beers

977
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,560
and and we invited someone who is

978
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,599
actually an expert in in in sorry sorry

979
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,880
sorry

980
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,040
you

981
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,359
we only shipped in the netherlands there

982
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,079
was and obviously we normally see quite

983
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,640
a few attendees from u.s and other

984
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,079
places as well so

985
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,680
we had to adjust to that

986
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,480
um and and we did organize our yearly

987
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,400
analog day however uh as indeed

988
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680
john said

989
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,920
everyone was already

990
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,000
pretty much done with a more zoom

991
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,240
meeting so we shortened the program but

992
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,760
we figured we did want to organize

993
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,240
something on one hand because we

994
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,079
obviously made promises to our sponsors

995
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,599
but on the other hand

996
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,160
and there's always knowledge to share

997
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,760
so

998
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,720
so instead of a full day of

999
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,480
presentations we brought it back to a

1000
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,560
couple of hours of presentations

1001
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,359
and and and that that was received quite

1002
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,440
well i mean it's

1003
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
absolutely great that we can meet in

1004
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
person again but um

1005
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,520
it was good to

1006
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,720
meet up virtually as well there's

1007
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,560
obviously platforms that can help you

1008
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,040
with that we use gather time for example

1009
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,640
it's it's a sort of a virtual

1010
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,400
environment where you can walk around

1011
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,720
with your character and and stand next

1012
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,000
to each other and then the video will

1013
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,839
appear and you can chat with each other

1014
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,440
obviously it's not a replacement for the

1015
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,240
hallway conversations here but it it

1016
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,480
sort of comes close so um

1017
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,720
we figured we should be creative and and

1018
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,000
still try to bring the community

1019
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,280
together

1020
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,119
and the sponsors were happy

1021
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,200
oh yeah absolutely yeah um as a matter

1022
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,280
of fact we we even attracted a couple of

1023
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,920
new sponsors during govit and so we're

1024
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,839
very happy with that and and and we

1025
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,440
hadn't had a single complaint from a

1026
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,720
sponsor

1027
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,320
uh about us not organizing uh in-person

1028
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,119
events everyone understood very much

1029
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,160
support from from sponsors yeah

1030
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,520
i mean the other thing to remember of

1031
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,040
course in europe is that individual

1032
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,040
countries opened up at completely

1033
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,359
different times and places so you didn't

1034
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,359
have a constant

1035
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,960
everything's open everything is closed

1036
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,240
it's a bit is here and bit isn't there

1037
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,000
patrick

1038
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,160
it was interesting i gotta admit i'm not

1039
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,400
a fan of virtual meetings i

1040
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,040
like traveling i like meeting people

1041
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,640
and i think we got to be honest you

1042
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,720
can't replace that with hybrid or

1043
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,240
virtual meetings

1044
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,720
um but it also gave us a push in two

1045
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,960
directions and and that was fascinating

1046
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,480
to see because it came together it's

1047
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,599
like one we complete before we

1048
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,920
outsourced the av of the conference

1049
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,760
completely and we changed that it's like

1050
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,079
we're we now have all the equipment we

1051
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,880
run it with our own people by ourselves

1052
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,720
with volunteers

1053
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,800
um so that's amazing and that actually

1054
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,359
gave us significant improvement

1055
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,520
um and the other part was the actual

1056
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,480
hybrid experience before it was like

1057
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,720
yeah we had that on youtube or somewhere

1058
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,119
and you can watch it if you really want

1059
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,160
to why ever you wanted to do that now we

1060
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,079
had half a year to focus on how can you

1061
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,480
make the experience as good as possible

1062
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,280
remote and i think that's gonna stay so

1063
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,599
that was awesome it's good

1064
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,960
besides i like meeting people again so

1065
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,920
let's keep wolves

1066
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,160
porsche

1067
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,359
so um

1068
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,680
with us when the news came when the news

1069
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,560
broke with the pandemic

1070
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,000
we thought it was going to blow over in

1071
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,359
a couple of months

1072
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,280
our conference is was going to be in

1073
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,520
september 2020 and we thought oh it's

1074
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,119
going to blow over in a couple of months

1075
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,680
let's wait it out by march

1076
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,760
when the lockdowns were implemented we

1077
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,960
decided

1078
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,040
no ways we need to defer the conference

1079
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,240
to next year so we deferred to 2021

1080
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,560
and we were not going to do we decided

1081
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,079
we were not going to do a virtual event

1082
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,280
because

1083
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,640
there were so many other events that

1084
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,119
were happening online and people had to

1085
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,640
interact online all the time and we

1086
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,880
thought people will just be tired zoom

1087
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,839
fatigue was already happening

1088
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:56,720
but

1089
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,880
by september

1090
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,520
we realized that the community still

1091
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,839
needed a platform to talk about what's

1092
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:04,960
going on

1093
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,800
i mean

1094
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,960
everybody was basically now relying on

1095
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,319
the internet

1096
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,240
and we thought let's get a couple of

1097
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
people together we put together a panel

1098
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,359
of

1099
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,680
isps from different countries within the

1100
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,400
region to come and talk about the impact

1101
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,280
um

1102
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,680
on their services and uh and their

1103
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,920
offerings to um to the community and

1104
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,440
last year we decided to be actually

1105
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,839
going to do a shorter version of a

1106
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,240
conference two-day conference and so we

1107
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,720
held a two-day conference 90 minutes

1108
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,160
each and it worked out so moving forward

1109
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,319
we obviously want to have in-person

1110
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,960
meetings but we will definitely consider

1111
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,520
still having the online version for

1112
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,599
those that can't travel but definitely

1113
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:52,079
in person

1114
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,200
and the finances and the finances well

1115
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,800
um so for for the one we had in 2020 we

1116
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,599
only requested a sponsorship for the

1117
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,079
online platform which was zoom

1118
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,720
and last year we decided to

1119
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,839
actually

1120
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,599
invite sponsors to

1121
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,760
to to offer sponsorship so that when we

1122
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,839
do start up again with physical meetings

1123
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,800
we can at least have something to

1124
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,079
to put on as a deposit for venues etc

1125
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,040
but also we were able to establish our

1126
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,200
own

1127
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,440
platforms for the meeting and that

1128
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,079
definitely helped

1129
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,240
for the next time you need a zoom

1130
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,800
license we can we can offer you the

1131
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,640
global log alliance we have a zoom

1132
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,200
license just to help knocks with with

1133
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,319
the meetings thank you

1134
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,040
well you said during covid i think we

1135
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,480
are still within coveted times so well

1136
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,079
if you believe the british government i

1137
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,920
think you'll find it very much

1138
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,200
something i don't visit because i don't

1139
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,960
believe them but but what i was going to

1140
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,359
say was that we're still learning um and

1141
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,280
we're still going through a learning

1142
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,440
experience of how best to do things we

1143
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,960
haven't quite got there yet you know

1144
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,440
i've said in earlier on that we're going

1145
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,200
we're on this journey and that journey

1146
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,960
hasn't finished yet where we end up we

1147
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,760
still

1148
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,119
really don't know

1149
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:16,640
but um

1150
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,440
when

1151
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,040
when the when the restrictions were

1152
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,520
first announced and we had to go into

1153
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,599
lockdowns

1154
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,079
in march um we were actually very very

1155
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,440
close to

1156
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,280
our physical meeting our next meeting

1157
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,040
which was in april

1158
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,640
um and

1159
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,000
there was a lot of work to be done with

1160
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,680
the venue because the venue didn't

1161
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,880
believe that they would have to go into

1162
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,800
lockdown and there was a lot of contract

1163
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,400
negotiation to go on

1164
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,760
um

1165
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,920
thankfully they they agreed i we were

1166
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,280
apparently the first people to talk to

1167
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,160
them about covid and having to postpone

1168
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,319
um so that was quite an experience going

1169
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,440
through all of that

1170
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,319
um

1171
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,640
at the same time we were aware that

1172
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,839
actually we didn't know how long it

1173
00:43:55,839 --> 00:43:57,119
would take we thought it may be about

1174
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,480
three maybe four months of course we

1175
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,040
were wrong about that um but we wanted

1176
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:04,240
to do something in the interim anyway um

1177
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,400
because we wanted to keep the um the

1178
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,319
momentum going we wanted to keep the

1179
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,800
collaboration going we already had a

1180
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,319
bunch of presentations that were already

1181
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,280
accepted for april um and so we did an

1182
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,240
online only thing in in may and that was

1183
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,599
our first one i think we were probably

1184
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,520
the first people to do an online meeting

1185
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,440
apart from links who did one before or

1186
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:24,880
just before us

1187
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,319
um

1188
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,280
that was that was interesting um because

1189
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,280
um the first time we did it there was a

1190
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
lot of preparation to do what technology

1191
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,480
do we use

1192
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,720
um and we just went with zoom

1193
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,480
um and thinking this is the best way to

1194
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,880
do it um it showed us that there was a

1195
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,960
lot more involved because of course you

1196
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,160
have your physical meetings there are

1197
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,960
people here with you

1198
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,640
at the venue on site and you're all

1199
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,400
working together but

1200
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,560
working remotely on a

1201
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,440
uh on an online meeting

1202
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,920
um with everyone being remote not only

1203
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:59,280
the people who are running it but also

1204
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,040
the speakers and what about the

1205
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,880
technology they're using so there's a

1206
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,480
whole lot of things that we had to think

1207
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,359
about so we used covert times with

1208
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,920
online meetings as a learning experience

1209
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,160
and making each one better learning from

1210
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
the last one to implement changes in the

1211
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,319
next one and so we got to the point

1212
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,160
where actually we run them a bit more

1213
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,920
like tv shows where we have a run of

1214
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,400
show and the run of show runs to 20

1215
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
pages long for example

1216
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,680
um

1217
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,839
where everyone knows the speakers

1218
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:28,880
everyone who's involved in the

1219
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,040
operations the av people they know

1220
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,200
exactly what's happening at what time

1221
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,720
where the links are the social media

1222
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,880
team knows what to post where to post

1223
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,040
what the tags are so

1224
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,240
um and

1225
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,400
that's how we've done it um

1226
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,160
what we became aware of was zoom fatigue

1227
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,240
as you mentioned zoom fatigue was a big

1228
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,400
thing um we saw that there was wider

1229
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,920
participation

1230
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,880
from many other countries um but we were

1231
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,720
aware of this zoom fatigue and i felt it

1232
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:55,760
myself

1233
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,560
um

1234
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,160
and so we were prepared for lower

1235
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,640
numbers and those numbers did fall

1236
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,560
because people stopped registering for

1237
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,240
every single thing they could because

1238
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,480
they had livestreamed as well

1239
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,480
and with that in mind we decided to

1240
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,960
initially keep the online meetings to

1241
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,520
just a couple of hours on one day

1242
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,119
and over time we increase the time a

1243
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:17,920
little bit until our last two meetings

1244
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,800
they were hybrid ones um again another

1245
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,240
learning experience because we'd never

1246
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,000
run hybrids before in the way that we

1247
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,720
wanted to um of course we did

1248
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,960
web streaming live web streaming of all

1249
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:31,280
our meetings but what we found was that

1250
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,720
we wanted to keep the collaboration

1251
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,119
going we wanted the interactivity that

1252
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,440
online participants had

1253
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,599
and so having the online stuff having

1254
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:41,040
the hybrid meetings allowed us to do

1255
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,960
that but of course again you've got some

1256
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,240
speakers who are in the room some

1257
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,680
speakers will remote you've got some of

1258
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,880
the crew who are in the room some of the

1259
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,240
crew who are remote

1260
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,200
um so again a learning experience i'm

1261
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,280
not sure where the end goal is yet but

1262
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,480
we're getting there

1263
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,040
as to finances i have to say it's been

1264
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,000
tough

1265
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,079
very very tough because

1266
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:03,520
uh we did we decided not to charge for

1267
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,760
online only things online online-only

1268
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,240
meetings um which meant that we

1269
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,160
um through our reserves um two years

1270
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,079
worth of reserves we get through very

1271
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,280
very quickly

1272
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,760
um on top of that sponsors we found in

1273
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,680
the uk weren't willing to sponsor things

1274
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,280
because they were like oh no we're much

1275
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,720
more interested in

1276
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,920
uh we're much more interested in

1277
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,119
physical meetings where we can actually

1278
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,480
meet with people

1279
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,280
um

1280
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,680
but that changed once once um the

1281
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,440
restrictions continued for many many

1282
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,280
more months we had sponsors coming and

1283
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,040
saying look we would like to sponsor

1284
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,720
we'd like to sponsor something it wasn't

1285
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,160
at the higher levels that they were

1286
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,839
doing in the past but it's something

1287
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,040
that helped us

1288
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,000
but yeah

1289
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,920
the finance side was tough and so

1290
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,599
as i said earlier it

1291
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,680
covert made us rethink how we do our

1292
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,078
funding

1293
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,440
any comment sergey or just

1294
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,440
the story from earlier well um

1295
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,920
just just my personal impressions from

1296
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,760
from this time you know um

1297
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,400
uh organizing a meeting during the time

1298
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,760
makes me a put me in a terrible mood

1299
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,559
so

1300
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:11,680
you are accepting the requests uh from

1301
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:12,720
from the

1302
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,000
i mean the talk proposals from the

1303
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:14,960
people

1304
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,599
you probably never never have seen you

1305
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,800
will probably never never will see here

1306
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,200
those people in in the real life

1307
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,400
and

1308
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,000
you are presented

1309
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,160
to uh you are you are protested to the

1310
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,200
audience

1311
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,680
that you you is also everything is very

1312
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,119
virtual

1313
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,960
so this makes me completely

1314
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,559
sick of this and i try to run away from

1315
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,200
organizing

1316
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,839
anything

1317
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,200
yeah actually

1318
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,240
so as nanak we have three annual uh

1319
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,920
three meetings every year

1320
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,000
uh when everything started happening we

1321
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,800
were right at the end of nanook 78 in

1322
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,160
san francisco and then everything

1323
00:48:58,160 --> 00:48:59,280
started to

1324
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,280
change

1325
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,079
we were our next meeting was in june

1326
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,480
and as everyone thought this may be only

1327
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,119
a couple months let's try to see if we

1328
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,040
we can really have this still

1329
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,720
and it was really kind of nerve-wracking

1330
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,960
because like many of you we've had

1331
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,559
speakers lined up what are we going to

1332
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,359
do

1333
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,920
and then all like in europe where

1334
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,359
different states had their own different

1335
00:49:21,359 --> 00:49:23,839
policies different opening times

1336
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,040
we finally made the decision well

1337
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,920
with everyone having to be locked down

1338
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,599
we need to do something for the

1339
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,920
community to basically like you said

1340
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,599
keep the momentum going

1341
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:38,319
give something for the community to feel

1342
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,400
proud of so we did decide to go virtual

1343
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,760
learning experience like everyone had

1344
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,640
said what works what doesn't we were all

1345
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,440
cognizant of the zoom fatigue so we did

1346
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,000
shorten the program and within america

1347
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,599
four different time zones we had to

1348
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,240
account for all those different things

1349
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,200
we did learn a lot um

1350
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,400
interesting was that our attendance

1351
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,440
we had over 2 100

1352
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:08,160
attendees for our first virtual event

1353
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,319
and what was interesting is not only

1354
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:12,480
from north america we had folks from

1355
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,559
europe all over the globe right and what

1356
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:17,680
that showed us was that

1357
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,079
it everywhere being able to do things

1358
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,839
such as a high rate or virtual platform

1359
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,400
opens that up and because it was very at

1360
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,960
the time we charged nothing we had

1361
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,119
students we had anyone who was not your

1362
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,000
traditional attendees here at nanag

1363
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,160
tried to figure out what this was about

1364
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,480
so i think that opened up a lot of

1365
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:41,119
opportunities as well as traditionally

1366
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:43,280
we would only get speakers that were

1367
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,480
from

1368
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,280
uh locally or in north america but we

1369
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,440
had speakers all over the globe

1370
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,200
one thing that we did try was

1371
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:53,280
pre-recording all the content which

1372
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,040
again i know that there's

1373
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,880
differences in that but

1374
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,720
part of that was because we weren't

1375
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,880
ensuring what the the internet

1376
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,680
connection was like but you know we also

1377
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,119
saw that

1378
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,520
maybe it didn't have the same impact

1379
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,839
so we started doing things like hybrid

1380
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:13,280
where some are recording some are live

1381
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,280
one other challenge that i'll note here

1382
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,800
is like you said you know we were trying

1383
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,200
to use uh commercial platforms and that

1384
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,960
just wasn't working for us

1385
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,359
so nanak did decide to essentially build

1386
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:28,000
our own uh meeting platform and i think

1387
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,079
as far as i've heard it's been pretty

1388
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:32,559
successful uh if there's any feedback

1389
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:34,960
again leave it in the surveys

1390
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,760
but

1391
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,599
outside of that i think the only other

1392
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,720
thing was

1393
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,839
from a challenge point of view was

1394
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,400
when things started opening back up we

1395
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,920
were very

1396
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,480
wanting to get back in person but then

1397
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,599
having to deal with whatever the

1398
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,240
local guidelines were even entering here

1399
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,520
right we have

1400
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,760
different guidelines so trying to

1401
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,800
protect the community as well as

1402
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,520
get that back in person and then also

1403
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,200
obviously things like run of show how

1404
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,040
does that differ with things hybrid

1405
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,280
people in person so that we also gave

1406
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,800
the same experience to people that are

1407
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,640
remote

1408
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,480
and then final comment as far as

1409
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,200
finances yeah it's it's been rough

1410
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,280
we've also had to dip into the the

1411
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,440
coffers

1412
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,319
thanks

1413
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,640
i have a question yeah

1414
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,520
so

1415
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,079
your previous question leads into into a

1416
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,960
different discussion now okay

1417
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,480
um before kovitz usually nog meetings

1418
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,040
was like in person and somebody was

1419
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,880
streaming on youtube and somebody was

1420
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,680
monitoring a chat for questions from

1421
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,880
people online and that was basically it

1422
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,839
then we went into covet and

1423
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,760
people online that were participating

1424
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,400
remotely got used to a higher level of

1425
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,200
interactivity online because all the

1426
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,240
stuff

1427
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,720
of a nog was online and was basically um

1428
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,000
very very interactive but now when we go

1429
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,640
when we go into how we call it a hybrid

1430
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,760
meeting

1431
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,040
now you need

1432
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,000
staff

1433
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,760
in the room to take care of of of the

1434
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,760
the nog meeting itself

1435
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,000
and the online people is expecting the

1436
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,400
same level of interaction like it was

1437
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,480
during the covet times so that means you

1438
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,280
you need to double the staff

1439
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,359
how are we going to deal with this do we

1440
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,760
want to go back to what was before and

1441
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,880
just stream on youtube and monitor chat

1442
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,760
or do we want to invest into

1443
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,680
keeping that level of interaction um

1444
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,480
further on that's now the big question

1445
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,720
conveniently that was my next question

1446
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,759
basically thank you

1447
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,200
fabulous timing i if i if i may

1448
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,880
uh i think that

1449
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,079
that

1450
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:55,599
should i rephrase it so i mean the

1451
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,359
question really is how are we going to

1452
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:58,720
move forward

1453
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,640
post the covid's virtual only experience

1454
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,240
you know and what other lessons have we

1455
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,559
learned because of that that we wouldn't

1456
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,720
perhaps have learned otherwise anyway

1457
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,319
patrick

1458
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:13,599
um i think what you said about nanak and

1459
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,200
i think that was echoed by pretty much

1460
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,680
everyone else is like the fact that we

1461
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,559
could

1462
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,880
audience to a whole new group of people

1463
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,800
that we've never seen before and that

1464
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,200
was never engaged that basically answers

1465
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,000
the question we cannot go back it's it

1466
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,079
it has to stay this way and it can't

1467
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:30,960
change

1468
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,720
and but you're absolutely right it's

1469
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,480
like it's double the staff it's double

1470
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,040
the effort it it also is depending on

1471
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,280
how you run it double the cost or to a

1472
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,720
certain amount

1473
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,640
having a higher quality internet

1474
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,880
standard is more expensive so we need to

1475
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,040
deal with that absolutely

1476
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,720
and we need more volunteers as a

1477
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,799
community to to support that and help

1478
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:52,880
that it's like and i think you can take

1479
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,559
that as a call from all of us wearing

1480
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,880
our nog hats for more volunteers for our

1481
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,280
dogs because i mean it is something i

1482
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,119
think we are all struggling with

1483
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,200
particularly getting younger new people

1484
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,000
from the community to come in because

1485
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
with one exception we're all getting a

1486
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,559
little grey

1487
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,720
i'll say again it's it's an evolution

1488
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,640
journey um

1489
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,480
just because we're doing hybrid in the

1490
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,000
way that we currently are doesn't mean

1491
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,520
that that's the way it's going to stay

1492
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,799
and i think we have to be very

1493
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,720
open-minded about what the community

1494
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,760
wants

1495
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,839
um of course those of

1496
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:30,640
um

1497
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,920
our generation apart from new porsche um

1498
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:35,440
we are used to

1499
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,000
um we are used to actually going and

1500
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,520
physically attending conferences but

1501
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,960
what i found is that there are quite a

1502
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,720
lot of younger people who

1503
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,960
some of them um actually don't want to

1504
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,240
go to these they just want to stay

1505
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
online and they want to participate that

1506
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,640
way i mean i look at for example my

1507
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,040
daughter and she's playing roblox and

1508
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,799
she's got youtube going on her phone and

1509
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,319
at the same time she's got chat windows

1510
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,079
and she's on face time with her friends

1511
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,280
and there's all these things going on

1512
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,200
and for her yes meeting her friends is

1513
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,200
great but when she's not there she can

1514
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:04,720
collaborate and i think we have to be

1515
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:08,240
mindful of that type of working

1516
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,559
and if we do want to have

1517
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:12,799
the the newer entrance in the community

1518
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,079
and those who are going to run the

1519
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,599
internet in the future

1520
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,359
i think we need to be

1521
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:19,599
cognizant of that type of thing so i

1522
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:21,119
don't think that we can go back and i

1523
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,400
agree with you and this is the way we

1524
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,799
did things and it worked but then we got

1525
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,480
into this bubble of this is the way it

1526
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:27,599
works and we don't need to change

1527
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:28,559
anything

1528
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,960
and it's the same as actually

1529
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,559
irc works we don't need to change

1530
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,319
anything so i think we have to

1531
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,799
constantly look at how to change how to

1532
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:38,319
make things better

1533
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,680
um so i don't know the answer to your

1534
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,839
question as to but i do think hybrid is

1535
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,599
the right answer for the next two or

1536
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:45,520
three years so i'm getting out of

1537
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,319
comfort area

1538
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,680
okay

1539
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,160
well at one point

1540
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,920
we didn't have to change that much

1541
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,240
because we were already streaming uh for

1542
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,880
example and on ocd live on youtube and

1543
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,559
the website so

1544
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:05,119
many folks who couldn't travel or would

1545
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,720
not get allowance to travel from their

1546
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,640
employer they could already follow the

1547
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,160
the analog day

1548
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,240
and they could ask questions via again

1549
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:13,280
irc

1550
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,440
and we need to work on that but um so

1551
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,880
there was already that opportunity to

1552
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:18,960
interact as well with the speaker what

1553
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,520
we did change is obviously to have a

1554
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,160
remote presenters at joining the

1555
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,000
conference so that was especially a

1556
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,240
challenge for the av crew how do you

1557
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,160
look them in and and how do you make

1558
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,240
sure that if a question is asked in the

1559
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,240
room that they also get that audio and

1560
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,079
video and stuff so that definitely

1561
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,319
changed and i think

1562
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:41,599
going hybrid or or continuing to to

1563
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,280
offer meetings in a hybrid fashion that

1564
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,200
that's definitely here to stay and and

1565
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,079
and it's a good thing um that by doing

1566
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,400
so we're opening the door for

1567
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,200
uh

1568
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,440
another generation and and people who

1569
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,640
are not able to uh attend in person or

1570
00:57:56,640 --> 00:58:00,400
pre become and present in person um

1571
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,960
so yeah so so that's definitely agreed

1572
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,839
the way forward

1573
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,640
well um

1574
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,880
i have to say um

1575
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,960
having come out to meetings just made me

1576
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,720
realize how important

1577
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,640
uh human connection is

1578
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,040
in person you know physical meeting

1579
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,799
being able to see people in front of you

1580
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,480
as opposed to a screen

1581
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,559
shaking hands hugs and all of that it's

1582
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,400
very important and that's one of the

1583
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
biggest things that makes

1584
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,000
these kind of meetings work and we

1585
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,240
cannot take that away so

1586
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:34,559
moving forward how do we do it of course

1587
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,000
we want to have physical meetings we

1588
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,839
want to be able to see each other and

1589
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:40,480
interact with each other but

1590
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,680
we do have to consider the fact that

1591
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,280
we can't always travel

1592
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,079
or

1593
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,079
for whatever reasons people can't travel

1594
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,960
whether it's a pandemic or

1595
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,520
other reasons we do have to cater for

1596
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,920
for everybody so i think hybrid is

1597
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,680
definitely the way forward

1598
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,760
but we can never take away the human

1599
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,559
aspect of physical contact and physical

1600
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:05,559
interaction

1601
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,079
now i i agree there with the human

1602
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:10,319
networking portion that where it has to

1603
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,480
be face-to-face eye-to-eye where there's

1604
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,480
something different there

1605
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,040
but to the point of the new generation

1606
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,160
on how they choose to interact

1607
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,760
like you said there are many that don't

1608
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,760
want to be there live in person but

1609
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,160
they're totally capable they are

1610
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,599
interacting in their own methods and

1611
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:29,280
trying to unlock that

1612
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,040
i think again hybrid is going to be the

1613
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,839
way that we're going to be running um

1614
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,599
for the foreseeable future until we

1615
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,160
figure out maybe someone in the audience

1616
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,760
can figure out how we're all virtually

1617
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,440
there and we can emulate you know we're

1618
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,440
all just set that boxes talking to each

1619
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,480
other but

1620
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,559
um

1621
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,640
one of the things is as

1622
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,720
uh nadal has built up these tools and

1623
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,119
whatnot we're exploring how we can

1624
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,440
uh share these with other nogs you know

1625
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,440
the the platforms the toolings that we

1626
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,920
built the lessons that we've learned so

1627
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,359
other knocks don't have to recreate the

1628
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,680
wheel

1629
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,880
should you connect yeah

1630
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,040
yeah

1631
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:12,160
just want us to emphasize that we have

1632
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:12,960
now

1633
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,440
beautiful tools for organizing a hybrid

1634
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,680
or

1635
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
virtual conferences and since the

1636
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,599
community

1637
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,680
outbreak started

1638
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,559
the

1639
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,760
developers

1640
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,720
moved

1641
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,680
make a a big move forward in their

1642
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,920
development so

1643
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,599
even some

1644
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:36,079
internal organizers may may decided to

1645
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,400
may decide to change the format

1646
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,920
that you probably don't need even even

1647
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,559
to have a mic in the room

1648
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,559
all the questions can be uh

1649
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,160
and all the

1650
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:49,760
cooperation with the local audience can

1651
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,520
can be made

1652
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,119
online

1653
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,640
so

1654
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,359
just think about this if you still want

1655
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:58,559
to

1656
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:01,599
run the hybrid meetings

1657
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:02,559
thanks

1658
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,000
john would you like to answer your

1659
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,400
question

1660
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,280
yes and no

1661
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,280
because i i don't know i don't know the

1662
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:14,160
answer actually i i agree with with

1663
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:16,319
patrick and the national we

1664
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,400
we shouldn't be going back

1665
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,160
to what was before um

1666
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,119
but

1667
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,720
at the same time the amount of

1668
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,280
volunteers is

1669
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,079
the same or lower than before so we need

1670
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,359
to sort this on both sides of equation

1671
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,440
if the community wants

1672
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,559
to have

1673
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,359
the same level of participation and

1674
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:41,520
engagement online then we need more

1675
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,880
volunteers

1676
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,119
so this is the equation that that we

1677
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:47,280
need to solve and if if we can't solve

1678
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,400
this then we're going to what we were

1679
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:54,720
what we had before it's it's very simple

1680
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,960
any last comments on this

1681
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,400
i have a contradicting follow-up that i

1682
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,359
would like everyone's input in if i may

1683
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:06,559
of course

1684
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:07,520
so

1685
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,319
let's go specifically into speakers

1686
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:12,400
and ask the question of should we have

1687
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,400
remote speakers so that's my next

1688
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,400
question

1689
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,160
you shouldn't have given that

1690
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,839
stuff to read before no i didn't know

1691
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:23,440
sorry please feel free go ahead

1692
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:26,720
we still need you

1693
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,598
i don't know why i'm here

1694
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,640
um there's been some conversation today

1695
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,799
and yesterday about remote speakers

1696
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:39,520
and nogs have different policies on them

1697
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,200
and might be interesting to hear what

1698
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,200
the individual logs

1699
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,720
have to say some have very simple

1700
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:47,440
policies others have

1701
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,920
it depends like forces so

1702
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,720
melchior what's your policy

1703
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,760
well so so yes we offer opportunity for

1704
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,480
presenters to be there locally

1705
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,799
sorry remote

1706
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:03,119
but we expect it to be a live

1707
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:05,680
presentation uh because in our opinion

1708
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,559
if you

1709
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:09,520
present remote and you pre-record it it

1710
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,079
it's obviously very handy for from the

1711
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,400
organizational part of you but you miss

1712
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,039
the energy of someone presenting life i

1713
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,640
mean it's different

1714
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,039
i noticed it myself as well if you speak

1715
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:22,559
to a screen and your notes recorded and

1716
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,640
everything can be edited etc then if

1717
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,160
you're presenting live in front of a

1718
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,119
screen

1719
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:29,280
so yes we do welcome remote presenters

1720
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,640
but they have to be live

1721
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,400
yeah

1722
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,359
well

1723
01:03:35,359 --> 01:03:37,839
we had a we had the

1724
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:41,039
ripe meeting in berlin that was hybrids

1725
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:42,880
and because of

1726
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,240
of

1727
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,920
many people from the program committee

1728
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:48,160
couldn't make it because of

1729
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,520
different things

1730
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,160
uh the rest that was there we had to

1731
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:52,960
share

1732
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,359
uh the vast amount of

1733
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:57,520
sessions to chair so that meeting i

1734
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,559
checked six or seven sessions

1735
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:01,520
and

1736
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,839
i was i was observing the community

1737
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:08,720
quite observantly

1738
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,440
about the the the level of attention

1739
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,319
when there was a person on stage or when

1740
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,680
there was somebody presenting remotely

1741
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,760
and to be really honest

1742
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,000
when people were presenting remotely

1743
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,960
there was lots of people reading emails

1744
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,359
uh it was it was seen

1745
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:30,160
as i saw the big difference

1746
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:31,119
in

1747
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,000
people's attention in the audience

1748
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,839
um of course

1749
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,480
we welcome remote presenters we welcome

1750
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,280
remote participation but the reaction

1751
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,960
from the community

1752
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,359
um was not that great

1753
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,520
and that was live presenters or

1754
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,920
recorded uh live

1755
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,400
live presenters basically because were

1756
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,400
there any recorded ones

1757
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,000
i don't remember if you have any

1758
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,160
recorded one i don't think so

1759
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,760
oh sure

1760
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,280
well um

1761
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:04,640
we do welcome

1762
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:05,599
um

1763
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:08,880
online presentations but presenters but

1764
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,240
we prefer that

1765
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,280
they do it in person at the meeting

1766
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,720
however we do consider that

1767
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,480
circumstances might prevent them from

1768
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:17,839
doing so

1769
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:18,960
but

1770
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,079
we prefer to have people come and join

1771
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,000
us at the conference and and is that

1772
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,280
live remote or recorded remote live live

1773
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,480
not recorded okay

1774
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,960
you came off um does

1775
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,160
uh

1776
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:36,799
accept remote presentations

1777
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,680
um

1778
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,520
as porsha said it's preferable that the

1779
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,160
speaker is in the room because it allows

1780
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:43,599
those people in the room to ask them

1781
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:45,119
questions and

1782
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,119
and mingle with that speaker later on

1783
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:49,280
during the breaks during the lunch

1784
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,240
um but you know of course um

1785
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,599
there are various reasons why some

1786
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,319
speakers can't travel um and we we want

1787
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,960
to make sure that we are um fully

1788
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,480
inclusive in in that regard um some who

1789
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,880
can't afford to travel some who

1790
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,200
are unable to travel for other reasons

1791
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,200
uh covered reasons for example but they

1792
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,359
have great content and content which is

1793
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,000
actually right now that the audience

1794
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,079
should it would be would be beneficial

1795
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,440
for the audience to listen to right now

1796
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,760
so um

1797
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,960
it's ongoing i i think i think it's

1798
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,559
going to we're going to have more and

1799
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,440
more room at presentations of course um

1800
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,599
generally it's around 50 50.

1801
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:31,920
um and if it's if it stays around 50 50

1802
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:33,200
that makes me feel a bit more

1803
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,960
comfortable than if it was only one

1804
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,960
speaker in the room and 10 speakers who

1805
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,559
were remote because then you think well

1806
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,240
what was the point of that

1807
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,760
um

1808
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,000
yeah so what we do

1809
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
i mean we've done off i think

1810
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,720
we've only had one recorded tour

1811
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,720
yes experimented with that and the rest

1812
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,280
have all been live and that talk did

1813
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,880
stand out as being

1814
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,400
different from the others i think

1815
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,240
because of that yes so even though this

1816
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,480
the the remote presentation which was

1817
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,880
recorded pre-recorded the speaker was

1818
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,200
available live for answering questions

1819
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,119
uh it did seem there was a little bit of

1820
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,880
a difference in in that but i'd like to

1821
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,640
ask jan uh when you were observing

1822
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,400
people at the right meeting

1823
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,039
um was um did you notice the age

1824
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,799
difference between those who were

1825
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,200
reading their emails while there was a

1826
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,440
remote presenter

1827
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,520
and those and the age of those who

1828
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:25,440
weren't reading their emails

1829
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,520
well in general people were more

1830
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,839
attentive when person was

1831
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,440
on on stage

1832
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,400
because

1833
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,440
uh it's a it's a it's a human behavior

1834
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:37,599
if there is somebody looking at you and

1835
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,640
and you you open your mail then

1836
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,480
you know you need to have a really good

1837
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,799
reason why you open your mail and not

1838
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:46,880
pay attention to the presenter but if

1839
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,520
the person is on the screen then you you

1840
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:51,599
go like in your head oh he can't see me

1841
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,319
anyway right so i can i can do my mail

1842
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,440
and not pay attention yeah so

1843
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,240
on that uh in that respect um i would

1844
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,079
question was was the presentation

1845
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:03,920
compelling enough was it interesting

1846
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,200
enough

1847
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,799
the thing is that even when there are

1848
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,160
even when there are speakers in the room

1849
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,480
for example there are some people who

1850
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:12,960
are nervous about speaking or they know

1851
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,440
their content but the delivery is fairly

1852
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,799
dry and that comes down to in my in my

1853
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:20,479
opinion it comes down to needing to

1854
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,158
shepherd speakers whether they are in

1855
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:25,759
the room or their remote and needing to

1856
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,839
making sure that the speaker knows how

1857
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:29,279
to present the material in an

1858
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:30,640
interesting way

1859
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,238
um is probably something that we need to

1860
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:34,640
learn how to do

1861
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,238
and so whether it's remote or in the

1862
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:38,319
room i personally i don't think it would

1863
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:40,158
make a difference if that delivery was

1864
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,600
on point

1865
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:42,399
well

1866
01:08:42,399 --> 01:08:44,640
that's why i said i i

1867
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:48,399
i got quite a quite a wide sample with

1868
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,479
six or seven sessions and

1869
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:52,880
i noticed the difference

1870
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,238
right sure

1871
01:08:54,238 --> 01:08:56,158
yeah patrick would you like to answer

1872
01:08:56,158 --> 01:08:57,520
your question

1873
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,799
sure

1874
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:01,520
and i was again completely so

1875
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,479
the the dinar background uh dinock

1876
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:07,520
has two different sides how we encourage

1877
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,920
we absolutely encourage um remote

1878
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,479
presentations we only do live we don't

1879
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:16,000
do recorded we don't allow that um for

1880
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,920
the virtual meetups

1881
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,439
so we have a virtual meetup session

1882
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,040
where everything is remote and everyone

1883
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,880
is virtual we absolutely encourage that

1884
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,439
we absolutely encourage newcomers to go

1885
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,679
to that first and have their first

1886
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,520
experiences there

1887
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:32,839
we talk about the actual big conference

1888
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,439
um we have a

1889
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:39,679
very very highly preferable on-site live

1890
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,640
person speaker we make exceptions if it

1891
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,238
is an exceptional speaker that we

1892
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:45,679
absolutely want

1893
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:48,479
but we really want people to be inside

1894
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:50,640
and it's like i completely agree with

1895
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,479
what jan said it's like i saw the same

1896
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,800
it ripe um i'll be honest i saw the same

1897
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,159
here as well

1898
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,320
and i saw it at a couple of other

1899
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,960
conferences the the atmosphere in the

1900
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,719
room and the setup in the room is a

1901
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:04,560
completely different one if you have

1902
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:06,800
speakers on stage if they're present if

1903
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,800
they're talking to the people and if we

1904
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,280
want to keep the the conversations and

1905
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,520
the meetings alive as they are in person

1906
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:14,560
as well

1907
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,040
we need to make that happen

1908
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,040
and you you know what's interesting that

1909
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:21,280
this session is turning into what we

1910
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,280
have at tribe meetings it's a nog

1911
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:24,420
organizers meeting

1912
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:26,560
[Laughter]

1913
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,600
so here's the thing is we all

1914
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,520
collaborate with each other anyway yeah

1915
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,120
i mean it's not that we i mean when i

1916
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:33,280
set the thing up it was basically two

1917
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,600
minutes of all my open chat windows are

1918
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,199
you coming to nano great you're on a

1919
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:37,610
panel

1920
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,760
[Laughter]

1921
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,239
defense i'll uh say i'm bearing in mind

1922
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,480
we only have four minutes make it quick

1923
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,280
well i'll say that we do um

1924
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,040
now that we're back in

1925
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,920
person that we would prefer talks uh

1926
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,760
live in person

1927
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:54,800
but

1928
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,719
to the point where some people choose

1929
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:58,560
not to or cannot

1930
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,080
we allow obviously remote and

1931
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,679
pre-recorded talks i think is really the

1932
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,640
key here is that i mean look at the

1933
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,880
opening debate with vince and john

1934
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,000
that was still compelling it depends on

1935
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,560
who the speaker is what the content is

1936
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:15,760
and

1937
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:18,239
for us to have been able to get those

1938
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:20,800
two at the same time upstage which would

1939
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,880
probably be impossible so to be able to

1940
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,360
have that recording i think is key that

1941
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,159
opens up a lot more speakers because of

1942
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:31,679
schedules or whatnot so again i mean

1943
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,000
preference would be in-person live

1944
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,920
remote live and then recording i think

1945
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,040
you see i would actually say that vince

1946
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,719
talk was different because that was he

1947
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:43,120
was performing to somebody else it was a

1948
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,840
recording of a of a live event which is

1949
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,040
jb and talking to each other rather than

1950
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,560
the standout

1951
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:52,719
which is people recording to the screen

1952
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:54,480
and there's no audience whereas he had

1953
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,920
jb to interact with so it's interesting

1954
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,120
and i agree that was a really good

1955
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:01,199
session but it was it wasn't like the

1956
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:02,320
standard

1957
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,560
presenting to a screen which is i think

1958
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,800
what people are talking about here

1959
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,199
being very dead and

1960
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,440
so so one thing because we did run into

1961
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,199
that and

1962
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:14,719
and i don't know again if this is

1963
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,239
changed on the pc but some of the

1964
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:19,040
recordings now a pc member is there so

1965
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,640
not they're only talking to a screen

1966
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,159
they can see some visual feedback at

1967
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:24,080
least from one person so that there is

1968
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:26,239
some kind of interactiveness from the

1969
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,159
speaker

1970
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,600
i mean i think what we're looking for is

1971
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,440
interactive rather than

1972
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,799
talking to the television set

1973
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,360
any more questions from the floor i know

1974
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,840
cat has posted something in the chat

1975
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:42,159
um

1976
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,840
you've got two minutes and 23 seconds

1977
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,480
for us to answer well i'm so short

1978
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:51,199
she can increase the time no cat called

1979
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,719
packer and

1980
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:55,440
um my question was is there any thoughts

1981
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:58,400
around making a global like matter most

1982
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,880
or something since slack costs money um

1983
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,440
for all network engineers not just for

1984
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:04,800
each of your individual regions and your

1985
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:07,679
individual nogs i would like to have a

1986
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,679
pound ix replacement i used to be in

1987
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,679
there but you know irc is dying no

1988
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,719
offense

1989
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:14,880
um i do agree with that sentiment so i'd

1990
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,960
love to see more global modern chat that

1991
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,320
i love our community but that's still

1992
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,320
not the same as like our c was

1993
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,080
so that's what i'm looking for i think

1994
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:25,120
this is a great idea and mr chairman of

1995
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:27,040
gnabort should we

1996
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,120
create a matter most

1997
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:33,440
server for all knox globally

1998
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:36,239
he's looking at a different direction

1999
01:13:36,239 --> 01:13:38,560
i mean certainly log fi

2000
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,199
off and euro ix share a server and i

2001
01:13:41,199 --> 01:13:42,960
think there are other organizations like

2002
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,239
g a does

2003
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,719
offers us i believe part of their things

2004
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,560
i mean the problem is that this is all

2005
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,560
act local and we need something that's

2006
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,040
bigger and funded jeff

2007
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,360
uh we have another remote question uh

2008
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,840
simon labelle asks any thought of

2009
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,480
organizing a worldwide nog

2010
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:04,320
while being partnered with local nogs

2011
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,280
uh

2012
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,120
i think it's that's kind of like our ir

2013
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:11,199
policy isn't it really doing a global

2014
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,360
hurry up policy first first you need a

2015
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:14,800
policy then you need to get everyone to

2016
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:17,120
agree to it um

2017
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,719
it's people

2018
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,120
and time really

2019
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,000
yeah nate sorry um i don't think we

2020
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,600
actually want to go there

2021
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,040

2022
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,840
sorry but

2023
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,760
you know okay so with an rir police a

2024
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,560
global rir policy you have to have the

2025
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,719
regional policy and then everybody has

2026
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:38,080
to agree they want that if they don't

2027
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,159
agree to that it's not going to happen

2028
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,880

2032
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:52,560

local area and then push them out to the

2037
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:06,320
