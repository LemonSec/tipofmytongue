00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,758
at another

62
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,760
nana conference and also it's great to

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,760
be back in canada

64
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
so i want to take a few minutes this

65
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
morning and i'm going to talk about a

66
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,319
few things in regards to the

67
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
organization and the community just to

68
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,680
kind of bring you guys up to speed to

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,720
some of the things that are happening

70
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,120
within the org

71
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
so first thing i'd like to talk about is

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,840
registration fee increase everyone loves

73
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
to pay more money don't we

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,080
no one likes to pay more money

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,400
but things cost more and so therefore as

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,840
an organization we're going to have to

77
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,160
push those costs forward to be able to

78
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,640
provide again a a good meeting

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,959
experience and also to make sure that we

80
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,480
push in some ways to move toward the

81
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,720
black in the way we're operating so here

82
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,640
we've got two tables one showing you

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,360
away where our costs were before another

84
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,319
showing where our costs are advancing to

85
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,319
the one thing to note in our next

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,920
meeting our early bird fee will be 675

87
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,760
if you want if you look at this chart

88
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,120
and if you look at if you're talking

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,720
about the late fee

90
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,360
for a non-fimber pricing versus early

91
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,560
bird for member pricing you really best

92
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,720
you know kind of you focus on is to

93
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
register early if you register early

94
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,920
you're not going to be incurring

95
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,480
additional costs or you'll be minimizing

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,120
the increase that you're experiencing

97
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,879
also to note

98
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,720
and i'll give you a comparative ietf

99
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,599
registration for early bird is 700 so

100
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,400
we're still

101
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
you know cheaper than they are or equal

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,640
in the terms of the non-member pricing

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,360
but we feed you and we believe that

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
feeding you is an important part of

105
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
building community so we want to

106
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,680
continue to do that so

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
help support nanox so through

108
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,920
sponsorship and donations and

109
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
volunteering so that we can continue to

110
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
bring you guys the best experience while

111
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,840
at the same time minimizing how we start

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,200
how much we charge you for this

113
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,519
experience

114
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,080
so development projects so there's a big

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,280
development project that we've been

116
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,680
working on something that the community

117
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,519
has been asking for for a great deal of

118
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,959
time and that is for an appointment tool

119
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,640
as much as people come to now log

120
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,720
meetings for the educational experience

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,798
and also connecting with others this is

122
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,600
a great place to do business and we're

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,680
trying to create and and provide you a

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
tool that will facilitate that

125
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,919
engagement in um in terms of making

126

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,039
and technology and more we also can

171
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,120
create any type of group that you're

172
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,880
you're looking for if you find something

173
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,120
that that's missing go to our nanak

174
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,919
website click on the feedback button and

175
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,520
then just say hey edward we'd love to

176
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
have a group set up that we can get

177
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,280
together this so we're trying to

178
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,400
encourage you to connect more with us

179
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
have a way prior to the meeting to be

180
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,199
able to gather people together and meet

181
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,919
for example sean winstead who's on nanox

182
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,880
staff had a walking affinity group and

183
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,199
this morning i think it was

184
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,199
four or five of us went out walking

185
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
around through the underground as a way

186
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,960
of kind of connecting and i had some

187
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,120
great conversations on the way so these

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,039
affinity groups are a great way for us

189
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
to connect and to build and enhance the

190
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
community that we have here at nanak

191
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,280
so i'm going to take a minute and talk

192
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
about our

193
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
community

194
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,120
forum and what you can find there so

195
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,560
when you land on the page again

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,400
community.nano.org

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,759
currently the way it's structured you

198
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,319
have to have an account at nanog it's

199

free to sign up have an account and then

200

once you have your account you can then

201
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,080
come to the community server what it

202
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,039
will do when you go to

203
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,960
community.nanolog.org

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
it will push you back to the nanak

205
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
account for validation we use rf2

206
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,199
validation for this and then boom you

207
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,560
can be right back right down in the

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
community forum so here's what the

209
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,560
landing page looks like and one of the

210
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
things i want to talk about for a moment

211
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,720
is that we have a mirror of the mailing

212
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,440
list and so i'm going to show you a few

213
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,720
items that will show you how the

214
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,880
community uh the community forum

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,919
functions and works for you so if you

216
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:42,720
were to click on the first page landing

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,599
you into the the mail in this mirror

218
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,199
here's what you're going to see you're

219
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,840
going to see a series of the most recent

220
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,280
things that have hit the mailing list

221
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,919
again this is read only you can see how

222
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,160
many replies that we've had how many

223
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,160
views what's when was the last time you

224
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,720
had activity in that if you dig in

225
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,599
further you'll see boom someone pasted

226
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,080
an article in here now what

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
um discourse does if someone put a link

228
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
it'll automatically grab a caption from

229
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,919
that website detailing what it is

230
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,720
there'll be information there off to the

231
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
right side you'll see

232
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,400
a little information

233
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,520
showing you

234
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,000
what is the timeline of all the

235
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,240
communication that goes along on that

236
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,400
thread and that a synopsis right across

237
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
the bottom you'll see who are the major

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
contributors to that particular thread

239
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,640
scrolling down further here you'll see

240
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,559
replies and comments now what this is

241
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,880
doing again it's a mirror of mailman all

242
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,320
it's doing is taking the information is

243
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,040
going into mailman and posting it out in

244
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,800
a graphical format

245
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
it's the same way this would function in

246
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,720
terms of in the affinity groups you'd be

247
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,680
able to go in and either through email

248
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,320
communicate with it or directly online

249
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,800
being able to make a submission reply

250
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,040
if you for example when it came to

251
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,640
walking i asked dinesh if he wanted to

252
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,839
walk with us it grabbed dinesh sent him

253
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,000
a email correspondence asking if you

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,480
want to participate dennis replied to

255
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,160
the email and then it appeared right

256
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
there in the forum so you can either

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
interact with it directly or you can

258
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,080
interact with it uh via mail

259
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
so um

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,160
nano college immersion program we

261
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,040
restructured our nci program we wanted

262
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,959
to have it to be a lot more targeted to

263
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,839
focus on bringing the most qualified

264
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,279
students to dynamo to experience this

265
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,040
it is now going to be

266
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,000
sponsor based

267
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,760
the qualifications mirror the same

268
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,839
qualifications that we have for

269
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,920
the scholarship program

270
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
and there's also now an opportunity for

271
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,399
graduate students to apply individually

272
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,440
the way the ncia program is structured a

273
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,000
a professor can bring up to five

274
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
students along with them the reason why

275
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
we have that stipulation and why

276
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
undergraduate students can't come

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,920
individually is because we don't have

278
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,680
the space to really chaperone them

279
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,760
because a lot of them will be under 21.

280
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,440
having a professor who come along with

281
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
them will one make sure there's someone

282
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
who's invested in their education coming

283
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,200
along with them secondly help to keep

284
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,519
them focused as they come through and

285
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,440
through and enhance the learning process

286
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
for the students for graduate students

287
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,760
they can apply independently again

288
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,200
graduate students that level are much

289
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,440
more self-managed

290
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,279
as i mentioned before the program is now

291
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,680
sponsor funded um in this particular

292
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,839
nano we had students from howard who

293
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,680
were participating so it was a great

294
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,160
victory to have some students from hbcu

295
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,920
attend nanong and it's part of our

296
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,000
commitment to diversity and expanding of

297
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,959
our community

298
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,120
the unite analog 84 odds bosman report

299
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,839
so

300
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,360
um the odds the odds budsmen exist

301
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,120
again as part of that commitment to

302
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,959
diversity and inclusion within our

303
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,519
organization it's one thing to say the

304
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,760
diversity matters to you that inclusion

305
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
matters to you it's another thing to

306
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
really kind of put your money where your

307
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,800
mouth is for us to have an environment

308
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,360
at nano if we want to bring diversity

309
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,640
one it's not just going to walk in

310
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,680
through the front door you're going to

311
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,120
have to go out and

312
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,040
solicit it and work to bring it in

313
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,880
secondly is when people come they need

314
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,480
to feel that they're safe that they're

315
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,560
included and they're welcome within our

316
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,680
community

317
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,680
and so having the odds buds here is

318
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,480
about

319
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,959
creating a structure creating a formal

320
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,600
space where if i do have experience a

321
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,680
problem that i can go to the advancement

322
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,200
for support again which that would be

323
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
directed to me

324
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
the way things were structured before if

325
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,320
there were any complaints or problems

326
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,640
they came to me directly which is fine

327
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
but then it's all based upon my

328
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,800
particular internal bias the other thing

329
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,320
is what happens if you have a problem

330
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,079
with me who are you going to go and turn

331
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,480
to having the advisement as a third

332
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,639
party here to support and protect the

333
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,480
best interests of the community was one

334
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,160
of the best ways that we could go about

335
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,920
assuring that you could have the best

336
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,440
experience possible

337
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,680
now here is a list of some of the things

338
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,519
that the other men found in terms of

339
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,079
formal concerns that came about

340
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,519
well i'm not going to take and read all

341
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,079
of this here in this space but at the

342
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
bottom of the screen there you can see

343
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,399
where the link to the full report is

344
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,720
if you go to the nanog website go to

345
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,519
resources scroll down from resources and

346
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,160
you'll find us budsmen click on that

347
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,839
you'll get a description of our odds

348
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,839
budsman at the very bottom of that

349
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,240
you'll see a link to the report so going

350
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,240
forward after each collusion of each

351
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,560
meeting there will be a report we're

352
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,959
graded the actual grade on their last

353
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,480
was 71 out of 100 we do have work to do

354
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,560
but i believe we're moving in that right

355
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,959
direction and to that end

356
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,480
i did an interview with the students

357
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,320
from howard and first they wanted to

358
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
communicate to all thank you so much for

359
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,200
having them at the nanog event they had

360
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,480
a wonderful time

361
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,120
they said that they felt very included

362
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
in fact the biggest comment was i wish i

363
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
had known about this earlier it would

364
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,600
have really had a profound impact on

365
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,920
their college experience so thank you

366
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
all for making sure that everyone felt

367
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,519
welcome and a part of our community

368
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,959
annual report our annual report will be

369
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,120
released shortly we were hoping to have

370
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,600
it released prior to the meeting but

371
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
we got busy but um you'll be seeing it

372
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
in the next couple of weeks it'll be

373
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,279
you'll find out about in our newsletter

374
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,519
we'll also post it out on our mailing

375
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,680
list and also on social media so look

376
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,760
for that to come out soon our annual

377
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,639
report is our effort in terms of the

378
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,880
board to provide transparency to our

379
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,120
community about how our organization is

380
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,279
run the projects that we're working on

381
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,279
and how we're trying to build community

382
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,600
and further enhance the way nanohog as

383
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,480
an organization operates

384
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,399
that being said i'll turn off the

385
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,720
program but before i do

386
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,320
i want to give a particular

387
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
congratulations to the program committee

388
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,480
i think they have done a stellar job

389
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,560
with this particular program this is

390
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,639
comes back from efforts to start a few

391
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,639
years ago where the program community

392
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,399
tried to find ways that they could

393
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,720
better serve our community to provide a

394
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,800
better program and i think this this

395
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
particular event is the fruits of that

396
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,880
later so if everyone could kind of give

397
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,399
a round of applause for all those you're

398
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,839
part of the program committee

399
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,080
thanks

400
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,480
[Applause]

401
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,920
thank you

402
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,600
i'm kat karinsky chair of the firm

403
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,839
committee

404
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
so um where how we got here

405
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,560
to this amazing

406
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,880
agenda you saw uh these last few days is

407
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,160
we've been doing a rolling call for

408
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,839
presentations

409
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,320
um and this means like if you have an

410
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,440
idea

411
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,399
but you're not gonna be around for

412
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,120
nandog86 but you will be for 87. you can

413
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,959
submit that now you used to always have

414
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,360
to wait a couple years ago until it was

415
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,880
just for that call for presentations for

416
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,320
the next analog

417
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,279
and

418
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,440
then maybe you forget it didn't work out

419
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
but now you can pre-plan this is

420
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,959
especially nice for our overseas

421
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,160
attendees they have to deal with visas

422
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,760
and things too if they can plan out even

423
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
earlier than a month or two before

424
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,519
because we can also accept earlier

425
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,079
so earlier submissions give you two big

426
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,240
pros right you can get more time for

427
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,959
improvements and feedback and then um

428
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,480
we can consider it for voting you know

429
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
as soon as we have a draft slide deck

430
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,399
and then if that means we can accept it

431
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,160
early now right you can get that

432
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,440
business and those travel approvals

433
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,880
those visas all worked out and we can

434
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,959
publish the agenda much earlier than we

435
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,800
used to because we can have a lot of

436
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,639
accepted talks earlier on with the

437
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,079
rolling call for submissions which did

438
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,680
happen this time we had a very early

439
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,680
published agenda if you didn't notice

440
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
because we had so many come in early um

441
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,959
right now you can submit all the way up

442
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,518
there in nanak 89.

443
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,040
us as a result of this we already have

444
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
four talks accepted and confirmed for

445
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,959
nanak 86 in hollywood and that was even

446
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,320
a few weeks ago that didn't even happen

447
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,360
this week

448
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,839
um and then we have 12 talks as of last

449
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,519
night when i made this slide that are

450
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,440
still in pending status already for

451
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,639
consideration some of those were

452
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,839
deferred because we just couldn't

453
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,160
squeeze everybody in for now get e5 and

454
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,680
some of those were submitted directly

455
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,959
486 from the beginning

456
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,480
so let's talk a little bit about the

457
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
life cycle of a talk submission

458
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,839
what does a shepherd and a content

459
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,759
reviewer do so a shepherd guides you

460
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,279
through your process the whole way from

461
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,519
submission to peer review and acceptance

462
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,519
if applicable right so when you go and

463
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,600
submit that form and here's my talk and

464
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,360
maybe i have slides maybe i don't the

465
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,720
shepherd's going to reach out to you

466
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
once that comes in they're going to help

467
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,920
guide you through everything they're

468
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,880
going to remind you if you don't have

469
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
slides you need to upload some and then

470
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,440
they're going to be the first person

471
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,800
that looks at those gives you some

472
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,279
initial feedback all right this is good

473
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,959
maybe we should flesh this out this

474
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:36,399
might not be acceptable for the nanog

475
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,639
this is too much marketing whatever

476
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,399
but they'll work with you on that

477
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,759
and then the content reviewer you can

478
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,759
think of them like your copy editor oh i

479
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,000
found a typo on slide three

480
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
hey you accidentally forgot to remove

481
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,040
that this is confidential on the bottom

482
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,160
because it's obviously not if you're

483
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,920
going to present it at nanog we get a

484
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,240
lot of those you laugh but it's true

485
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,759
people use their slide decks from work

486
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,600
right and often don't even think about

487
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,959
it but a lot of those slide deck

488
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,560
templates you get from work have

489
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,639
confidential and internal only

490
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:04,640
so your content reviewer will will catch

491
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,839
those things and make sure you don't go

492
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,119
on stage with that

493
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,959
um and then make sure that our nano

494
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,559
presentation guidelines are met you know

495
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,480
sometimes very small fonts are

496
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,240
incredibly hard to read back there or on

497
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,319
a small little phone so we're looking at

498
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,160
your font sizes to make sure that all of

499
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
you reading these slides can have a good

500
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,280
experience because you can actually read

501
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,039
the slides and not squint and have to

502
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,679
pull on the magnifying glasses

503
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,439
so here you can kind of see the the

504
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,880
circle of the cycle right you've got the

505
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,360
rolling call for proposals so we receive

506
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,640
proposals

507
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,240
we assign you that shepard and content

508
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,360
reviewer

509
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,960
hopefully get some draft slides into us

510
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,400
and then once we have all of that we've

511
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,679
worked through your draft slides that's

512
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,240
when we can do our peer review

513
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,760
and then if you are accepted then the

514
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,679
rest of this applies then your final

515
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,360
slides will be due later on we can

516
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,280
publish the

517
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,639
slides are due so

518
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,039
that looks a little backwards

519
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,120
i will fix that for next time

520
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,400
because we need to have the proper

521
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
slides for peer review not the final

522
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,559
slides but we do have to have

523
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,039
something workable um we can publish our

524
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,280
agenda get your final slides before the

525
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,799
conference and then our conference can

526
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,120
begin

527
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,559
i did want to talk about this draft

528
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,400
slides right so

529
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,600
um

530
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,360
you don't have to have your final slides

531
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,919
to be accepted for voting they just need

532
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,600
to be fleshed out a little more than

533
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,960
you're abstract

534
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
and enough to get your point across to

535
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
the reviewers of what you're planning to

536
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,039
present

537
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,799
so don't feel like you have to have a

538
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,440
100 completed and finalized presentation

539
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,600
to be considered for voting

540
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,400
60 70 80 is fine as long as you know

541
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,919
that you're gonna fix that before you do

542
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,080
your recording or show up in person

543
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,320
um so a lot of people stress about that

544
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,559
um when that worry oh but other places

545
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,080
don't require me to have slides yes we

546
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,600
do but we just want to get that rough

547
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,799
idea of where you're going with this

548
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,640
we're not looking for the full product

549
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,160
we don't expect you to commit extra time

550
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
if we may not consider the talk so

551
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,919
always just get a you know start with a

552
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,760
rough outline

553
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,120
we'll talk to you and explain if that's

554
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
enough or not and then if we like it

555
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,720
we'll we'll send it over for voting and

556
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,000
we can hopefully accept that and then

557
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,120
you can finish fleshing it out

558
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,160
we are here to increase your chances of

559
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,760
success though that is your your

560
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,120
committee members and your shepherds are

561
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,679
really your advocates right so

562
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,039
we've been getting a lot of submission

563
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,679
rates increasing um we had

564
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,880
so many submissions for this one

565
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
compared to the last few is really

566
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,559
really humbling and noisy but get your

567
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,320
draft slides in as early as possible as

568
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,440
a result if you're going to be the

569
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,360
person now that waits till the deadline

570
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,600
that that last day may even be too late

571
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
we might even be filling up before then

572
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,160
sometimes

573
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
so please get those drafts in no matter

574
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,480
how rough early on so that we can get

575
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,640
you into consideration and have more

576
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,880
time to peer review with you um and then

577
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,400
again reference the nano presentation

578
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,080
guidelines on the website that talks

579
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,760
about those font sizes and those logo

580
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,280
placements and all that but if you

581
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,480
forget to that's what your content

582
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,840
review is there for

583
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,159
polls

584
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,918

capacity um

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,360
uh thank you for the updates um i have a

594
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,960
question in terms of

595
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,799
you've mentioned and this is for cat um

596
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,320
you've mentioned about

597
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,960
um submissions of presentations um call

598
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,480
for proposals and things

599
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,640
um have you considered

600
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,120
uh doing other types of content

601
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,520
during the meeting so things like um

602
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,799
poster sessions and things

603
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,000
let's ask the question again like the

604
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,480
posted sessions like those hallway and i

605
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,080
yeah can you oh yeah one more bite i

606
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,440
think i know what you're talking about

607
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,840
yeah so one of the things is that um

608
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,760
with my other hats on

609
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,120
we've looked at

610
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,760
who submits presentations and normally

611
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,520
it's

612
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
generally the same people

613
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,120
and sometimes we find that people are

614
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,360
too shy to present they don't have

615
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,120
presentation styles which keep the

616
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
audience engaged but they have really

617
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,200
good content

618
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,960
and i'm just wondering if doing things

619
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,280
like poster sessions where during the

620
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,880
breaks they can stand next to their

621
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,159
poster

622
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,440
and people can come and ask them

623
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
questions

624
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
it's something to consider yeah we just

625
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,679
haven't thought about it so

626
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,039
the way the program committee is

627
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,280
structured they're self-governing it's a

628
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,039
decision that would be made by the

629
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,280
program committee so it's one of those

630
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,799
things that we would they'll they'll

631
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,960
take this information and feedback to

632
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,559
the program and they'll see if that's

633
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,640
something that seems viable for nano

634
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,400
please please put that in your um

635
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
surveys as well as yeah yeah include

636
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,520
that the program committee will be

637
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,720
reviewing all the surveys that would be

638
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,400
a great phone for us to follow up on for

639
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,440
sure

640
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,120
good suggestion and in the future we

641
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,559
also hope to have a second panel a

642
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,559
second track again um that's just been a

643
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,280
budgetary concern um for this year but

644
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
you know having like a dedicated

645
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,760
tutorials and tracks room is something

646
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,039
that will be coming back in the next

647
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,960
year or so yeah and another thing that

648
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,400
um i think was mentioned earlier in the

649
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,880
conference either by tina or kat

650
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,799
and this refers to what you said dinesh

651
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,799
about whether you're shy or not if

652
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,240
someone feels uncomfortable coming to

653
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,480
the mic you can also use our chat system

654
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,159
to ask questions as well so even though

655
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,919
you're physically here you can use our

656
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,480
chat system to ask a question

657
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,320
you've got a question one one question

658
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,080
from the virtual attendees is why isn't

659
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,000
there a member discount for virtual

660
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,120
attendance

661
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,200
um the reason being is because virtual

662
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,919
attendees have two options one they can

663
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,240
pay a hundred dollars or two they can go

664
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,320
the complimentary route and pay nothing

665
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,640
so to me that's a pretty good discount

666
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,280
so and a voluntary response we got on

667
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,120
the channel was that uh

668
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,200
um you can pay for uh use the free

669
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,640
remote and then if your company was

670
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,440
willing to do a donation exactly exactly

671
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,039
yeah that's an anchor at all

672
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,480
your company will reimburse it great and

673
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,159
if they won't and 100 is too much for

674
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,240
your pockets do the zero exactly we want

675
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,559
to make this content as available as

676
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,720
possible and that's why we've also spent

677
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,960
the energy time and effort to make as

678
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
strong a virtual platform as we have and

679
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,600
even with that we take and post all of

680
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,080

681
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,240
to make this content as accessible as

682
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,840
