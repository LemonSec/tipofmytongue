24th of february the war in ukraine was

86
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,319
started so it was two weeks after the

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,120
war

88
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,319
and

89
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
we got two trucks from a friend of us

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,360
and

91
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
we worked together with a local

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,280
association um in in

93
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
going directly straight to ukraine via

97
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,680
poland it's uh

98
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,000
this war is 900 kilometers from berlin

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,480
away means a border to ukraine it's

100
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,680
very very

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,400
short for us so we have only poland

102
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
between germany and ukraine

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,519

over

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,960
connected and the board of global nog

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,319
alliance

174
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,360
uh yeah you you forgot to mention that

175
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
your wife claudia was not very happy

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
with the full house of

177
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,759
equipment

178
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,960
so we had to find another way and also

179
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
um

180
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,120
some people started asking um

181
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,039
and it's it's a very honest question

182
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,639
they started asking

183
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,800
are you collecting all sort of old

184
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,599
equipment and sending it into ukraine

185
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,120
and we said no

186
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,160
we ask to ukrainian people what they

187
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,520
actually need

188
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
and then we ask the community on the

189
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,599
other side what they can donate and if

190
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,319
there is a match this is what gets into

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,960
into ukraine so there is no

192
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,520
junk piling and sending it into into the

193
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
ukraine we specifically wanted to avoid

194
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
uh this perspective

195
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,520
so the only way how to do this is

196
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,879
we had to build the tool uh so

197
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,120
when things started arriving in

198
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,599
uh we were completely overloaded like

199
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,840
the last message on the team channel was

200
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,560
like two three a.m and then the next

201
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,120
message was six am so we were working

202
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,639
for three weeks

203
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,280
like day and night uh to keep up with

204
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,080
with all the demands and then um

205
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,479
meantime sander stefan he just

206
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,560
disappeared for two days

207
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,680
it was like

208
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,440
no sign from him

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,919
and he he actually started building the

210
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,560
the the whole tool from from the scratch

211
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,199
built for for for these purposes and

212
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,520
here in this tool it's online tool where

213
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
you can self register

214
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,639
uh as a donator or as a recruit as a

215
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,800
requester so people from ukraine our

216
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,759
friends they register as a requesters

217
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,559
and put in exactly what they need

218
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,839
if there is a fiber splicer to to to

219
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,880
fix the network so be it if they need

220
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
servers to uh for example we send couple

221
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,360
of

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
very big powerful servers to uh to make

223
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,240
the infrastructure for their cctld uh

224
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,200
bigger or we as a six connect we are we

225
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,360
have anycast network so we are now

226
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,760
hosting dot ua cctld

227
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
to reinforce their their uh cctld

228
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,399
infrastructure

229
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,839
and um so here this tool

230
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,600
is basically it's on github

231
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,040
it's open source

232
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,839
so

233
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,920
if you need something like this

234
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
hopefully you will never need something

235
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,640
like this if you have a disaster in in

236
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,120
your vicinity you can download this tool

237
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
and fix it up for your for your needs

238
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
and and use it for for uh this and this

239
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
is like you know we went in three weeks

240
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,920
from uh network engineers into uh

241
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,839
uh

242
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,519
demand uh chain managers

243
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,839
um

244
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,800

germany where our volunteer drivers will

261
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,480
put it in a van or a truck

262

and

268
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,160
yeah we are working with our partners in

269
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
ukraine are the ministry of digital

270
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,000
transformation they're good they're

271
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,839
doing a really really great job with the

272
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,000
with the paperwork when our drivers goes

273
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,720
in

274
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,519
uh

275
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,760
with the with the van or with it with

276
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
the truck

277
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,440
on polish side uh they need to wait in

278
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,560
the queue

279
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
uh but when they come to the ukrainian

280
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,240
side they show this paper signed by the

281
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,480
minister and they're like thank you sir

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,839
go

283
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:08,880
um

284
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,600
and then we have this you you uh deps

285
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,480
that's uh that's the platform uh they

286
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,680
they're quite old company to to uh

287
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,240
sells the hardware usual basically but

288
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,079
they were chosen by ukrainian internet

289
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,360
association

290
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,760
as a delivery mechanism inside ukraine

291
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,200
so what we do

292
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,959
we drive this equipment into ukraine

293
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,600
basically sometimes just over the border

294
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
and exchange it at the petrol station

295
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,800
there

296
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
or last time marching drove into lev

297
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,200
into their warehouse where deps got

298
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
the equipment and also a precise list of

299
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
of which equipment goes to which

300
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,000
operator

301
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,519
um

302
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,360
at the end

303
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,200
so one thing one thing um yeah um with

304
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,360
depths it's really cool it's not uh we

305
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,040
not look to this company it was a

306
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,360
recommendation from the ministry of

307
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,800
telecommunication and digital

308
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,959
transformation from the ukrainian

309
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,560
minister

310
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,240
also deb's uh

311
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,399
running business like the last 30 years

312
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,480
in ukraine so for us it's very easy to

313
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
say we have a working working supply

314
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,079
chain minutes we're handing this stuff

315
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,079
over the equipment directly after the

316
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
border to ukraine um these guys have a

317
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,560
warehouse in kiev and also in um lev um

318
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,959
there are the employees are driving with

319
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,440
private crowd cars right now 24 hours

320
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,600
seven days a week to occupied regions

321
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,800
like uh kharkiv etc um

322
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,440
odessa to to handle over stuff right now

323
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,760
we got new information there are right

324
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,160
now um

325
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
at this stage to rebuild also offices

326
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,959
with our delivered access points donated

327
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,959
by a couple of people out of the

328
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,079
community

329
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,600
and yes

330
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,320
you want to follow up or yeah

331
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
so currently the most requested tool are

332
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,600
fiber splicers because

333
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,399
when the bombs come down fiber in the

334
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,639
ground is damaged and usually the

335
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,720
operators have like one fiber splicer

336
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,639
but then 10 people that can use the

337
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,079
fiber splicer

338
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,160
and now they need more fiber splicers so

339
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,000
they can send out

340
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
more people to to to um

341
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,600
to repair the splicers

342
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
um interestingly enough

343
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
when there is no warrior

344
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,760
nobody would think about the second most

345
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,279
requested thing

346
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,600
these are wireless access points

347
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,120
internal ones

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,480
and uh

349
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,600
switches with uh power over ethernet why

350
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
because when there is bombs when there

351
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
is alarm people go into shelters into

352
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,040
bunkers

353
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
and they lose the mobile signal

354
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,519
they they are disconnected from the

355
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,839
world and outside there are bombs coming

356
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:52,639
down

357
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,480
so now they are mounting the wireless

358
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,040
access points inside the bunkers inside

359
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,519
the shelters so people

360
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,839
can be connected to the rest of the

361
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,240
world and maybe call the family and say

362
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,639
okay we are okay outside bombs are

363
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,959
coming down but we are fine

364
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,680
it's a little bit easier to to to go

365
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
through this experience if you're not

366
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
entirely disconnected

367
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,279
yeah

368
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,720
would you like to comment on this one

369
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,560

383
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,279
see

384
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,079
like uh how important the internet is in

385
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,959
ukraine right now to use a couple of

386
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,720
messaging uh

387
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
possibilities or apps so

388
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,199
telegram topped the shots with

389
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,079
50

390
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
54 000 new installs in two weeks britify

391
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,639
was increased silo it's also

392
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,240
increased massive increase of the

393
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,880
downloads and signal also

394
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,560
and the thing

395
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,040
how important is also the internet in in

396
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,600
ukraine after the war started that you

397
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,760
can see here the download ratio was

398
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,240
increasing massively increasing for cnn

399
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,639
on fox news applications for android and

400
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,800
also for for ios

401
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
so

402
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,279
it's a massive massive massive important

403
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,199
thing to rebuild the ukrainian

404
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,199
infrastructure also ukraine was one of

405
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,079
the leaders for for electronical payment

406
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,560
and right now it looks in a western part

407
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
of ukraine good but in the eastern part

408
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,399
in south eastern part not so really good

409
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,800
and here you can see some

410
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120

shares with these people they're totally

429

we appreciate it too and here

433
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,320
temperatures are sub-zero yeah

434
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,199
and

435
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,320
this is all best this is also a local

436
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,240
isp

437
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,160
this is a broken bridge

438
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,759
and there are

439
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,680
pulling this fiber new over the bricks

440
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,360
to say okay we need this connectivity

441
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,480
done

442

we will do it on a better way later

443
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,760
i'm happy they're restoring this uh uh

444

to collect some

455
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,480

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,360
we

461
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
loaded also the first place of the

462
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,799
ukraine then back to check

463
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,760
poland and ukraine poland germany back

465
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,600
kilometers and driving time was 44 hours

466
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,520
80 kilometers per hour

467
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,880
it's really cool at the highway so this

468
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
is uh when i was collecting some

469
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,679
equipment that saw some friends and this

470
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,160
is a one of my ex-employer b6 commercial

471
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,280
internet exchange in berlin a

472
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
technical university in berlin they

473
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,080
donated i think 280 switches

474
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,960
um

475
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,200
yes and this is what what uh

476
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,280
jan mentioned is empty house happy wife

477
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,240
she was really happy when

478
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,679
she hasn't seen any switches so

479
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
uh some pics from our friends in the

480
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,880
czech republic uh with sergey and

481
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,400
we met also uh adam during um a break on

482
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,240
a gas station he handled over antennas

483
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
and all this stuff and only for a record

484
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,679
it's one one one my craziest experience

485
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,280
is when you're driving a truck with two

486
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,039
and a half completely over normally

487
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,200
overloaded but i've seen it

488
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,120
on the scale in ukraine

489
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,039
um

490
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,799
when you when you when you're driving up

491
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,960
a hill or a mountain you need to think

492
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,679
about you can have here 80 degrees but

493
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,400
upside on the top it can be minus

494
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
degrees or whatever and um also you need

495
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,440
to go down on the other side so um we

496
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,080
have fully functional highways please

497
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
yes but zagre decided we skipped the

498
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
grad sideway and that's the reason we

499
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
crossed the alps on the straight bay so

500
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,960
this gives world huh yeah it's not my

501
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,440
fault so this is we are loading the

502
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,000
first place for ukraine in slovenia and

503
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,720
all in it was this uh trip was like 40

504
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,640
pellets over two tons

505
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,880
uh uh with our first batch to ukraine um

506
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,960
i think they said it was worth over half

507
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,120
a million yes 480 520 000 yeah so this

508
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,679
