we will have uh alternating um

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,080
presentation from from remote and in

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
room so the first part should be more of

56
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,640
a retrospective

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,680
uh as you all well known 10 years ago

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,239
uh we did this a world ipv6 day well

59
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,720
that was 11 years ago when we switched

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,599
on ipv6 for one day and then switched it

61
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,920
off some people left it on and then the

62
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,400
year later on on 6th of june

63
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
we had this world's ipv6 launch

64
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
which was destined and

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,879
the purpose was to basically switch on

66
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,400
ipv6 and leave it on for good

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,160
so i would like to ask let's see who's

68
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,680
who's first

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,400
is it jason

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,800
yeah jason please uh in five minutes if

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,480
you can describe um what what you did

72
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,319
back then and

73
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,239
what happened up to this moment um sure

74
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,120
um 10 years ago i was working for yahoo

75
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,319
at the time

76
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,159
uh the days

77
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,080
months a couple years leading up to the

78
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
world ipv6 day event

79
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,800
um internet society got all of us into a

80
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,720
room they kept saying

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,640
figure out how to make ipv6 move forward

82
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
or we're not letting you out

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,319
i blame phil roberts for that um

84
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,440
and

85
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,599
there the resistance to this uh as we

86
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,480
heard earlier was the brokenness problem

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,400
uh turns out it is a small number

88
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,680
0.05 percent of the users had

89
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,120
ibv6 configured but misconfigured

90
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,440
or transit was broken or just something

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
wasn't right and the kernel didn't know

92
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,959
that it was going to work and so

93
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,200
connections would try to connect

94
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,959
stall

95
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,720
and from a user perspective the site was

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,840
down

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,920
none of us really wanted what turned out

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,400
to be a million users

99
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,519
unable to reach unable to get to their

100
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,920
favorite content to complain about it

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
and go to the competition

102
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,560
uh with isaac's help we came up the idea

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,560
of the world ipv6 day

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,720
uh where we basically all agreed let's

105
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
jump off the ledge together

106
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,919
um

107
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
user won't be able to reach yahoo won't

108
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,880
be able to reach google won't be able to

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,919
go to facebook to complain about it

110
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,440
maybe they'll see there's this hint that

111
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,040
maybe there's something wrong on their

112
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,240
end

113
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
um

114
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,680
moving forward the v6 uh

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,919
day was coming up

116
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,759
those was their content providers all

117
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,840
ran campaigns to detect the users that

118
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,759
are broken to

119
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,440
put up some type of messaging to them

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
and say hey we know that you're going to

121
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,199
have a problem on this particular day

122
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,960
click here to learn more

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
and the campaign worked pretty well it

124
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,800
dropped the brokenness from the .05

125
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,960
small number to a much more manageable

126
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
point zero two leading up to the actual

127
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
switch

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,080
the day was pretty good mostly

129
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,080
uneventful other than watching lots of

130
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
graphs there were you know a few hiccups

131
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,280
here and there that everyone had but for

132
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,199
the most part

133
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,080
we weren't fired

134
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,039
um and the internet didn't melt down

135
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,000
yeah uh so

136
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,479
uh world ip6

137
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,120
launch came about next year

138
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
uh the numbers were small enough that

139
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,479
everybody was happy signing off and

140
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:35,840
saying yes we know we're gonna have this

141
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,479
impact on this number of users

142
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,440
we got to move forward

143
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,520
coming from a slightly different

144
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
perspective i run this little site

145
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,758
called testipv6.com

146
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,000
one of its jobs is just detect broken

147
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,880
users in fact it's only job really and

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,280
that might be because of mtu or any

149
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
other issues

150
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,199
and one thing i've seen in the last 10

151
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,639
years is

152
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,520
you know ahead of the launch we had uh

153
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,639
something like three percent of the

154
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,600
users

155
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,960
not the point zero five but three

156
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
percent of those who came to the site

157
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,560
had problems that we were able to say

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,280
hey

159
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
you are going to break

160
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
and

161
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,120
by the time the v6 launch came around

162
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
those numbers were down to about point

163
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,000
zero i'm sorry about point six

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,080
still much bigger than

165
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,000
what the broad numbers were because

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,120
these people are the ones that said i

167
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,520
might have a problem let's go look

168
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,199
and then over the following couple years

169
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,600
things went down to about point two

170
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
it stayed there until about two years

171
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,759
ago and it's actually been rising back

172
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,600
up since about point seven

173
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
looking at the numbers i've only been

174
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,840
able to look at the stats for the last

175
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,720
couple weeks because of gdpr data

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
reasons

177
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
uh

178
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,400
unusual amounts of interest coming from

179
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,440
china

180
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,840
japan

181
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,280
brazil an order of magnitude higher

182
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,560
amount of interest coming from those

183
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,639
locations compared to

184
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,639
what maybe jeff houston's stats would

185
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
show from ap nick

186
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,560
looking a little bit closer

187
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
i was kind of expecting maybe it was

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
china that would have the most

189
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
brokenness because of

190
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
technical political boundary issues

191
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,160
uh actually no they were only 0.2

192
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,759
percent broken

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
it was actually japan at uh two and a

194
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,639
half percent

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,440
why two and a half percent today

196
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,880
i don't know i don't know if it's the

197
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
walled garden issue still rearing its

198
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,759
head or what they do have a high amount

199
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,039
of v6 deployed but can't quite explain

200
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,039
all of it

201
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,560
it sounds scary

202
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,199
the reality is that happy eyeballs did

203
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
save the internet as far as i'm

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,000
concerned

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,840
uh happy eyeballs

206
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,120
uh

207
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
for those that don't know it just

208
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,960
basically says run one connection

209
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
after a certain amount of time run a

210
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
second connection let them race and

211
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,400
remember which one wins

212
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,039
uh that has evolved over time we had

213
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
well backing up we had implementations

214
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,319
in chrome and firefox on the day of the

215
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,680
launch we also had os level support in

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,879
apple's mac os and ios

217
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,840
since then curl has added support which

218
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,879
is great for scripting languages

219
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,199
and

220
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,759
apple sent or posted an updated

221
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,520
algorithm for happy eyeballs to help

222
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,680
reduce the appearance of latency for the

223
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,120
user

224
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
so today nobody really knows since

225
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,799
they're broken until both protocols are

226
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
broken which is cool

227
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,399
but we do still have some troubles that

228
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,320
we need to resolve

229
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,399
thank you jason and thank you very much

230
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,800
for test

231
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,480
ipv6.com this is really really useful

232
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
stuff and helped help to debug many many

233
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,080
many cases i remember the meeting when

234
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,560
it was created yeah

235
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
and when we we wrote a document how to

236
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,839
use it

237
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,240
as a write document that was cool

238
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,200
all right uh let's let's move forward uh

239
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,760
eric nygren is recorded do we have a

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,080
recording thank you very much if you can

241
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,399
hello my name is eric nigrin and i'm a

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,240
fellow and chief architect at akamai

243
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
technologies

244
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
i've been at akamai for almost 23 years

245
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,640
now as a large content delivery network

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
akamai has long been committed to

247
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,160
helping our customers with a smooth

248
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,560
transition to ipv6

249
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
as of the world ipv6 launch event a

250
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
decade ago akamai already had over a

251
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
thousand customer dual stacked host

252
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,760
names on our platform

253
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,000
over the past 10 years we've seen a

254
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,320
dramatic increase in ipv6 traffic on our

255
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,519
platform over a thousand decks

256
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,160
peak pv6 traffic increased from around a

257
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,959
gigabit 10 years ago to recent daily

258
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,120
peaks of over 41 terabits per second

259
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,440
we've gone from serving just shy of four

260
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
billion requests per day over ipv6 uh

261
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
ten years ago to now regularly serving a

262
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
thousand times that at four trillion

263
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,839
ipv6 requests per day

264
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,800
while we previously observed 19 million

265
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,440
ipv6 addresses per day on world ipv6

266
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,399
launch

267
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,079
we now see around 7.5 billion ipv6

268
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,200
addresses in a typical day including

269
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,920
around 2.2 billion

270
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
ipv6 64 prefixes one way we've been

271
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,600
measuring the adoption of ipv6 has been

272
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,920
to look at the ratio of ipv6 requests to

273
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,640
total requests on subsets of our dual

274
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,880
stacked customer sites

275
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,720
it's worth noting that the typical

276
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,279
traffic club customer traffic mix

277
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,120
including a set of devices customer

278
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
traffic type and end user isp can

279
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
heavily influence aggregate numbers

280
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
which is why we haven't been reporting a

281
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,120
single global number

282
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,760
looking at the top 10 global economies

283
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,720
all but two of ipv6 adoption levels in

284
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,320
the 35

285
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,399
to 62 percent range

286
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,079
and china while which was starting out

287
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,640
with very little ipv6 10 years ago in

288
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,240
the past few years has

289
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
seen substantial growth and now we see

290
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,720
around uh ipv6 adoption levels are

291
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
around 25 percent growth in individual

292
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,279
countries is very much a function of the

293
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,040
individual network providers within

294
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
those within those countries most of the

295
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,920
largest networks in the world have have

296
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
significant ipv6 adoption

297
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,800
around half of the top 100 network

298
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,120
providers have ipv6 adoption over 40

299
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
percent measuring top n by the number of

300
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,000
total requests served on dual stacked

301
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,240
host names looking at the top 800

302
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,320
networks only around a fifth of them

303
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
have ipv6 adoption over 40 percent and

304
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,760
this continues to decline from there

305
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,399
a real challenge we face going forward

306
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
is to convince these smaller and more

307
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,040
slowly growing networks to deploy ipv6

308
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,560
even if they have less of a need for it

309
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,920
themselves

310
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,760
otherwise we face a real risk of a

311
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,000
fragmented internet split between large

312
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,120
ipv6 centric networks and small ipv4

313
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,040
only networks akamai has had ipv4 ipv6

314
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
dual stack as a default for new customer

315
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,760
configurations for quite a few years now

316
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,680
and we encourage customers to dual stack

317
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,240
existing configurations

318
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
many of our customers are large

319
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,920
enterprises or other complex businesses

320
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,160
that have handling end-user ipv ip

321
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,600
addresses deeply embedded in their

322
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,839
workflows meaning we can't forcibly

323
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,680
enable ipv6 for them without breaking

324
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
things

325
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,040
with this we've still seen substantial

326
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,279
uptake in ipv6 on the content delivery

327
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,399
side

328
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,079
of those customer host names serving

329
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,160
over 1 million requests per day

330
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,839
over 40 percent of them are now dual

331
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,839
stacked and this continues to grow

332
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,079
steadily with many of our largest high

333
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,639
volume customers are now mostly dual

334
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,600
stacked

335
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,360
we've even seen cases during large

336
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
events with the majority of all traffic

337
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
we're serving to some large countries

338
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
over ipv6

339
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
and this seems like it'll be

340
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,800
increasingly common

341
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,880
thank eric um

342
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,160
matthew

343
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,920
what's your story

344
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,680
yeah our story is actually one that's

345
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
coincidental with nanogs that have been

346
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,920
held in canada so this is kind of cool

347
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,680
my very first nadal was actually not on

348
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,120
55 held in vancouver in 2012 i think

349
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
everyone descended upon vancouver that

350
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,600
year

351
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,200
two years after the olympics so i think

352
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,399
that year was like

353
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,399
there was an erin meeting there

354
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,800
followed by a nanog followed by an ietf

355
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,600
so

356
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,360
lots happening in in vancouver and it

357
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,480
was actually

358
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,079
it was coincidental as well with world

359
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,120
ipv6 launch uh june 6th fell on on one

360
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,360
of those days at nanawg in vancouver

361
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,279
and we did not have the one percent

362
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,800
required to have our

363
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
our name checked off as one of the

364
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,079
service providers participating in the

365
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,920
launch but we were participating in

366
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,079
other ways doing testing and enabling

367
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,480
our our website

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,440
so

369
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,959
it actually took us a few more years to

370
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,399
get our our uh residential base going

371
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:55,920
toward v6

372
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
and actually it was uh nano 65 the last

373
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,639
time was in montreal

374
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,519
and my colleague clinton presented for

375
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
the audience here about tell us his

376
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,320
experience

377
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,639
deploying ipv6 at scale

378
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,880
so um yeah i'd say basically if i look

379
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,920
at the story of telus and and how to

380
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
categorize our customers certainly

381
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,760
there's a difference between wireless

382
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,279
and wireline

383
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,519
we have done some of the the t-mobile

384
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
playbook of doing v6

385
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,040
and providing v4 over 464 xlat it's the

386
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,880
whole idea of v4 as a service i think

387
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,880
that is definitely

388
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,839
the future and and i have to

389
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,920
say that i am biased that way because

390
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,720
one of the jobs i do in my day job is is

391
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,959
the v4 address management and v6 address

392
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
management the v6 address management is

393
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,800
much much easier

394
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,120
v4 address management of course is a

395
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,720
somewhat stressful job these days trying

396
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
to come up with the addresses for even

397
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,519
private ips on a wireless network with

398
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,279
10 million subscribers that's that's not

399
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,880
a trivial task

400
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,120
rfc 1918 doesn't quite have enough and

401
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
and even with 65.98 thrown in there

402
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,079
so more and more i'd like to see the

403
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,800
idea of v6 as as you know the default

404
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,440
for sure in the mobile space

405
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
on wireline we've got sort of two main

406
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,000
buckets i would say so residential

407
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,839
uh as mentioned we did scale it up in

408
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,199
2015

409
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,920
and today that is the default so v6 by

410
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,079
default and more and more we're going to

411
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
be introducing

412
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
cgn in order to help scale up v4s we add

413
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
customers

414
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,600
and then the other piece is the the

415
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
business side so business you know it's

416
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,920
been talked about we heard it from scott

417
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,600
the enterprise space is a bit more

418
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,680
challenged by inertia and staff being

419
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,199
unfamiliar

420
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,519
and one of our design choices in

421
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,759
deploying v6 or at least making it

422
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,839
capable of that

423
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,600
we decided that the provisioning system

424
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,000
shouldn't you know by default give v6

425
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,839
addresses we want enterprises to

426
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,920
basically ask for it and i would say an

427
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
analogy is

428
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,040
you know people in the air community

429
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,800
have talked about the idea of giving v6

430
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,560
by default to any org id that's out

431
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,600
there

432
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,040
but it's not clear that that's actually

433
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
going to have an impact on on people

434
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,800
deploying v6 and using it

435
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,480
so to me uh

436
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,920
you know that's our choice i i'd be

437
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,519
happy to have a debate with with anyone

438
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,040
or or discussion and hear your thoughts

439
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,839
about should we push v6 by default to

440
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,600
enterprise customers

441
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,440
i think it's worth talking about and i'm

442
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,279
sure uh my panel fellow panelists have

443
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,920
some things to say about that

444
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,399
thank you very much uh

445
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,279
well ipv6 by default on or not we will

446
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,800
have a discussion after the

447
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,000
retrospective uh parts uh to continue

448
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
the discussion that john had with with

449
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:37,839
with vint

450
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,160
um would would like to hear now from ron

451
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,519
breuer's mind we have a recording right

452
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
hi i'm ron berisma chief engineer of the

453
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,759
defense research and engineering network

454
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,399
or dren and going to give some

455
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,480
perspective on the world ipv6 launch

456
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,079
from 10 years ago

457
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,959
and the state of ipv6 at the time

458
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,440
dran was an earlier early adopter of

459
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,759
ipv6 so by the time of world ipv6 launch

460
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,240
our backbone was already dual stack for

461
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,760
at least a decade

462
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,439
all of our public-facing services were

463
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,679
google stack this was part of compliance

464
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,000
with an earlier federal mandate

465
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,679
and all our management networks were

466
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,199
ipv6 only

467
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,760
and so there wasn't a lot to do in terms

468
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,359
of contributing to the launch by turning

469
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
on something new because everything was

470
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
pretty much turned on that was external

471
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
facing but we did participate in

472
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
monitoring and testing as

473
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,679
the launch was happening

474
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,160
some of the issues we had at the time 10

475
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,039
years ago a lot of it was with industry

476
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,400
products

477
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,000
one of the big issues was lack of

478
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,360
feature parity

479
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,200
because what worked in ipv4 didn't

480
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
always work in ipv6 which really

481
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,120
impacted our ipv6 only operations due to

482
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,200
loss of functionality for the things

483
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,039
that didn't work in v6 you just lost

484
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,480
those functions so that was a huge

485
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,679
problem

486
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,280
another problem was lack of code

487
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,559
maturity

488
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,200
and you think about it with ipv4 at the

489
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
time we had at least 30 years plus of

490
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,960
mature code but with v6 it was only a

491
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
few years and so there's lots of bugs

492
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:09,919
we're still finding them and there's

493
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
certainly more to be found

494
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,720
we had some major meltdowns due to bugs

495
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,360
and so that was our biggest issue in

496
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,799
terms of risk

497
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,720
another problem with vendors

498
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,480
in trying to understand why they weren't

499
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,520
implementing

500
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
ipv6 in their products

501
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
we found out that they were not eating

502
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,559
their own dog food so they weren't

503
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,880
finding out about the issues themselves

504
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
and their qa processes didn't include

505
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,520
ipv6 and so

506
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,440
um they were not even addressing ipb6

507
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,400
bugs

508
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,440
as bugs but instead when they arose they

509
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,880
treat it as a feature request which

510
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,799
sometimes took years to

511
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,000
resolve and so when asked we

512
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,840
said why isn't

513
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,919
this being addressed at a higher

514
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,440
priority they said well nobody's using

515
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,240
ipv6 anyway and so there was no real

516
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,000
corporate committed ipv6 or most of

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,240
those companies

518
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
some internal issues that we were

519
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,000
addressing at the time

520
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,600
our own internal organizations and

521
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,840
customers of vran had a lack of

522
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,240
incentive to enable ipv6 we could tell

523
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,799
them set mandates try to enforce it but

524
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,200
they had lots of excuses things like oh

525
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,039
it's very expensive and so we need more

526
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,520
money or we think it's less secure or it

527
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
has lower performance

528
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,360
and other urgent activities always seem

529
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,880
to take precedence such as security

530
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,080
compliance

531
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,400
and the mandates just really didn't help

532
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,960
very much as you all know there were

533
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
many mandates over the years and it

534
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,400
really did very little to move the

535
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,679
needle

536
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,240
but when world ipv6 launch came along

537
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,840
besides just enabling a lot of the

538
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,640
content providers the

539
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
search providers the

540
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,360
social media content

541
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,799
it had some side effects that we

542
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,360
observed and that the argument about

543
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,039
nobody using it was no longer valid

544
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,360
because a lot of people were using ipv6

545
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,559
and the increased demand

546
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,880
of ipv6 really signaled industry that

547
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,200
they needed to include full ipv6 support

548
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,559
or the companies were going to die

549
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,559
because their competitors would win out

550
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,320
and as more people were using it more

551
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
people were discovering bugs and

552
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,640
pressuring for fixes which improved code

553
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,280
maturity which just helped the entire

554
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,480
community

555
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,320
and also a lot of the internal excuses

556
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
about cost security performance really

557
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
proved to be without merit because if it

558
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:27,360
was good for

559
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,320
the many

560
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,480
major providers and they weren't having

561
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,919
issues with that then that couldn't be

562
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,520
used as an excuse so it really helped

563
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,159
break the log jam in our internal

564
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,559
organizations as the excuses went away

565
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,679
and they'd be able to move forward

566
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,559
so still today what we're noticing some

567
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,440
of those same problems still exist

568
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,600
but as i observe in the federal

569
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,280
government the federal networks there's

570
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,520
still a lack of incentive

571
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,320
and we can easily get bogged down in

572
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,440
bureaucracy and other excuses and lots

573
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,280
of planning and

574
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,039
sometimes can go on for years without

575
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,919
ever passing the single life 86 packet

576
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,360
and what we also found is there's not

577
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,200
much progress unless there's a strong

578
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,720
internal incentive within an

579
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,039
organization with total corporate

580
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,080
support

581
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,440
and at ipv6 culture so having that

582
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,600
internal advocacy is really important so

583
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,720
we see a lot of difference between

584
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,480
different federal agencies some very

585
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,159
successful and some not doing much at

586
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:24,960
all

587
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,640
but inside the department of defense for

588
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,679
the ones that have not yet enabled ipv6

589
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,679
our message is don't be afraid to break

590
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,880
some glass just turn it on

591
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
because all the other excuses and

592
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
arguments are just a waste of time at

593
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,360
this point

594
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
for drin

595
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,960
how we incentivize

596
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
the industry and also our own internal

597
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,760
uh customers is we do not buy anything

598
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,960
from a company that doesn't have a

599
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,520
corporate commitment to ipv6

600
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,840
so for example if they lack an ipv6

601
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,159
enabled website that indicates a lack of

602
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,679
corporate commitment and we will not do

603
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,600
business with those companies

604
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
we also turn ibv6 on by default wherever

605
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,440
possible if you're a drin subscriber and

606
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,720
there are many hundreds you cannot

607
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,480
connect to dram unless you are dual

608
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,440
stack

609
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,000
and that is enforced and we monitor it

610
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,720
if your ipv6 bgp session goes down we

611
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,799
set out alerts and make you fix it

612
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,520
we remove ipv4 wherever we can which

613
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,679
isn't as many places as we would like

614
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,159
we'd love to turn it off altogether

615
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,960
but there's just too much other legacy

616
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,440
and external stuff that's requires v4

617
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,520
and is before only so we can't do that

618
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,600
yet but another incentive is we try to

619
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,159
make it a security issue which does help

620
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,720
progress a lot because if we make that

621
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,799
part of security compliance then v6 gets

622
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,720
turned on so we've done that a number of

623
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,559
places very successfully

624
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,720
some of the continuing challenges are

625
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,520
new bugs in mainstream products we have

626
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,840
a major firewall vendor that we've been

627
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,720
fighting a bug for the last three four

628
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,640
months and it turned out to be an ipv6

629
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,720
bug internally and this was

630
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,679
a bug that was introduced in a recent

631
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,679
version of a very mainstream vendor

632
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,159
product so they're still popping up

633
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,480
there's also new products with no ipv6

634
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
support at all recently just a few days

635
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,880
ago talked to a vendor evaluating a very

636
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,240
new product looked very exciting and

637
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,159
then we asked the ipv6 question and well

638
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,240
sorry we haven't done that yet so that

639
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,080
still happens a lot and then a big one

640
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,039
for us is ipv6 in the cloud gov cloud in

641
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,720
particular where

642
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,760
the ipv6 rollout is just not mature for

643
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,919
many of the cloud service providers

644
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,280
so uh

645
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,520
in summary i think we need another ipv6

646
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,200
day of some sort we need to reach

647
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,559
critical mass we need more of the

648
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,120
internet to be v6 enabled i need to be

649
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,600
able to turn off v4 and so whatever we

650
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,679
can do to get there would be great so

651
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,000
thank you very much

652
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,200
thank you ron

653
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,039
ron was always famous for chasing

654
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,880
vendors to fix ipv6 bugs well done

655
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,360
yeah madura what happened in your world

656
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
in the last 10 years in ipv6 uh great

657
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,400
question um i'm this is called the

658
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
reunion tour i am i am on a union tour

659
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,960
this is my first time at nanog um really

660
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,480
excited to be here 10 years ago i was um

661
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,760
actually working

662
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,120
working at cisco systems uh testing ipv6

663
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,760
for comcast so i was probably somewhere

664
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,080
a little minion helping helping your

665
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,520
cause john um and fast forward ten years

666
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,520
later uh i now work at aws um as a

667
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,279
manager product team that focuses on our

668
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,320
ipv6 roadmap but um let me talk about

669
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,559
what cloud has done in the last 10 years

670
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,159
um with with ipv6 uh the first time we

671
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,240
launched for i might i might go through

672
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
some basic cloud things so please pardon

673
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,799
me if you already know them

674
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,000
we started aws with with two primary

675
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,960
services s3 which is our storage service

676
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
and ec2 which is our compute service um

677
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,960
in 2009 is when we launched something

678
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
called virtual private cloud which is

679
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,960
like a little wrapper around your ec2

680
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,559
that says okay now you're in a private

681
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,200
network and you can use rfc 1918 space

682
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
in there um

683
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,159
then in obviously a few years later 2016

684
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,279
is when

685
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,200
we we started building services that are

686
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,080
load balancers we built route 53 which

687
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,720
is our dns service we built cloudfront

688
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,039
our content delivery network and we

689
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,679
realized that hey our network that is

690
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,919
now facing the internet no longer a

691
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,799
private network needs to have v6 uh so

692
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,720
2016 we did a barrage of every

693
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
service known then that faced the

694
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,679
internet uh supported ipv6 so all the

695
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,000
services that i named along with several

696
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,240
others anything that is on the edge of

697
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,679
your network can uh support v6

698
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:48,640
um

699
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,159
and we thought you know we did a good

700
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,559
job we gave ourselves a pat on the back

701
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,080
uh and as uh matt said earlier it's it's

702
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,520
an enterprise world uh we've handed

703
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,400
folks ipv6 and they've said hey you can

704
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,720
turn this on now on your network

705
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
um

706
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,960
that was 2016 early 2017.

707
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
um now in the last two three years

708
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,880
however we've changed we've seen the

709
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,919
landscape or our customers needs change

710
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,880
um in what we now hear from our

711
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,960
customers that run very very large

712
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,679
networks is

713
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,279
the internet scarcity of ipv4 isn't

714
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:32,240
as big a challenge for them as it is to

715
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,120
run their private networks using unique

716
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,799
rfc 1918 space um so if you if you look

717
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,200
up our our uh some of our customer

718
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,039
references they'll talk about how they

719
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,520
use natting in their private network i

720
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,840
have a sticker now from someone at nanak

721
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,679
that said less not more v6 and i i i

722
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,159
took some for my team uh

723
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,640
also but but we have customers that are

724
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,400
running out of space within their

725
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,480
private network setup uh whether it's

726
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,240
their virtual private cloud or their

727
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,799
extended uh entire on-premise network

728
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,559
with their data centers branch offices

729
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,480
etc

730
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,200
and then coming with technology that is

731
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,440
a few years ago serverless and then

732
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,520
containers we

733
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,559
basically had our customers

734
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,399
use up their ip space

735
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,919
uh in their vpcs pretty quickly um so

736
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,080
anything that we have done now it is

737
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,960
since

738
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,480
2016 2017 is to help their applications

739
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,159
whatever our customer enterprises are

740
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,600
building turn that to v6 so now if you

741
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,320
look at um now if you look at a simple

742
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
three tier architecture you have a web

743
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,600
tier app tier uh database now on aws you

744
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
could build all of that load balancer

745
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,520
compute

746
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,840
database services you can build all of

747
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,960
that as as dual stack um so you could

748
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,240
build those architectures and

749
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,360
applications using ipv6 end-to-end where

750
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,039
your v6 only client could be

751
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,720
communicating with all of that without

752
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,600
translation needed

753
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,440
and on the other side for for these

754
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,440
customers running containers what we've

755
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,960
built is

756
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,559
a couple of areas where we've actually

757
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,039
built v6 only support

758
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,120
one is just on pure ec2 so you can

759
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,679
actually spin up an ac2 instance today

760
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,039
that with an only a v6 address uh and

761
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,200
we've also built support for

762
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,840
v6 only on our kubernetes service our

763
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,880
managed kubernetes service uh it we did

764
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,039
we did a cool thing where there's an

765
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,679
implicit nat going out to

766
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,679
upstream world where v6 is not yet

767
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,000
supported in kubernetes but you can run

768
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,559
pods on uh on aws

769
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,360
uh kubernetes pods on aws without using

770
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,399
v4 um so that's that's been our journey

771
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,039
so far excellent and we will talk later

772
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,520
about ipv6 home by default right

773
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,080
we oh we did we did that yes sorry uh

774
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,399
thank you for the reminder uh we did do

775
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,679
that with one of our smaller services so

776
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,600
this is not enterprise this is our

777
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,679
service called amazon light sale it's

778
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,480
also an aws service it basically does a

779
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,120
virtual private server so web hosting

780
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,640
lightweight applications that you want

781
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,520
to build

782
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,039
quick and dirty

783
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,200
so these are not enterprises that use

784
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,760
this as smaller companies and when we

785
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,720
enabled ipv6 for light sale in 2020

786
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,559
january i think um we

787
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,960
we turned it on by default so now all

788
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,279
light sail instances are dual stacked by

789
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,000
default um we did have a couple of

790
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,159
issues um

791
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
we were able to fix them there's uh some

792
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,120
additional documentation you you'll find

793
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,000
on our website to add additional config

794
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
to make it work fully because there's

795
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,840
some software packages that the instance

796
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,360
like if you're trying to

797
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,200
host a certain type of application you

798
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
need to download software packages from

799
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,760
destinations that may not work

800
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,600
completely so there's additional

801
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,799
additional config added but um

802
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,120
no no issues so far i think we should

803
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,880
move this part of discussion into the

804
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,880
next uh

805
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,480
now it's good because now we we need to

806
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,720
hear from from from from facebook and

807
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,640
paul saab do we have a recording

808
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,320
so i'm paul

809
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,159
i've been to facebook for about 14 and a

810
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,679
half years

811
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,120
and

812
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,919
i along with a handful of people worked

813
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,159
on the launch of e6

814
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,919
for the public internet about 10 years

815
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,760
ago

816
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,760
you know since that time you know we've

817
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
talked about publicly the work that we

818
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,440
have done with v6 and most famously

819
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,320
was time that i disclosed that we had

820
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,080
converted all of our infrastructure

821
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,679
internally

822
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,039
to b6

823
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,399
that process

824
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,600
took us

825
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,159
approximately about 18 months

826
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,799
and it was fraught with many many big

827
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,559
problems

828
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,799
we had to get the switch vendors to fix

829
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,000
their bugs

830
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,279
we had to fix linux and other operating

831
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,799
system bugs

832
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,200
we had to work around bugs in various

833
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,240
libraries and software

834
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,760
that we had either written internally or

835
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,360
you were using the open source

836
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,480
we had to figure out logging mechanisms

837
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,559
we had to figure out abuse mechanisms

838
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,640
there was you know quite a bit of work

839
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,960
and at times we felt like you know this

840
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,360
project may not work

841
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,480
but

842
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,320
at the end of 2014 we launched our first

843
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,480
internal data center as an e6000 case

844
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
and you know we thought we were ready

845
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,120
and when we tried to start taking

846
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,559
traffic

847
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,840
it uh

848
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
didn't work because we didn't actually

849
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,240
find everything that was communicating

850
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,640
over v4 because

851
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,760
the

852
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,519
infrastructure we had in place

853
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,600
was not able to detect the miniscule

854
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,200
amounts of before that was still being

855
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,480
served

856
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
but you know we rolled up our sleeves we

857
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,120
continued to work and a few weeks later

858
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,360
we launched the first ever

859
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,840
v6 only data center infrastructure

860
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,360
and today

861
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,320
really the only v4 space that

862
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,120
exists in our data centers is to support

863
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,880
public-facing internet instruction

864
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,519
so since that time when we finished

865
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,159
all of the work for internally

866
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,039
we

867
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,279
we've made it our mission to make sure

868
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,720
that everything that we launched is

869
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,399
still stack

870
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,159
we have

871
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,279
pushed

872
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,080
our

873
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,799
facebook caches out to the world

874
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,519
and we try to encourage all of our isps

875
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,480
that use these devices to use v6

876
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,200
and we will fill over recents

877
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,120
um we

878
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,440
we really have embraced the v6 first

879
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,799
strategy

880
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:51,519
um i won't say it's been easy um and i

881
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,080
won't lie to you that there are some

882
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,760
you know building management systems out

883
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,399
there

884
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,519
and

885
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,440
other very esoteric

886
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,600
pieces of equipment that still have

887
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,200
migraine

888
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,840
and but we continue to push on this

889
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,640
uh constantly and try to

890
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,640
encourage the world to shift to these

891
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,240
things

892
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,760
um

893
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,399
we have you know launched v6 uh

894
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,720
networking at scale conferences uh we

895
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,320
held a couple of those

896
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,960
we've published data on

897
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,159
facebook.com ipv6 where you can track

898
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:27,279
how

899
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,200
v6 traffic is

900
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,519
growing over time on

901
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,120
facebook

902
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,240
we

903
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,440
continue to monitor new isps that are

904
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,679
coming online with v6

905
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,799
and

906
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,919
you know most recently uh verizon fios

907
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,720
has finally started to deploy v6 and as

908
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,159
of today

909
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,760
they have gone

910
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,440
you know from the beginning of the

911
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,279
actually from their rollout starting in

912
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,200
about april they have gone from about

913
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,519
two percent to eight percent probably by

914
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,480
the time

915
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,159
we actually host this panel they'll be

916
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,159
well on their way to over ten percent of

917
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,360
their traffic

918
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,880
uh that's pretty exciting news because

919
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,799
people have been asking verizon since

920
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,119
the launch for v6

921
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,480
and uh

922
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
maybe they were doing this in

923
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,719
anticipation of uh

924
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,040
this anniversary but you know we still

925
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,800
have a long way to go there's still many

926
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,760
many large isps in the united states

927
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,199
that do not

928
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,119
support these things

929
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,040
but we continue to encourage them we

930
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,320
continue to

931
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,800
push them

932
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,199
i wish they were more like all the

933
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,800
mobile operators you know in the united

934
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,960
states we see about 90 of all mobile

935
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,800
traffic

936
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
so you know we've come quite a long way

937
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,079
to seeing the world you know embrace and

938
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,760
grow on v6

939
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
today globally

940
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,199
33

941
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,040
of our traffic to the internet is over

942
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,079
v6

943
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,159
um i would like that to be higher but

944
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,040
you know in the united

945
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,880
is blowing away states world with you

946
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,320
know

947
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,720
reliance jio as well over 90 percent of

948
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,760
iraq's jio's traffic 46 and india

949
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,320
serves up the most v6 bits on the planet

950
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,839
these days

951
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:18,079
so you know for us

952
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,760
we believe that we can't scale the

953
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,280
internet without v6 we believe that

954
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,079
e6 growth is super healthy

955
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,839
and

956
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,880
we are here to help any isp that wants

957
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,839
to

958
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,440
make sure that their rollout is going

959
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,480
well we

960
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,880
can work together

961
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,560
so that's basically you know what we

962
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,280
have been in the process of doing over

963
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,520
the last 10 years is just making sure

964
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,000
that all of our infrastructure

965
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,680
is well supported on v6 only networks

966
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,320
we really don't deploy anything inside

967
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,079
that you know requires d4

968
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,119
and so

969
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,680
that is our message to you is that you

970
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,040
can deploy

971
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,440
v6 only enterprise

972
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,040
data center networks

973
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,920
um you can even deploy v6 only inside of

974
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,760
your office

975
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,880
that's one other thing it's not this

976
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,480
scary thing that everybody seems to

977
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,960
think that it is

978
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,880
we have done it we did it with a small

979
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,920
team

980
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,200
and

981
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,440
i encourage you all to say

982
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,599
thank you

983
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,960
thank you paul

984

my turn

989
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,320
um

990
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,200
my journey on uh

991
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,119
talk about the retrospective first here

992
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,400
and then i'll stand up and talk a little

993
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,560
bit about what you see on the uh on the

994
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,560
slides there i currently work in the

995
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,200
meraki business unit of cisco but i've

996
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,839
been at cisco since the late 90s

997
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,640
um i was at cisco but pretty much

998
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,079
working for

999
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,520
the ietf back in 2008.

1000
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,040
um

1001
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,240
and

1002
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,560
i was area director in the ietf

1003
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,359
so

1004
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,920
spent most of my time working on ietf

1005
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,880
things

1006
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
and it kind of like this in one of these

1007
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,800
forums

1008
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,040
google was sponsoring an upcoming ietf

1009
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,920
meeting

1010
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,960
and we were all testing ipv6 at the ietf

1011
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,160
because of course the ietf had ipv6

1012
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,200
and i said

1013
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,480
well

1014
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,280
we kind of need some content on v6 i

1015
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,440
said google next ietf that you're

1016
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,960
sponsoring why don't you give at least

1017
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,240
this conference quad a's

1018
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,200
and then

1019
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,680
after that plenary session

1020
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,440
a guy walked up to me who's now with my

1021
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,839
good friend uh eric klein he gave me his

1022
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,880
card and the title on it was ipv6 guy

1023
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,079
and he said

1024
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,640
i emailed vent we'll do it

1025
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,960
i was like okay well that's that's the

1026
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
start of something okay

1027
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,160
and then

1028
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,200
he

1029
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,680
talked to his friends at facebook at

1030
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,560
yahoo et cetera et cetera we pull in

1031
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,160
john we got the eye sock there and we

1032
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,400
had a community

1033
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,280
and

1034
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,680
just as we saw this morning with ukraine

1035
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,839
a community can be powerful

1036
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,839
and how much more powerful was it

1037
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:20,000
when yahoo could go and say hey the

1038
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,480
google guys are doing it right we got to

1039
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,839
do it too

1040
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:25,119
um

1041
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,079
or

1042
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,000
you know comcast is doing it we've got

1043
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,079
to do it or at t would say you know

1044
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,760
comcast is doing att's got to do it so

1045
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,440
on and so forth right

1046
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,520
it was so much easier when you had a

1047
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,440
community behind you

1048
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,560
um so it led to a great period of time

1049
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,079
now one

1050
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,079
when we were engineering this whole

1051
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:45,839
social community

1052
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,440
technical thing

1053
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,760
you know getting the big content and the

1054
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,640
big isps on board right there's a few

1055
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,119
engineering control points that have

1056
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:57,119
massive effect because of

1057
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,680
automation and scale right

1058
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,040
and we were able to create that

1059
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,560
measuring measurement system where we

1060
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,599
see the numbers go up on the internet

1061
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,359
but enterprise

1062
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:09,839
right to your point earlier

1063
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,839
what about enterprise networks and the

1064
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,520
graph that you saw from scott hogg the

1065
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,440
famous google one that goes up like this

1066
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,520
everybody knows why there's a widening

1067
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,119
gap

1068
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,480
of of this seven day period with a

1069
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,800
little bit of like holiday you can see

1070
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,160
you can see covet in there it's

1071
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
basically when people go to the office

1072
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,800
they don't get v6 despite the great work

1073
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,040
ron berzma did at d-rin

1074
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,480
not every enterprise has a ron bursma or

1075
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,960
a janzors or somebody to

1076
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,680
make v6 go right

1077
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,280
so

1078
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,440
when meraki called me

1079
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,359
in 2019

1080
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,440
and i was i was still working on v6 i

1081
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,040
got i had the chance during the launch

1082
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,200
to kind of spearhead the movement of

1083
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,440
cisco's operation and you know in

1084
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,680
participation in v6

1085
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,440
still loved it it really wasn't my day

1086
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,960
job but they called up and i was like

1087
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,560
aha

1088
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,760
this

1089
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,079
part of the business might be able to

1090
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,800
make a difference for enterprise

1091
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,520
uh if you're not familiar meraki is all

1092
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,240
about making complex things simple

1093
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,640
complex networking technology i.t

1094
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,319
technology simple

1095
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,480
and they do it by uh

1096
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,960
allowing their equipment only to be

1097
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,040
managed from a cloud from a web

1098
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,800
interface right

1099
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,880
um you're not allowed to ssh into the

1100
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
box

1101
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,040
this also means that firmware updates

1102
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,800
can be sent out and so on and so forth

1103
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,119
so i thought aha if we can get meraki to

1104
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,000
do this maybe we can make a dent

1105
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,640
in enterprise deployments just

1106
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,520
a bit

1107
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,920
so my goal is to get that widening

1108
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,800
sawtooth to come down and

1109
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,400
we'll do as much as we can with meraki

1110
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,640
so

1111
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,480
meraki calls says we want this v6 thing

1112
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,319
and we're serious about it this time

1113
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,319
and i said okay well you're gonna have

1114
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,000
to like bring these couple of engineers

1115
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,760
of mine that i've been working with on

1116
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,160
v6 forever

1117
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,800
move us all to san francisco

1118
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,839
and

1119
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,800
we'll get your ipv6 and they said okay i

1120
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,640
was like i almost didn't expect it i was

1121
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,079
living in paris france at the time i had

1122
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,400
a great job at a research lab and cisco

1123
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,839
teaching

1124
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,040
but uh

1125
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,560
we went

1126
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,799
and

1127
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,200
the first thing they did for me is

1128
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,480
handed me a designer

1129
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,640
20 years at cisco

1130
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,000
never had worked with an artist okay we

1131
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
would argue over cli and we had our

1132
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,520
parser police and all that kind of stuff

1133
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,800
but this was a designer that really

1134
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,520
didn't know much about networking great

1135
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,960
artists

1136
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,800
put us in a room and we had to hammer

1137
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
out how to make

1138
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,560
v6 simple

1139
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,440
and

1140
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:52,720
if you don't make it simple you don't

1141
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,960
ship it

1142
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,480
we also had to make it work across the

1143
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,839
entire stack now meraki sells routers

1144
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:03,520
switches access points now cameras iot

1145
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,920
devices all sorts of stuff

1146
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,160
the access points in the switches in

1147
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,720
layer two mode could kind of allow v6 to

1148
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,119
go through them

1149
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,960
but really it's about

1150
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,560
the the the

1151
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,040
blocking pieces was the mx which is our

1152
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,119
router security appliances sits at the

1153
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,800
edge of the networks and touches all the

1154
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,280
isps

1155
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,520
as well as the dashboard product

1156
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,280
and i really wanted to be

1157
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,560
data driven and deployment-minded

1158
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,839
and i realized i should probably go to

1159
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,200
the next slide

1160
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,680
green one which is next

1161
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,240
so that's where you see in 2019 it

1162
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,079
literally says

1163
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,319
hired industry experts that's me and a

1164
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,760
couple of uh engineers from paris

1165
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,480
we wanted to show that we were

1166
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,880
really serious about this and we had to

1167
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,200
turn on quad a's uh it's one of the

1168
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,359
easier things actually to do for our

1169
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,920
cloud we own and operate our own cloud

1170
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,440
top to bottom

1171
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,839
and uh so we have good engineers and

1172
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:07,040
they were able to get the quad a's up

1173
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,240
uh

1174
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,560
then you know is like i've got the

1175
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,040
designers

1176
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,640
how do we get v6 to work across the

1177
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,720
entire stack and the the router product

1178
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,240
the mx i talked about was really the

1179
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,000
blocker

1180
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,720
and the reason was is we had to

1181
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,160
basically had to write neighbor

1182
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,680
discovery

1183
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,119
and it doesn't just use linux right so

1184
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,720
if we had to write neighbor discovery

1185
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,640
dcp v6 all of it from scratch

1186
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,319
which allowed us to also embed it

1187
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,640
and make it work more seamlessly

1188
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,480
looking at these things so you see the

1189
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,119
mr and the ms and the mx so

1190
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,359
a little bit of data here

1191
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,200
um

1192
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,599
i wanted to be

1193
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,119
deployment-minded and data-centric so

1194
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,319
the first thing we did was started

1195
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:02,400
releasing firmware that would actually

1196
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,760
see and process an ra from the uplink

1197
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,359
and usually we're plugged into either

1198
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,960
residential or business isp

1199
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,760
service providers

1200
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,839
if we see the ra we assume

1201
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,160
we have v6 right

1202
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,400
so we start collecting that data because

1203
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,000
all of our products are connected to the

1204
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,880
cloud

1205
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,800
there's no exception

1206
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:25,760
and

1207
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,119
that's what you see this for this very

1208
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,560
long time

1209
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,280
this is the number of meraki mx

1210
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,119
connected to an internet service

1211
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,400
provider that has v6 on the uplink and

1212
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,319
we had very small very small very small

1213
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,440
very small

1214
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,520
and then as you've seen

1215
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,839
once you turn it on you realize

1216
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:44,800
there's

1217
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,280
quite a lot of

1218
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,800
isps out there with ipv6 so this number

1219
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,200
passed just in the past month or so went

1220
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,400
over a million mx with ipv6 configured

1221
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,960
on their uplink

1222
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,200
we've got that's more than 50 percent

1223
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,880
already

1224
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,640
of mx's that are active and in use today

1225
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,480
so that's because of all the hard work

1226
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,920
that

1227
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:12,720
the isps have done all of you have done

1228
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,240
to just

1229
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,000
make v6 available by default on so many

1230
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,119
uh uplinks

1231
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,359
so how do we make now that we've got v6

1232
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:27,280
on the uplink how do we get it down to

1233
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,599
to the endpoints well the only way to do

1234
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:31,680
it is on by default

1235
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,079
so that's the strategy we took

1236
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,760
so if you go in well first of all the

1237
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
weighing up link this is kind of what

1238
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,599
you see there was part of the part of

1239
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,400
what the designer told us was uh we

1240
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,880
don't want to have like ipv6 and ipv4

1241
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,760
modes we want it to be kind of built in

1242
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,440
and those little little black dots

1243
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,200
things on there where we obfuscate the

1244
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,680
global ipv6 address it's necessary when

1245
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,000
we do public presentations

1246
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,560
but this is an actual screenshot of what

1247
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,200
you get in you know released firmware

1248
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,680
today um if you have an mx

1249
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,240
if there is ipv6 on that uplink we show

1250
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,480
you there's ipv6 on that uplink and

1251
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,480
there's no way to turn it off you can

1252
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,960
turn the whole link off but you cannot

1253
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,200
just turn off v6

1254
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,440
it's always there

1255
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,160
and we figure it's better

1256
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,160
even if you don't want v6 on your lan

1257
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:23,680
it's better for you to know it's on your

1258
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,880
wan

1259
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
then for us to drop it silently or

1260
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,440
something like that so we don't allow

1261
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,160
you

1262
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,319
we don't not tell you it's there we tell

1263
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,079
you it's there always and you can't turn

1264
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,319
that off

1265
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,440
um

1266
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,040
now

1267
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,880
that's like when you first plug in the

1268
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,640
box then you have to

1269
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,800
configure the the lan side this isn't

1270
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,520
residential it's enterprise it's maybe

1271
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,560
sort of

1272
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,599
um

1273
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,680
not your well we have very big customers

1274
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:52,880
i want to say that anyway it's not

1275
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,200
consumer but it's it's it's still you

1276
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,960
have to configure something and you have

1277
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,599
to create a lan

1278
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,839
and when you create a new vlan because

1279
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:04,079
you can have course mini virtual lands

1280
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,760
you basically have this it's kind of

1281
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,319
hard to read sorry on the upper left

1282
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:09,760
side of the screen

1283
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,720
you have this you know that's i've i'm

1284
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,920
creating a vlan i name it i

1285
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,480
um i have to give it a number then i hit

1286
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,640
next and then i have my v4 and you have

1287
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,240
to configure the v4 but the v6 is

1288
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,920
enabled by default

1289
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,400
and we can have it on by default because

1290
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,800
we can get prefixes from the isp via

1291
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,319
dhcp v6pd we can put them in a pool

1292
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,079
mapped to the wan that we've received

1293
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,119
them on

1294
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,280
and give them to the land we don't you

1295
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,640
don't have to configure anything if you

1296
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,000
don't want to

1297
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,680
and then you're done you have v6 by

1298
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,920
default so we're expecting

1299
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,160
now that we have the um

1300
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,400
the the firmware that has both wind and

1301
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,599
lan side that we're going to get more

1302
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,480
and more and more adoption over time on

1303
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,400
the land side

1304
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:58,240
for existing vlans we wanted to make as

1305
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,000
simple as possible as well it's actually

1306
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,800
three steps one you have to say modify

1307
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,480
two you have to say enable and then

1308
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,720
you're back to that same view where it's

1309
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,240
all enabled by default

1310
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,200
the

1311
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,839
prefix delegation page

1312
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,599
we have a new tab there where it's

1313
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:19,520
basically telling you we're in this new

1314
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,280
world where we're getting delegated

1315
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,200
prefixes from isps and if i have any

1316
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,400
requests

1317
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,960
to the isp community is to please give

1318
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,359
those delegated prefixes we're building

1319
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,400
this

1320
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,040
not as a nat box but as a router we're

1321
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:36,240
trying everything we can do here to make

1322
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,240
it as easy as possible

1323
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,119
and

1324
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,480
also to not nat what that means is we

1325
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,880
got to have delegated prefixes a slash

1326
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,960
64 just isn't good enough and lord knows

1327
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,599
that 20 128 is terrible

1328
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,440
so

1329
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,359
when you enable on the land side we

1330
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,119
start asking on those land sides give me

1331
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,040
a slash 56

1332
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,079
if you don't give me anything give me a

1333
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,559
slash six give me a slash 64. this is

1334
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,559
probably one of the the most complicated

1335
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,559
things that we do to make it simple for

1336
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:05,839
the end user

1337
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:07,440
right but we do that to grab as many

1338
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,440
prefixes as we can

1339
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,280
and then we start assigning them to the

1340
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,400
lands

1341
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,800
and we will even split them up if we run

1342
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:15,680
out

1343
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,880
and we try to use them efficiently

1344
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,200
but there's a point where maybe if

1345
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,200
you've got you know a thousand vlans

1346
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,119
you're going to run out and then what do

1347
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:27,200
we do

1348
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,839
that's where it stops being simple

1349
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,599
that's where you have to like start a

1350
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,200
human has to go okay do you want to put

1351
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,440
ulas on or not you can you can manually

1352
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,720
do this

1353
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,599
then when we route the packets

1354
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,079
we remember the if they were delegated

1355
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,760
prefixes from a wan and we will send

1356
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,400
them out the correct land but when

1357
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,559
but if for some reason that wins down

1358
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,319
we'll nad it to another land because of

1359
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:52,160
bcp38

1360
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,280
but all of that complexity there

1361
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,400
is there to keep it simple for the end

1362
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,240
user

1363
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,200
one minute okay

1364
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,720
so you see some of those land size

1365
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,800
prefixes if you know we were zoomed in

1366
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,680
there you would see this cute little um

1367
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,119
four and six with a hexagon for six and

1368
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,200
a square for four that's some of this uh

1369
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,920
artistic stuff that gets built in

1370
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,920
and the aqua page is even better where

1371
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,480
we build the v4 and the v6 together so

1372
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,640
you can create a rule

1373
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,880
one apple if you wanted to apply for v4

1374
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,720
and v6 you don't have to keep them

1375
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:29,920
separate

1376
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,200
um so again all the all this work to

1377
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,240
make a

1378
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,359
to make

1379
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,440
v6 enabled by default

1380
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,760
and to make it easier

1381
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,720
to uh to manage

1382
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:43,760
so

1383
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,640
we keep posting updates out there

1384
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,559
and i i hope this

1385
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:49,760
and i want to come back and give another

1386
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,280
presentation at some point where i show

1387
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,240
the data on the lan side of the adoption

1388
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
that we're getting into end i expect it

1389
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,119
to be

1390
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,040
like we've seen from our residential

1391
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,200
providers that when we turn it on it's

1392
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,280
there right on the on the endpoints and

1393
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,760
we've started turning it on but it takes

1394
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,200
time for the uh for the the new vlans

1395
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,400
to uh

1396
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,319
to come online because we have more

1397
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:14,800
existing vlans than new vlans right

1398
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:15,599
so

1399
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:20,079
what we want is to track all this and

1400
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,559
see how it's being used and at some

1401
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,720
point in the future

1402
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,160
to be able to

1403
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,040
enable it on all the vlans

1404
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,720
with a notice it'll be like an upgrade

1405
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,480
oh and by the way you're going to get v6

1406
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:33,680
right

1407
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,559
and then watch the v6 and start

1408
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,160
bringing out technologies that allow us

1409
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,440
to take v4 off the lands and just walk

1410
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,520
the customer through that journey

1411
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,680
with easy by default types of steps

1412
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,720
and hopefully that can be a um

1413
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,280
a pattern for for other

1414
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,880
vendors and other

1415
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,520
enterprises to follow

1416
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,599
so thank you mark so

1417
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:01,280
when you spoke about

1418
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:03,119
uh power of the community coming

1419
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,000
together and since we had

1420
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,400
ipv6 day and ipv6 launch

1421
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,839
do we need some

1422
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:12,319
something like this some more events one

1423
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,520
new event with peer pressure to maybe

1424
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,400
put ipv6 on by default and

1425
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,800
and use the same mechanism as we did 10

1426
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,680
years ago to move the needle forward

1427
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,040
maybe

1428
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,559
uh john

1429
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:27,599
will you

1430
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,440
i'd love to thank you for this

1431
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,640
discussion i don't think i've stayed

1432
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,880
this quiet this long in a long time so

1433
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,000
so uh

1434
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,800

friends long time friends i mean in some

1436
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,920
ways

1437
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,240
a lot of what we're hearing here i i was

1438
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,319
old as new right gradual enabling you

1439
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:46,640
know turn it on gradually upload i

1440
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,240
learned it all from you

1441
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,240
i love you man i love you

1442
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:51,280
the uh

1443
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,599
but uh you know the and and i'm a little

1444
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:55,680
emotional right now not really but kind

1445
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,760
of figuratively you know you know i

1446
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,520
think about the conversation

1447
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,880
i had with vince i had i had the

1448
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,240
pleasure to see him in person a few

1449
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,319
weeks ago to prep to prepare for this

1450
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,240
for the video we did this morning

1451
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,599
and we were kind of talking about this

1452
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,839
you know you know 10 years later lots of

1453
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,119
progress

1454
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:13,680
but we still have a long way to go right

1455
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,680
i i had the honor to come back here in

1456
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,440
the fall and i kind of did some you know

1457
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,720
look at some data

1458
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,400
by some measures i mean it could be

1459
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,800
another 10 years but then i hear

1460
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,520
on by default on by default eric nygren

1461
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,520
on by default paul's been on by default

1462
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,520
for you know you know years matthew 2

1463
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:32,960
and etc right so now i'm confused right

1464
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,760
so

1465
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,200
and one of the things that i i do want

1466
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,680
to kind of comment on is v6 on by

1467
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,000
default just to be crystal clear is not

1468
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,640
necessarily v6 only someday

1469
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,599
hopefully v6 only i won't be here right

1470
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,200
yeah these guys will be all like on

1471
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,440
vacation somewhere on a beast together

1472
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,319
but but whoever comes to this next the

1473
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:54,319
next generation or two i mean yeah i see

1474
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,040
that in in the future but

1475
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,680
the question is burning right so

1476
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,599
what's the problem i mean like i i

1477
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,880
didn't know many of these things even

1478
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,240
though we've kind of tried to you know

1479
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,480
maniacally plan for our panel here we

1480
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,599
left a lot we left some room for

1481
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,440
variability here right but there's a lot

1482
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,280
of there's a lot of news here about b6

1483
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,040
on by default i mean

1484
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,400
i don't think we're done

1485
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,800
so i i i'm going to pose the question to

1486
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,920
you all

1487
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,000
so what what holds us back what what

1488
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,000
hinders us you know

1489
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,680
are you all disappointed in where things

1490
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:26,160
stand as far as v6 is concerned you know

1491
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,599
let's let's open that up a little bit

1492
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,319
and

1493
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,400
kind of spice the conversation up you

1494
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,319
know so that we can

1495
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,680
you know get some feedback from the

1496
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,160
audience yeah have your voices heard

1497
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,440
thoughts

1498
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,839
jason

1499
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,680
i

1500
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,079
echo the sentiment for sure of on by

1501
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:49,839
default i think the main message is that

1502
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:51,280
when you're turning the service up for a

1503
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,400
customer

1504
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,240
it's okay for them to break on that one

1505
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,599
little thing because they're not yet

1506
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,200
production you're not taking them down

1507
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,000
and it helps them highlight any areas

1508
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,319
that need to be fixed and if necessary

1509
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,880
opt out if they have to but hopefully no

1510
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,400
go fix it

1511
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,799
it's a lot harder to go in and

1512
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,799
once it's up and running to go and

1513
00:55:12,799 --> 00:55:14,640
change the knob because then you're

1514
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,480
putting them at risk of

1515
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,960
breaking them

1516
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,400
this is

1517
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,559
i imagine true for service providers

1518
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,160
it's certainly true for

1519
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,160
uh internal stuff and places i've worked

1520
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,599
at nobody wants to touch the thing

1521
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,119
that's working

1522
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,799
uh

1523
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,559
it takes a lot more effort to do it

1524
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:35,359
after the fact

1525
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:38,079
one zoom uh i'm assuming that

1526
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:40,480
the zoom folks can hear us right

1527
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:42,079
a b team

1528
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,720
paul eric ron

1529
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:47,720
thoughts

1530
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:52,799
one of you

1531
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,280
they're the three developers

1532
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,960
the long tail ends up being a real

1533
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,440
challenge here like for isps a lot of

1534
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,200
the big isps who have turned things on

1535
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,359
by default have had huge growth but

1536
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,280
there are a lot of smaller isps out

1537
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,920
there that haven't had that big

1538
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,240
push or drive or need to enable ipv6

1539
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,240
that haven't um and this i think the

1540
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,079
same goes across

1541
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,280
enterprises

1542
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,920
and it also but that also goes across

1543
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,160
even on the device side we see that the

1544
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,440
it's not it the major browsers and major

1545
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,440
operating systems all have ipv6 on by

1546
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,359
default but when you start getting out

1547
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,680
into consumer electronics

1548
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,680
or many mobile apps

1549
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,920
there are plenty that either don't have

1550
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,559
ipv6 on by default or have bad ipv6

1551
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,880
implementations like we've seen cases

1552
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,799
where

1553
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,319
where a you get the combination of a isp

1554
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,280
that has done a poor imp a poor ipv6411

1555
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,760
has some connectivity issues um combined

1556
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,280
with a

1557
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:55,680
some smart tv that doesn't do happy

1558
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,160
eyeballs and now you have a streaming

1559
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,400
provider that turns on tries to turn v6

1560
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:03,200
on and um starts getting complaints

1561
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,720
because in some country where that smart

1562
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,799
tv is popular users can't go watch their

1563
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,880
stream anymore and that content then

1564
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,960
gets switched back to v4 only and this

1565
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,680
is not in the kind of the core set of of

1566
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,119
of

1567
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,280
names that everyone would have heard of

1568
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,960
but it can but even those things out at

1569
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,760
the tail can be enough um to be causing

1570
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,880
real problems that i think are going to

1571
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,720
be one of the challenges we have to face

1572
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,520
over the next um decade

1573
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,119
you know eric if i can chime in briefly

1574
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,960
before others do i i used to think the

1575
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,280
same way you know the smaller isps you

1576
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,359
know where they at so my family and i

1577
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,799
went on on a short easter trip this year

1578
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,000
you know as i always do i visit

1579
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,359
testv6.com you know like why not i mean

1580
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:46,480
that's what of course first thing you do

1581
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,319
when you connect to the to the airbnb

1582
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,000
yeah wi-fi

1583
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,040
v6 on enabled by default eric can you

1584
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,880
believe it i i couldn't believe it i was

1585
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,680
a pentel data anybody for pentel anyone

1586
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,720
bueller

1587
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,000
no you should be yeah good job right um

1588
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,960
so so anyway you know uh back to you

1589
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,720
know others here you know chime in

1590
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:08,480
please i mean you know

1591
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,599
we're i'm still confused right yeah

1592
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,359
matthew please yeah i mean i think i

1593
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:14,559
think to a certain degree like the

1594
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,680
success of world ipv6 day and launch

1595
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,359
were certainly the community that came

1596
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:21,520
out of that the the concerted focus

1597
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,079
around making ipv6 available

1598
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:25,920
getting past those gaps that did exist

1599
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,480
or at least we thought may have existed

1600
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,280
and

1601
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,160
to me i think where where maybe we need

1602
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,920
to see some more traction is outside

1603
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,920
this community i think the folks mainly

1604
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,000
in this room have understanding they've

1605
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,920
done their part in many cases

1606
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,839
i think it's the long tail it's the long

1607
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:43,520
tail that predo curve

1608
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,200
you know i think it was uh it was scotty

1609
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,640
who had that slide up the top million

1610
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,920
websites something like 20 or v6 enabled

1611
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,280
so i think it's kind of that long tail

1612
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,319
and maybe

1613
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:54,480
maybe cdn plays a role maybe there are

1614
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:56,400
other pieces where there's choke points

1615
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,559
that can can have an amplified effect

1616
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:00,160
but i think to some degree it's still

1617
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,000
outside this room it's consumer

1618
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,200
electronics

1619
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,359
apps that kind of thing so matthew

1620
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:07,040
question for you so

1621
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,040
service provider right you know i i've

1622
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,440
been there right um

1623
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,000
cgn you talk about cgn you talk about v4

1624
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,880
service map e map t i mean still

1625
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,359
provides v for connectivity it's

1626
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:20,880
different and i do want to get back if

1627
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,400
the gentleman's here from netflix who

1628
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,040
asked the question in the previous panel

1629
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,720
i i would like for you to come back up

1630
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,960
when we do some open q a but my question

1631
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:29,920
to you is

1632
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,440
what do you think do you think that

1633
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,040
would be a motivator do you think that

1634
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,640
would change the game

1635
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,480
i i i do have a follow-on comment on

1636
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,280
that yeah no i think cgn for sure is is

1637
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,359
going to be the future more and more

1638
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,640
um

1639
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,400
and i think one way one way i look at it

1640
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,720
now is more and more customers served by

1641
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,880
cgn but i want to see less and less

1642
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,200
traffic served by cgn so that means

1643
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,720
identifying what is the traffic that's

1644
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,480
relying upon it that could be going v6

1645
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,559
that's not and why is that let's tackle

1646
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:57,520
that

1647
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,119
great

1648
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,760
one comment and then uh you know open it

1649
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,680
up again so to the netflix gentleman who

1650
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,119
was at the mic last time

1651
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:06,400
what i you know there was a comment

1652
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,240
around you know v6 was broken the first

1653
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,000
step was to turn off v6 what i have

1654
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
found personally when you use it to run

1655
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,520
your business

1656
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,480
like

1657
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,040
operate a cable model for example like

1658
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,280
you you make sure v6 works period you

1659
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,720
don't have a choice otherwise the rest

1660
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,640
of your services don't work when there

1661
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,319
are ships in the night that that

1662
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,440
ultimately creates the greatest

1663
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,040
opportunity for things to get out of

1664
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,440
sync and broken back to you all you know

1665
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,599
either in person or

1666
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,040
i have one thing to add on these

1667
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,480
challenges you asked earlier you know

1668
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,079
what are the challenges to get v6 on by

1669
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,680
default one of the things i would love

1670
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,599
to know from you like how mark in his

1671
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,200
presentation said uh v6 on by default

1672
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,200
and new vlans existing vlans you can

1673
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,799
enable it uh we have the existing enable

1674
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:51,440
option we don't have it new by default

1675
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:54,640
uh what we are i guess what i would love

1676
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:56,880
folks as inputs on is how do you define

1677
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:59,680
new in in a world in in the cloud where

1678
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,079
you can literally spin up new in seconds

1679
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:04,960
it's all scripted and your load balancer

1680
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,559
a new load balancer is basically the

1681
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,119
same one replica running a entire

1682
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:11,599
production traffic and that new is no

1683
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:14,079
longer new because it looks to us as new

1684
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,160
but it's really an existing application

1685
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,720
that has live traffic on it

1686
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,720
so not necessarily to you but that's

1687
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,160
that's one of the challenges that we

1688
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,000
sort of think about so how do you define

1689
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,280
in that world what that new identity is

1690
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,480
where you say in this new box it's safe

1691
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,520
versus like the old box not so not so

1692
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,960
much

1693
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,720
interesting mark

1694
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,720
well from

1695
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,040
from meraki's standpoint and and you

1696
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,040
know maybe this can translate into you

1697
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,160
know the aws vpc creation or some such

1698
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,119
is

1699
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:48,960
that

1700
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,799
essentially anywhere

1701
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,880
um we can avoid

1702
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,039
the the user having to type in an ip

1703
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:57,520
address we try to avoid it right and we

1704
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,920
do that with with more and more with v4

1705
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,720
as well as um with v6 and it turns out

1706
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:03,920
that

1707
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,240
it's actually easier in v6 in a way

1708
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,559
right because if you have those

1709
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:10,640
delegated prefixes

1710
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:12,559
you can use them and do it

1711
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:15,359
algorithmically right um

1712
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:16,160
so

1713
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,640
so that's what you saw where

1714
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:19,520
when

1715
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:21,119
we're enabling

1716
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,400
the topology create the vlan

1717
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,880
we give them v4 and v6 and the v6 is

1718
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,359
actually easier than v4 in the default

1719
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:31,119
mode right

1720
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,319
um

1721
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:34,559
so you know perhaps in the vpc one of

1722
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:35,920
the one of the things you said is you

1723
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:38,000
know it's like oh it lets you wrap up a

1724
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,680
customer's cloud environment and give

1725
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,839
them private addresses right well maybe

1726
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,680
with v6 you can give them public

1727
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,039
addresses um or give them private ulas

1728
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,440
and and not them out of floating uh v6

1729
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,200
if you must but this is one thing that

1730
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,359
we're trying to avoid and

1731
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,359
it all depends on how many delegated

1732
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:57,520
prefixes we can get i suppose with with

1733
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,200
aws you could allocate as many as you

1734
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,960
wanted from from

1735
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,599
your your pa space and

1736
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:06,799
um from your pi space given to them

1737
01:03:06,799 --> 01:03:09,280
and and maybe they could bring their own

1738
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,680
uh addresses but then we hit the bgp

1739
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,720
issues

1740
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,799
but anyway that's going down in rat hall

1741
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,720
um i think there's things that you can

1742
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,599
do and we should talk about this

1743
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:20,960
afterwards

1744
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,480
um just to go through that workflow and

1745
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,559
try to eliminate as many steps as

1746
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:29,359
possible yeah yeah

1747
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:30,960
awesome

1748
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,359
mr saab i remember

1749
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,680
in your office the old one we sat

1750
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,520
together side by side turning on

1751
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:38,880
facebook for

1752
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,039
you know for uh you know some some uh

1753
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,119
comment subscribers

1754
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,520
just like yesterday right um so what are

1755
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:48,240
your thoughts paul um you know as far as

1756
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,599
i mean and this is

1757
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:50,960
you know to some extent i have to

1758
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,720
imagine you know as close as we've been

1759
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,640
over the years you know this

1760
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,720
is probably like an old conversation for

1761
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,440
you right so any words of wisdom

1762
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,760
thoughts

1763
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,640
you know

1764
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:08,799
the work that we did was like

1765
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:10,880
i i have to think it was like maybe two

1766
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,119
or three of us were actually leading the

1767
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,960
project and we had

1768
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,039
um an excellent project manager that

1769
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,119
basically sat down with everybody

1770
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,640
inside of you know infrastructure and

1771
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,640
just like kind of forced them

1772
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:24,160
there's a funny story if there was a

1773
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,920
team that wasn't listening or wasn't

1774
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,200
actually doing the work he would go and

1775
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,799
sit down next to the engineers and shame

1776
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:29,680
them

1777
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,160
uh but he would just sit there and

1778
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,599
you know just do his work and just

1779
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,119
remind them that he was you know on

1780
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,960
their case every day

1781
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,839
um

1782
01:04:37,839 --> 01:04:41,039
but for us you know we

1783
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,680
v6 is a mission-critical part of our

1784
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,119
business we could not be scaling our

1785
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:47,359
data centers we could not be scaling

1786
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,920
anything that we do

1787
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,400
at facebook meta

1788
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,400
inside of our data centers you know we

1789
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,839
we had to

1790
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:57,760
migrate internally

1791
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:01,039
to v6 um because the other option was we

1792
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,039
had to renumber before

1793
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,240
all of our rfc 1918 space or go out and

1794
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,440
buy some

1795
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,440
you know public space and use that

1796
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:10,960
internally which we would have murdered

1797
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,000
for

1798
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,359
um

1799
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:15,119
you know and and the project

1800
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,000
while it was a tough 18 months and i i

1801
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
say tough because there was times where

1802
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,440
i did not think

1803
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,599
we were going to be successful

1804
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:25,440
and

1805
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:27,680
you know we just slogged through and

1806
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,280
jason is right

1807
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,119
you know it's not easy to take a big

1808
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:33,440
moving ship and uh

1809
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,280
convert it in flight

1810
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,559
um but you're also wrong jason in that

1811
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:41,599
if you just put a small dedicated team

1812
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,440
they can they can pull off anything you

1813
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,200
know i mean i think you know google

1814
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,880
lorenzo and eric did most of the work

1815
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,160
themselves

1816
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,359
and so

1817
01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:51,680
this is like the key to all of the other

1818
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,599
you know operators and app developers

1819
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:56,400
out there it's it's not that part

1820
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:57,280
um

1821
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,720
the thing that you will probably run

1822
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,480
into is what reddit ran into a couple

1823
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,000
weeks ago when they were trying to test

1824
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,920
it on their android app happy eyeballs

1825
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,319
is still not really well supported on

1826
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:07,440
android

1827
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:08,400
um

1828
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,200
and i think just okay http just got like

1829
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,520
happy eyeball support recently

1830
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,599
you know we had to go and develop all

1831
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:17,359
that stuff ourselves in our apps and

1832
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,119
make sure that we were

1833
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:20,880
um

1834
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,200
uh you know supporting not only dual

1835
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,599
stack networks but v6 only networks you

1836
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,240
know before apple fixed a lot of their

1837
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,640
stuff for v6 only um in the operating

1838
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,880
system we had to you know do the work

1839
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,359
ourselves to to make it work

1840
01:06:35,359 --> 01:06:35,710
um

1841
01:06:35,710 --> 01:06:37,119
[Music]

1842
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,720
there's there's just

1843
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:39,700
you know there's um

1844
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:41,920
[Music]

1845
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,920
i think that

1846
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,000
we're at an interesting point in that

1847
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,839
you know there's there's a lot of work

1848
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,440
that's been going on and then the long

1849
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,680
tail just isn't isn't happening

1850
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:53,920
um you know i'll call them out by name

1851
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,599
because there wouldn't you know roku is

1852
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,000
probably one of the biggest um

1853
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,640
culprits to see more and more

1854
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,000
growth on the internet you know they're

1855
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,280
one of the largest streaming set top

1856
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,039
boxes and they still haven't turned on

1857
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,079
v6

1858
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,520
you know even though you knew john have

1859
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,520
been yelling at them many of us have

1860
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,440
been yelling at them for years it's

1861
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:12,880
still not there

1862
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,319
um and so you know how do you get all of

1863
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,000
these you know consumer devices that are

1864
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,319
sitting in people's homes to to turn on

1865
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,920
v6 because

1866
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,520
you know a good portion of the

1867
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,319
residential users you know have it

1868
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:28,319
and you know we're just lacking you know

1869
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,720
step top boxes you know consumer

1870
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,039
electronic devices and offices

1871
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:34,480
so

1872
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,280
i you know it's it's it's really just

1873
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:38,960
rolling up your sleeves and doing the

1874
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,559
work

1875
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:44,319
great paul ron last but not least

1876
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:46,880
words of wisdom thoughts

1877
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,359
uh yeah um so i've been thinking through

1878
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:51,520
the uh on by default which we've been

1879
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,520
doing for a long time and and the thing

1880
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,440
that comes to my mind is that you can

1881
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,960
lead a horse to water but you can't make

1882
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,000
them drink

1883
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,559
and we've seen that a lot where i can

1884
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:03,680
mandate that all of our subscribers on

1885
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,319
drain i can give them ipv6 addresses

1886
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:09,039
give every site of 48 i can

1887
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:11,359
mandate that their border router um is

1888
01:08:11,359 --> 01:08:13,280
up on v6 but

1889
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,119
um i don't control those large

1890
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:16,960
laboratories and defense contractors and

1891
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,399
so forth they run on their own networks

1892
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:19,600
and they don't enable it on their

1893
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,839
firewall or in their internal networks i

1894
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:23,120
don't control that so what's the

1895
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,439
incentive but the only controls i have

1896
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,880
is other things they might want to get

1897
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:27,759
to

1898
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:30,238
inside our environment is start turning

1899
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:33,359
off v4 so they're forced to turn on v6

1900
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,880
that's a bit of incentive it works to a

1901
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,000
certain

1902
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,960
degree

1903
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:39,520
but i i've been frustrated with

1904
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:41,198
mandates that don't work and i've been

1905
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:43,279
through a lot of them over the years

1906
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,158
i am a fan of flag days and that might

1907
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:48,719
be heresy just because of what it means

1908
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:51,120
but i was there in 1983 when we turned

1909
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,319
off ncp it was a huge motivator

1910
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,000
i remember when we turned off the six

1911
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,920
bone i remember

1912
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,920
when we converted from analog to digital

1913
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:01,679
tv it was a flag day and it was

1914
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,759
successful the um

1915
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,080
there was also the the dns flag day just

1916
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:08,158
a few years ago that was successful when

1917
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:10,880
can we have some kind of a um a v6 flag

1918
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,640
day where we turn off before or start

1919
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,960
turning it off for real

1920
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:17,600
um set the deadline that'll be a huge

1921
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,520
motivator um maybe that's impossible but

1922
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,359
that's what's going to get it done

1923
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,439
um in the long run so

1924
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:27,198
it's something to think about just as

1925
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:28,719
the next step beyond turn it on by

1926
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:30,399
default let's start turning off before

1927
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,359
we can so that's my final thought

1928
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:36,799
i got one thing to jump in here um hey

1929
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,880
on on the on by default because i i

1930
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,880
didn't really answer that for you

1931
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,158
when

1932
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:43,120
one

1933
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:45,600
piece of the network decides to make it

1934
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,479
on by default they're doing a huge favor

1935
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:50,399
for that other piece

1936
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:52,158
so right now in my job at meraki i'm

1937
01:09:52,158 --> 01:09:54,880
sitting between the isps which

1938
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:55,679
by

1939
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:58,000
data that i can show my you know

1940
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,440
superiors

1941
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,840
you know look the isps already have this

1942
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,280
v6 on by default right i see and on the

1943
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,600
on the lan side i know

1944
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,280
that the apples and the androids and the

1945
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,719
windows and

1946
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:12,880
other things have it on by default so i

1947
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:14,320
know i'm sitting there in the middle and

1948
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:17,280
we can just turn up the dial right

1949
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,920
what if i had had to go and say okay now

1950
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,239
we gotta call comcast and uh ask them to

1951
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:24,000
turn it on for all the meraki customers

1952
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,560
here's the list yeah it's it's

1953
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,679
it wouldn't have happened so being

1954
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,280
preemptive you know making sure the

1955
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,640
chicken appeared before the egg actually

1956
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:32,159
was extremely valuable in this case so

1957
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:34,640
this on by default is hugely important

1958
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,199
how do we put a day around it that's

1959
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:39,360
that's maybe a harder question but the

1960
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,440
messaging of owned by default

1961
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,120
hugely important

1962
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,320
it makes it so much easier for everybody

1963
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,560
else who's trying to make it go

1964
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:49,520
all right so we're going to get the hook

1965
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,440
here mark so i'm going to wrap it up if

1966
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,760
uh if you don't mind so

1967
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,920
lady and gentlemen

1968
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,520
thank you so much despite our best

1969
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,880
efforts jan we cut it close we're we're

1970
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:02,960
this close to being able to take some q

1971
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,400
a so we so but we can't do that so at

1972
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,760
the end of the day if you anybody has

1973
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,520
questions we know there's some online

1974
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:10,480
i'll work with the panelists to make

1975
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:11,760
sure that we can address them and answer

1976
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,440
them virtually right

1977
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,000
so if anybody here has the same please

1978
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,520
channel questions and we will absolutely

1979
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,040
