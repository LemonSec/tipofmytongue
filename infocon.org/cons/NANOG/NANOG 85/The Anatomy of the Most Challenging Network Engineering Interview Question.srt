19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,520

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,760
interesting

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,159
uh kind of brain teaser

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,320
have you noticed who watches all the

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,640
non-accessions every single minute of

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:13,600
those

26
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,159
other than our director valley there is

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,720
somebody else a group of people

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,520

my first name is kim kam director of

71
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,560
cloud engineering with oracle and i am

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,040
here to talk about

73
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,360
um

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,519
dynamic the trickiest network

75
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,560
engineering interview question

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,840
this is kind of part two to another

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,760
uh nana

78
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,519
presentation that we had

79
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,800
but

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
if you have not watched the other one

81
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,640
it's on youtube you can always get a

82
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,760
hold of it

83
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,239
it was an interesting talk

84
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,720
so let's just have a quick look back

85
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,319
around two years ago two and a half

86
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,120
years ago we talked about

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,680
network engineering and

88
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,480
you know interview questions before

89
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,959
covet no masks no work from home nothing

90
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,879
like that i mean we got together in

91
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,040
austin and that was the session that i

92
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
presented back then it was a brand new

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
session and

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,400
kind of new topic

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
uh half controversial

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
you know one of those topics

97
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,360
but

98
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
uh interesting thing was i got enormous

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,120
feedback many people reached out still

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
believe it or not two years on people

101
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,720
contact me the three stories some of the

102
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,640
stories you know funny stories some

103
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,879
really sad watching stories or this

104
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,200
happens to me that happens to me but the

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,200
interesting part something that really

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,879
really caught my attention and was sort

107
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
of my motivation to put together the

108
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,120
second session was

109
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
the stories and feedback that i got from

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,918
the interviewers people who reached out

111
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,680
just let me know you know what

112
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
we want this and we made these changes

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,639
actually a few people had me review

114
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,080
their changes and that was really

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,320
interesting you kind of feel like you

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,360
are really making an impact here so

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
uh it felt really good

118
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
that is why i decided to put together

119
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,720
another session but this time

120
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,840
not so independently so i put together a

121
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,560
survey worked with 26 people

122
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,919
these are all veteran interviewers um

123
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,520
all of them they've done over a thousand

124
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
technical interviews for large companies

125
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,880
and the result of survey is something

126
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,560
that we

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,639
are presenting here today

128
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,680
what

129
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,639
other

130
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,479
things i heard from people some folks

131
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,320
might also talk about you know the top

132
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,039
question top 10 questions or you know

133
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,880
let's just turn this into a nano

134
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,600
tutorial for hour and a half and just

135
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,199
talk about you know the interview

136
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,800
questions and process

137
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,160
not really practical so what

138
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,759
we decided to do

139
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
not at 85 in montreal was

140
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
we had a few options

141
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,919
i thought about the

142
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,639
blocking the broken process

143
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,479
talked about the cognitive bias you know

144
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,440
what they are for example if someone is

145
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,759
young cannot be experienced someone is

146
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,240
old cannot be a quick learner

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,479
and also another one the third one is an

148
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,240
interesting one expectation versus

149
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,960
reality many messages that people send

150
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,360
to me about your interview experience

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
have that element in that what it means

152
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,360
is

153
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,720
most people

154
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,160
uh this is this is actually kind of

155
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,360
interesting

156
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,479
i have 10 years 15 years 20 years 25

157
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,639
years experience and i went to this job

158
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,479
interview and did not know 60 of the

159
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
questions

160
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,280
well

161
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,520
the other thing i think the other kind

162
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,120
of um

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
well

164
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,160
sad experience was

165
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,080
i knew the answers and he answered them

166
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
all but i felt apparently what they

167
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,639
highlighted was not exactly the answer

168
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,479
that they offered them

169
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,639
so this time around i decided to

170
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,280
just grab the most commonly asked

171
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,560
question

172
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,240
based on the survey

173
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
and i went through hundreds of interview

174
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,039
questions technical network engineering

175
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,840
questions let's find out what that what

176
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,319
that question is and then

177
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,160
i'm going to have only 20 25 minutes

178
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,479
probably here let's analyze that

179
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,639
question and see why does that

180
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,880
particular question could be the most

181
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,919
challenging question or trickiest

182
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,240
so that was the kind of decision final

183
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,599
decision the reason i put this

184
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,199
presentation together then we're going

185
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:01,120
to have 30 minutes that's going to spark

186
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
some thoughts and we're going to put our

187
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,919
heads together and hopefully next time

188
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,639
who knows next conference or conference

189
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
after we'll get together and

190
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,240
and

191
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,319
see what we did

192
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,280
so

193
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,240
the tricky question what really makes an

194
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,080
interview question tricky

195
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,479
so first of all i mean it technically

196
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,599
has to be

197
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,039
a deep question so your expectation is

198
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,400
the candidate

199
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,759
is not here

200
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,000
just to you know spell a bunch of things

201
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,840
that they memorized

202
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,599
the previous presentation we covered

203
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,120
that we talked about a whole bunch of

204
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,039
bullet points we talked about the things

205
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,440
that people do ask like all the bgp

206
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,919
attributes and people memorize inbound

207
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,599
and outbound policies

208
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,479
and

209
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,879
we don't want to do that we cover that

210
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,560
one we also want to see some problem

211
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,400
solving skills we want to see the

212
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,000
thought process we want the candidate to

213
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,960
think loud we also want to be

214
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,720
engaged in a conversation with the

215
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,919
candidates

216
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,160
another thing is we want to see if the

217
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,759
candidate is able to structure the

218
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,960
answers it really matters to

219
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
many interviewers according to the

220
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,759
survey

221
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
and

222
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,599
this is an interesting one

223
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,240
the questions that are multi-dimensional

224
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,479
what are the multi-dimensional questions

225
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,160
so

226
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
when you look at this room for example

227
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,599
there are a lot of components here there

228
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,199
are a lot of different things you know

229
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,080
the chair podium all these things

230
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,919
in the list of these things list of

231
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,840
these verticals list of these pillars

232
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,240
these are these things

233
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,640
that's the horizontal view the vertical

234
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,919
view is

235
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
when you get down and focus and one of

236
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,559
these options one of these items

237
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,959
let's take that chair and talk about the

238
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,120
elements there talk about material talk

239
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
about everything that they put together

240
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
and now it's called chair

241
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,680
so

242
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,160
that is how we got to

243
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
the last point on this slide

244
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,880
this is interesting i mean very fair

245
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,959
question but how many elements are out

246
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,120
there let's go back to this room as you

247
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,160
see again there are so many elements and

248
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,760
you can talk

249
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,240
almost forever about each one of these

250
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,080
elements

251
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,000
here's an example

252
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,399
let's talk about the trip from l.a to

253
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,600
vegas

254
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
well there are a lot of different ways

255
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,120
to take that trap of course you can

256
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,959
drive yourself you can rent your rent a

257
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,680
car you could drive your own car or

258
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,760
you know what someone might want to take

259
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,440
a ride i want to ride my bike from my

260
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,959
way to vegas

261
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,519
these are all valid options but when you

262
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,519
focus on one of these options let's say

263
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,000
the road trip then you have the option

264
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,680
to rent a car and then more questions

265
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,959
are going to come up

266
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:45,519
all right how about

267
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
you know the company what's the best

268
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,959
price out there

269
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,640
how about availability how about

270
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
insurance can i use my own insurance or

271
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
something else as you see there is a

272
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,200
tree

273
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,480
almost

274
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,320
unlimited tree of questions

275
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,240
so

276
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
well the interviewer is going to look at

277
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,440
you and say

278
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
what if

279
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,519
i decide to just walk over to vegas

280
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
that's an option

281
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,600
i think that's a that is that's really

282
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,079
an acceptable behavior if really he or

283
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,480
she does that but sometimes it does not

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,480
happen sometimes what happens is after

285
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,800
the interview when they are rating you

286
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,399
or going through a debrief that's the

287
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
question comes up they covered

288
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,760
everything right they covered all the

289
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,480
possible options to go from la to vegas

290
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
but they forgot this option is a super

291
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,120
obvious thing how do you not know that

292
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
you could walk over

293
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
this is an old like just come on a

294
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,839
traditional you know developer is the

295
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,760
economic question is that i have a small

296
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,079
computer with limited memory and i want

297
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,200
to run this

298
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,320
giant's code on it but not so familiar

299
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,880
to the computer engineering

300
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,519
network engineering community

301
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,680
so

302
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,720
and

303
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,399
it eventually turns into a biased

304
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,560
interviewing process it turns into that

305
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
process that the person i mean the

306
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,279
interviewer is getting bored

307
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,200
second time and

308
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,880
you're not really hitting that very

309
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
answer

310
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
we talked about that question

311
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,920
the bgp confederation versus reflectors

312
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,760
that was one of the topics that we

313
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,680
talked about in previous presentation

314
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,839
that's a prime example of those there's

315
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,079
so many different things that when you

316
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,880
cover eventually someone is gonna is

317
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,399
gonna find something that you'd not

318
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,600
cover that

319
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,839
we talked about this

320
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,760
architecture great you can cover

321
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
probably eight nine items but you're not

322
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
gonna talk about memory consumption

323
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,839
configuration versus reflectors

324
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,920
and

325
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
that is what's going to happen

326
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,480
so

327
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,839
25 minutes later the candidate is lost

328
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,920
not talking about the topic you want at

329
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
the same time the interviewers running

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,079
out of time still have questions to

331
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,120
cover

332
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
and you're talking to one of the

333
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,079
brightest candidates this person might

334
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,720
be your best chance

335
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,480
so

336
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,920
what is that question that we want to

337
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
cover today

338
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,160
this is the question that came out of

339
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,040
this survey process you put this address

340
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
the url in the in the address box

341
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,399
and your favorite browser you might want

342
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,399
to use links you want you want want to

343
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,519
use google chrome firefox anything right

344
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,440
and what happens just walk me through

345
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,000
the steps tell me what happens when you

346
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,240
enter this url in that atlas box

347
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,639
this is one of the most instant looking

348
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,079
questions

349
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,880
and according to the community of 26

350
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,240
interviewers

351
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,800
uh most people most people they

352
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,000
interviewed

353
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,760
they call their dns

354
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,519
so the response to that question in most

355
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,320
cases the nts people will start on dns

356
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,639
you actually have some slides on it and

357
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,720
forget about all the other things but

358
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,040
let me tell you what those other things

359
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,399
are

360
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,399
so

361
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,600
this is what came out of the survey

362
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,839
i could not find two people agree on

363
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,920
same answer

364
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,320
this is scary isn't it

365
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,839
same question

366
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,880
26 interviewer each interview

367
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,240
hundreds of people let's say over a

368
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,399
thousand people so talk about 26 000

369
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,000
experience together

370
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,200
and

371
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
they have different points of view

372
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,760
interestingly it kind of goes back to

373
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,000
the background when you talk to people

374
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,440
coming from a systems engineering

375
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,200
background they expected

376
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,120
even in some cases to hear things like

377
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
the system calls

378
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,399
when you talk to people from network

379
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,160
engineering background

380
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,040
talk to me about you know the bhp bgpas

381
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,720
and all those things

382
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,000
so depending on the interview background

383
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the results of the survey kind of

384
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
changed interesting

385
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,519
how do you know was it candidate how do

386
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,600
i know as a candidate right i preferred

387
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
myself i spent two weeks to get ready

388
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,600
for this call or in-person interview and

389
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,160
use experience i'm getting

390
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,079
let's look at the possibilities just

391
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,240
some of the possibilities just to be

392
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,199
sure we're showing one example again

393
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,519
we're not trying to cover 10 interview

394
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,920
questions we're not trying to cover any

395
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,519
question 100

396
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,240
100 percent but what we're trying to do

397
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,240
is we just want to show the possible

398
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,040
layers that exist here and you might

399
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,160
miss

400
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,120
all the interviewer mightness

401
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
as we can imagine starts from layer one

402
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,079
and layer two goes all the way to the

403
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,680
hardware and how the hardware really

404
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,120
processes each one of these packets

405
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,600
here is an example

406
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,480
layer one you know dwdm is a complex

407
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,279
thing

408
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,720
and you know

409
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,639
everything pro i mean many things

410
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,639
probably about all the other layer one

411
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:54,160
stuff but

412
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,720
most people do not cover anything layer

413
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,120
one when they answer that question it's

414
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,360
not really technically a network

415
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,279
architect's job but

416
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,199
how do you know how do you know that is

417
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,760
really not part of the answer

418
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,199
how do you know it is not what they mean

419
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,560
layer 2

420
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,959
smart candidate is going to cover our

421
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,800
mac address let's find out what the mac

422
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,279
address is then let's structure the

423
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,120
packet this is how a packet is built

424
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,959
this is a layer 2

425
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,199
data here is a source destination the

426
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,399
entire

427
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,680
uh

428
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,120
header

429
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
let's talk about the venus let's talk

430
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,279
about the proxy our process and you know

431
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,399
all this stuff everything they're 100

432
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,839
valid answers

433
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,079
but what's left is there's a lot more

434
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,680
each hop

435
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,600
i expect this candidate to talk about

436
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,920
the behavior each one of these hops

437
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,639
so

438
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,240
that's the interest right you're going

439
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,639
from one router from here you're hopping

440
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,959
another one another one another one

441
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,360
you did not talk about it layer 2 is not

442
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,560
going to die

443
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,720
it exists but you cover just your laptop

444
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,959
the device that you're using its links

445
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,639
browser to put the url in

446
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,120
another interesting example the whole

447
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,120
running space

448
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,079
so

449
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,839
i guess the same candidate smart

450
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
candidate is going to cover

451
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,560
uh

452
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,199
the process from the computer that you

453
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,600
put in the address and most likely

454
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,360
you're going to have a default gateway

455
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,720
and you're going to contact default

456
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,680
gateway through the layer 2 process and

457
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,079
from there you're going to go out so of

458
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,519
course

459
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,680
there's going to be some local

460
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,320
routing setup within your building

461
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,480
you might cover that you might say all

462
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,880
right my building is running

463
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,199
ospf or

464
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,399
stub area with something else

465
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,320
and that's how i'm going to get out of

466
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,440
this room

467
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,120
that's how i'm going to get out of this

468
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
office

469
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,120
but look at this

470
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,240
all right

471
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,480
well the candidate was talking about the

472
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,440
laptop but i really meant a router and a

473
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,240
router had a very specific route and

474
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,079
that route

475
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,160
might have been pointing to the nautica

476
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,199
address

477
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,959
that's a different routing decision than

478
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,199
the default route

479
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,199
how do you know i have a default route

480
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,039
you never ask a question

481
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,359
now you see the problem here expectation

482
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,160
is

483
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,559
you ask clarification questions and you

484
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,039
find out where this

485
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,840
url is entered what kind of station is

486
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,200
requesting that web page and the

487
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,960
interviewer

488
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,039
is sitting there and expecting you to

489
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,080
cover

490
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,000
slash no

491
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
that part of the answer

492
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
you are making assumptions and those

493
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,880
assumptions not exactly what he or she

494
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,520
has in mind

495
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,000
another example

496
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,120
again

497
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,080
you were

498
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,520
trying to

499
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,919
route your traffic out of your network

500
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,880
and your answer is perfectly right but

501
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,200
guess what my candidate did not talk

502
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,120
about the convergence process

503
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,720
how do you know the network wasn't going

504
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
through convergence how do you know the

505
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,320
network wasn't going through congestion

506
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,720
encapsulation is another one you made

507
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,160
assumption that there is no

508
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,360
encapsulation nothing going on

509
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,240
guess what i expected him or her to talk

510
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,360
about

511
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,120
an ipsec tunnel ssl tunnel kind of vpn

512
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,520
tunnel on this laptop when you put in

513
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,640
the command

514
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,720
that's a possibility for god to talk

515
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,039
about that possibility just made the

516
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,679
assumption that i'm running this command

517
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,840
absolutely natively and neither that's

518
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,200
right but

519
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,080
now

520
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,200
i had

521
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,760
ipsec and they forgot to cover ipsec or

522
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,600
any kind of vpn that i was running on my

523
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,120
laptop where i could have been running

524
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,760
on my laptop

525
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,880
bgp same thing again a smart candidate

526
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,880
is going to cover all that for you i'm

527
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,400
going to talk about the port number i'm

528
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
going to talk about all these top

529
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,120
asses all these circuits double decision

530
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,679
process even i'm going to cover the uh

531
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,480
two byte versus four bytes how the as

532
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
updates are sent and the whole story

533
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,480
with that uh you know as number

534
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,760
but

535
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,360
here is a problem

536
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,840
this is a lot more than just native hdp

537
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,320
routing how do you know your service

538
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,720
provider and running npos in the

539
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,080
backbone

540
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,840
for internet is possible

541
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,640
so these are all different possibilities

542
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,679
that

543
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,720
eventually to disconnect between the

544
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,520
interviewer and interview

545
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,640
and

546
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
these are really interesting cases

547
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,520
especially when you look at the go again

548
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
going back to that wrath reflector

549
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,799
versus wrath

550
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,679
versus pgp configuration design

551
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,960
there's so many possibilities out there

552
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
with draft protectors

553
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,240
occurs i mean

554
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,760
uh

555
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
there's a lot to cover including the

556
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,120
memory optimization that we talked about

557
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
and most people

558
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
kind of skip that part but

559
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,200
configurations also could have rash

560
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
reflectors

561
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
but guess what even in pls network you

562
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,720
can't have

563
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
graph reflectors

564
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,440
i actually have a session i've presented

565
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,960
a few years ago we're talking about ipv6

566
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,000
connecting ipv6 islands using mpos and

567
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,080
serious provided backbone

568
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,120
and these are all possibilities that

569
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,880
fair game

570
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
yeah i meant it and he or she never

571
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,280
covered those at least they could have

572
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,799
asked

573
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,600
but how do i know that i need to ask all

574
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,039
those questions about each one of the

575
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
steps as you notice

576
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,000
now that we have this horizontal view

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,480
now you look at each one of the towers

578
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,039
possibilities of endless

579
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,080
and

580
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
interrupting the interviewer asking

581
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,120
questions each steps at least would make

582
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
me feel uncomfortable i don't want to

583
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,679
you know ask the 25 questions to answer

584
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:06,799
one question

585
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,799
but this is exactly where you're headed

586
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,600
another interesting thing there is so

587
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,679
much more when you talk about writing

588
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,440
and these are all the things that people

589
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,919
mention the candidates covered rather

590
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,440
than i absolutely love this it was

591
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,919
perfect coverage right but assumption

592
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,440
was i had no ecmp going on i had no load

593
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,280
sharing going on i had no hashing

594
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,080
algorithm going on uh did not talk about

595
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,159
really you know how different writers

596
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,320
handle different kinds of traffic

597
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,559
and it's important these things are

598
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,159
important

599
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:40,960
and

600
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,799
interestingly

601
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,120
uh at least in two cases as far as i

602
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
remember

603
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,120
people mentioned that they use the depth

604
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,679
of information provided here to

605
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,880
determine the level of a candidate

606
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,520
so if you're hiring an engineer

607
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
covers this much

608
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,679
for a principal level let's go all the

609
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:02,799
way down

610
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,080
oh yeah

611
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,120
he or she saw all these things

612
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,880
and you were talking about every single

613
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,000
detail

614
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,159
but keep in mind it's almost impossible

615
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,799
to cover all these things it's just the

616
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,679
small list of possibilities here so if

617
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,080
you're just leveling your candidates

618
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,440
based on the amount of information

619
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,039
presented here it is endless

620
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,640
so dns

621
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,320
interesting thing that's probably how

622
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,400
this whole question is born

623
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,159
because that's how people cover that

624
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:34,960
right

625
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
everybody knows about the dns

626
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,960
hierarchical model i'm gonna

627
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,120
i'm going to talk about my device i will

628
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,679
go to my resolver no

629
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,000
do you know or you not know depending on

630
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,320
that we're going to make a decision

631
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,320
and he can just jump up

632
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,159
ask question

633
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,840
one level down one level down one level

634
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,280
down eventually hit the right hand

635
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,280
server get the answer and we're done

636
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,360
that's how it works

637
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,199
now let's see what's hidden there

638
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,159
these are just four answers for short

639
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,720
answers out of the survey interesting

640
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,919
right

641
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,440
most people make assumption that there

642
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,720
are three

643
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,960
route dns servers out there one

644
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,480
interview told me that that's the wrong

645
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,799
answer

646
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,200
well there are three dns roots out there

647
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,080
for all right roots out there but these

648
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,200
are they're not

649
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,600
13 servers

650
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,440
they're not 13 dns servers they're more

651
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,120
than 30 and some of them are clustered

652
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,720
or some other designs

653
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
13 servers mean 13 computers that's

654
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,080
that's this wrong statement

655
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,919
next one

656
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,440
the candidate to answer the question the

657
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,000
asset was perfect but these days at

658
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,720
least let's say past two or three years

659
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,960
many many service providers cloud

660
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,880
providers hyperscalers

661
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,279
they do dns

662
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,080
to make sure that the the integrity of

663
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,400
your pockets responses

664
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,120
are preserved uh

665
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,760
i did not cover that at all

666
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,120
it's important

667
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,360
another interesting thing the whole gso

668
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
video here

669
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,840
cloud-based on-prem

670
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,480
canada did not cover that either

671
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,200
how do you know my network

672
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,679
or their network or whoever's network

673
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,000
is not using jsov

674
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,120
uh

675
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,200
that is a possibility that they should

676
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,679
have talked about it they did not

677
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,520
and local files

678
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,080
how many people here know what lmo's lm

679
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,640
host file is we remember what that is it

680
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
was

681
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,480
back in the days there was the wind

682
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,679
server

683
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,559
yeah and some people would use that file

684
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,960
pretty similar to host file as an

685
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,200
existing or i guess but

686
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,080
yeah possibility we should have covered

687
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,000
you know host file now the local files

688
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,559
that help the name resolution process

689
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,559
also the local cash

690
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,400
how much detail do you need about local

691
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,279
cash

692
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,720
canada did not cover any of those

693
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,240
and uh

694
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,159
that was an interesting one

695
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,640
one of the favorite topics that my

696
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,120
candidates talked about dns i'm going to

697
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,760
ask them about the port number

698
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,400
it said dns port udp 53. it's wrong

699
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,279
answer

700
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,760
sometimes tcp i mean we have zone

701
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,840
transfers right

702
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,039
um

703
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,799
i guess

704
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,039
as you see it's rat hole really there's

705
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,120
no end to this conversation if you want

706
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,480
to push it

707
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
and the candidate does not know exactly

708
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
what you mean or where you're going

709
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,840
could be absolutely

710
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,000
confusing and interesting thing

711
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,440
people with systems engineering

712
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,760
background gave me some really very

713
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,760
interesting answers so

714
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,640
uh

715
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,400
one of them is expecting candidates to

716
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,120
run the um some kind of tracing

717
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,520
commander linux box and know the

718
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,200
system calls

719
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
i guess that's kind of not fair for

720
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,320
network engineering interviews but

721
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,360
uh

722
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,279
how do you know about operating system

723
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,720
you're making assumptions you're making

724
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,320
assumption that's a windows operating

725
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,440
system

726
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,760
uh it could have been something else

727
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,840
and security had its own whole chapter

728
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
of topics

729
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,919
different access lists different filters

730
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,000
all different things the candidate did

731
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,840
not cover any of those just may

732
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,240
assumption that is a wide open network

733
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,159
and packets are traversing from left to

734
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,360
right and that's how we got to nanak.org

735
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,039
and that's why you have the pitch here

736
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,720
no there are a lot of security devices

737
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,480
here did not talk about inspection

738
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,559
process

739
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,799
and

740
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,120
i guess just to summarize this some

741
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
interesting uh

742
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,320
feedback

743
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,559
for us really for us for whoever is

744
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,240
interviewing people

745
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,720
we gotta be fair once i caught myself

746
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,080
many years ago

747
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,720
not recently many years ago we're hiring

748
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,960
an enterprise network engineer

749
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,760
and

750
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,760
halfway through the interview myself

751
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,960
asking

752
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,000
uh inter vpn option b questions

753
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,679
i mean

754
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,320
did you have mpls now we did not were

755
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,840
asking

756
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,600
were you exactly expecting get out of

757
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,240
that back then right my thought process

758
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,200
was

759
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,440
if he knows that

760
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,760
he knows definitely knows my stuff so

761
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,240
i'm going to cover that thing that like

762
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,200
uh

763
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,440
far far thing on horizon

764
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,520
and i'm making assumption that he knows

765
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,039
that

766
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,360
he must know this one this is real basic

767
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,360
this is wrong interview approach i

768
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
decided to stop doing that

769
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,320
another thing was the

770
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,480
feedback process and the constant

771
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,080
communication between the interviewer

772
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,720
and the interviewee it's really key if

773
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,000
the interviewer

774
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,760
if you were interviewing someone and you

775
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,279
feel the capital is not on the right

776
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,320
track you are not putting the candidate

777
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,600
on the right track you're putting the

778
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,279
interview on the right track

779
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,960
and penalties losing points it's an

780
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,360
absolute bad approach

781
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,960
you have to ask a question whether your

782
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,480
question is clear enough for a candidate

783
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,320
to answer or

784
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,919
it's absolutely fair to have some

785
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,520
ambiguity and see how they kind of deal

786
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,159
with that but at the end of the day it's

787
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,640
your interview and you have to make sure

788
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,320
that the candidate is on the right track

789
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
and answering your questions and let's

790
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,960
avoid the guess what i'm thinking model

791
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,120
uh we had this in the previous

792
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,200
presentation and

793
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,679
we covered that that's absolutely not

794
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,399
fair so this was just one of those

795
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,559
examples what came out of

796
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,520
the survey that all conducted based on

797
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,600
feedback from the previous not

798
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,919
presentation and

799
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,919
i personally liked it i actually started

800
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
using many of these lessons

801
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,480
and i hope

802
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
uh everybody else

803
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,159
finds it informative thank you so much

804
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,159
for again being here pay attention to

805
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,320
this session i know it's uh

806
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,440
5 30 pm almost so really appreciate

807
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,679
everyone's attention thank you

808
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,679
peace

809
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,799
[Applause]

810
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,279
thank you cam for the presentation um

811
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,039
we'll take any questions we have about a

812
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,720
minute

813
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,360
anyone from the live audience that wants

814
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,840
to ask

815
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,480
name and affiliation please still it air

816
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,159
still internet too

817
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,799
um based on your slides as a security

818
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,799
engineer i do have to ask

819
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,279
why does your router have a web browser

820
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,120
on it

821
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,880
you know these days it's

822
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,799
absolutely wrong practice but you know

823
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,480
these days is possible to even run an

824
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,640
operating system on a router yes a whole

825
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,360
different operating system

826
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,520
security engineer actually

827
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,399
somebody asked ask the same question and

828
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,960
you're right you're right

829
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,279
oh yeah totally i agree with you

830
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,039
i hear it to you

831
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,000
yep

832
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,440
so i mean one of the big things you

833
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,360
focused on was how multi-dimensional

834
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,880
questions can get just

835
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,039
way off in the weeds in

836
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,120
unconscious mind absolutely yes what

837
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,559
about if you're interviewing on a

838
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,279
a role where you want to see

839
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,159
how deeply they can troubleshoot or you

840
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,039
want to know how they think laterally

841
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,960
how do you get both

842
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,799
that problem-solving ethos without the

843
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,880
gotcha type you know thing you warned

844
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,640
about yeah let's see let me do my best

845
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,399
to answer that question right because we

846
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,120
had that problem too and

847
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,520
the way we answer that question or may

848
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,880
or may not work for you but i will give

849
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,080
you the answer uh we do homework so we

850
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,320
do we give candida a scenario you take

851
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,919
the scenario home

852
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,799
study that scenario build something

853
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,799
you come on someone's going to join that

854
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,960
call interview number one we're going to

855
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
do a quick break and fix we're going to

856
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,919
ask questions we're going to do a break

857
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,000
and fix hands-on troubleshooting we'll

858
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,600
see how it works

859
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,440
some people like it some people do not

860
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,799
like it but

861
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,240
that is probably the i guess fairest way

862
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,519
uh it's mutual right for us to see how

863
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,000
hard zone you are and for you to show

864
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,760
your hands-on skills

865
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,640
i in the best results again go to the

866
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,120
candidates with uh

867
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,799
a lot of hands-on experience especially

868
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,640
people studying for certifications those

869
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,960
things absolutely hands-on a bunch of

870
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,880
show commands troubleshooting capture

871
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,200
this filter that here's a result that's

872
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,720
how that's why it's broken this is how

873
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,279
we fix it but uh

874
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:36,320
not super useful for sales engineers for

875
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,399
consulting engineers we're not so hands

876
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,159
on mostly whiteboard people

877
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,120
for

878
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,279
that kind of interview or i can see a

879
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,600
smile for that kind of interview

880
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,240
yeah we still do whiteboard and you got

881
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
to structure the interview in a you know

882
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,519
useful way

883
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,519
we usually use

884
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,799
paper for example output of bgp show

885
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,080
commands right

886
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,360
and

887
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,360
it would change some lines and some

888
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,720
stuff in that

889
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,559
this is a broken network

890
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,840
um

891
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,320
that works that worked too but i

892
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,559
personally like the live troubleshooting

893
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,080
sessions better okay

894
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,519
and i'm not data and i'm not the

895
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,039
candidate

896
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:15,840
so

897
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
the fact that i like it i'm sitting on

898
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,440
the other side of the table no sorry

899
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,799
we're out of time

900
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,120
you are okay

901
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,000

of people we can do surveys and we can

910
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,640
put our heads together see how we can

911
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,559
