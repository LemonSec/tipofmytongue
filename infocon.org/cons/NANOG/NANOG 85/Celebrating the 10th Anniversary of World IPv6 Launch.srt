00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,720
hello my name is scott hogg and today

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,040
i'll be discussing the 10th anniversary

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,840
of world ipv6 launch and celebrating the

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,559
successes over the past decade

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,320
i'll also be talking about what remains

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,439
to be accomplished in the years to come

8
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
today i'm representing the various ipv6

9
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,240
task force groups in north america

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
after the tragic passing of jim bound in

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,679
2009 the north american ipv6 task force

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,760
became a collection of geographically

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,079
dispersed ipv6 groups

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,239
all with the same original mission that

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,760
jim envisioned

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,160
early on there were ipv6 task force

17
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,559
groups like the mid-atlantic canadian

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:43,920
hawaiian

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,399
latin american caribbean groups

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,640
but these listed here the active ipv6

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,199
task forces that support the global ipv6

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,920
forum's goals of furthering ipv6

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,680
adoption worldwide

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,840
in the past these groups have organized

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,559
ipv6 events and evangelized for the use

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,280
of ipv6 i'm the chair emeritus of the

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,960
rocky mountain ipv6 task force

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
first a bit of history for those gen z

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,080
or gen alpha people among us who may not

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,159
know what transpired well over a decade

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,280
ago or rather maybe a quick refresher

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,200
for those of us like me who are older

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,880
and have poor memories

34
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
well world ipv6 day was a 24 hour dual

35
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,479
protocol enablement test

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,840
on june 8

37
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,159
2011 was sponsored by the internet

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,040
society and many commercial customers

39
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,439
to determine the impact and percentage

40
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,159
of broken ipv6 connectivity that existed

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,600
on the internet

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
thanks to improvements to products host

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,399
operating systems connectivity

44
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,560
happy eyeballs the amount of ipv6

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,399
brokenness was less than previously

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,680
feared

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
the following year was world ipv6 launch

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,600
on june 6 2012 and it aimed to promote

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,240
permanent dual protocol enablement so

50
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,719
content providers like facebook google

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,680
microsoft bing yahoo akamai and

52
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,240
limelight networks vowed to configure

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,800
a quad a record for the primary websites

54
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
and leave it on permanently

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,760
service providers like at t comcast free

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,640
telecom internode kddi

57
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,520
time warner cable and xs for all vowed

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,239
to

59
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,200
enable ipv6 for enough of their users

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,520
and subscribers at least one percent of

61
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,680
their wireline residential subscribers

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
would have ipv6 and equipment

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
manufacturers like cisco and d-link

64
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,280
vowed to have ipv6 capable cpe for their

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,720
subscribers

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,360
this event helped break the log jam that

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
ipv6 previously experienced

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
today we celebrate the accomplishments

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,200
of so many people it's been 10 years

70
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,319
since world ipv6 launch and content

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,239
providers have left their primary

72
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,200
websites running dual protocol isps have

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,400
continued to increase their ipv6 enabled

74
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,360
subscribers well beyond one percent to

75
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,480
50 80 or even 90

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,959
cpe vendors and many other manufacturers

77
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,560
have given countle have given us

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,680
countless ipv6 capable products uh we're

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,519
honoring this success and voicing our

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,319
gratitude to these people and companies

81
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
and we'll be reviewing the process about

82
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,440
progress

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,760
also note we're not taking credit for

84
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,120
any of this progress but rather

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,360
recognizing those who have put in

86
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,640
tremendous effort to make this happen

87
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,519
without ipv6 products

88
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,840
we would never have ipv6 internet

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,400
connectivity content providers couldn't

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
ipv6 enable their sites and end users

91
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,760
couldn't access that ipv6 enabled

92
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,280
content

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,799
these companies out of the goodness of

94
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,640
their hearts gave us ipv6 enabled

95
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,319
products because they recognized it was

96
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,760
the right thing to do

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,000
now we have many categories of ipv6

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,720
enabled products companies like android

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,319
google apple

100
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,680
uh arista aruba hpe

101
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,640
broadcom cisco comscope

102
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,599
fortinet juniper linux

103
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,480
microsoft palo alto networks technicolor

104
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,120
vmware among many others have given us

105
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,280
products that we require

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,920
to further ipv6 adoption

107
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,199
we also have product testing

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,040
organizations that are making sure that

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,040
these products conform to the standards

110
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,000
tier 1 isps and internet exchanges

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,520
we need to thank them

112
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,680
they've worked so hard to establish ipv6

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,199
connectivity in the fabric of the

114
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,320
internet

115
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,479
thankfully isps seemingly don't charge

116
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,800
any more for dual protocol connectivity

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,919
than ipv4 only internet connectivity

118
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,440
service providers recognize the

119
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,479
inevitable

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,280
transition to ipv6 and how much of the

121
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,759
internet runs now much of the internet

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,840
runs both protocols some service

123
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,919
providers recognize the operational

124
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,240
efficiencies of running single protocol

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,960
core network and now have an ipv6 only

126
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
core network

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,600
while still facilitating ipv4 subscriber

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,720
connectivity using ipv4 as a service

129
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
techniques

130
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
thanks to those exchanges and peering

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,199
points for supporting the

132
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,160
interconnection of the ipv6 internet

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,320
credit to all of those who have ipv6

134
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,639
enabled root name servers without ipv6

135
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
enabled dns and bgp we couldn't have an

136
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,479
ipv6 internet and since world ipv6

137
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,479
launched now all root name servers have

138
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,039
both a and quad a records thanks for

139
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,759
turning ipv6 on by default

140
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,600
we should also give thanks to those

141
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
organizations that have ipv6 enabled

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,320
their authoritative name servers as well

143
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,199
we now have ipv6 connectivities in our

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
pockets purses and packs

145
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
the majority of mobile devices have ipv6

146
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,120
reachability on their 4g and 5g networks

147
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,360
thanks to the tremendous efforts

148
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,039
of those mobile service providers and

149
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,800
their employees these companies

150
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,479
recognize that they couldn't continue to

151
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,120
scale their businesses and support the

152
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,759
ever growing number of mobile devices

153
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,880
solely using ipv4 thanks for not making

154
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
subscribers ask for ipv6 before it got

155
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,919
enabled ipv6 on by default brilliant

156
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,639
we apologize for excluding any company

157
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,120
from this slide some service providers

158
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,199
may not have their ipv6 subscriber

159
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,280
numbers tracked by the world ipv6

160
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,280
measurement site

161
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,639
also we bold uh highlight companies that

162
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,360
were part of the original world ipv6

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
launch participant

164
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,440
now many of us have ipv6 connectivity at

165
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,199
our homes and businesses thanks to the

166
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
work of these residential broadband isps

167
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,639
these carriers have over 50 percent of

168
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,600
their subscribers using ipv6 we

169
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,199
highlight and bold

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,800
those companies that participated in

171
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,880
world ipv6 launch

172
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
as a result of these carrier deployments

173
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,120
we now have significant number of ipv6

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,280
users in north american countries

175
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,919
it's estimated that we have 124 million

176
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,039
ipv6 subscribers in the united states uh

177
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,280
40.4 million in mexico 11.7 in canada

178
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,440
and 3 million in guatemala

179
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
thanks to those companies that have ipv6

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
enabled their websites now with

181
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,599
statistically significant percentage of

182
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,160
websites are using ipv6

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,880
although there's much work to do here to

184
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
increase the rate of ipv6 adoption for

185
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,560
smaller sites

186
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,039
from this w3 text graph we see that the

187
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,440
higher ranked the website is the more

188
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,840
likely it is to use ipv6

189
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,199
coincidence also the world ipv6

190
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,720
measurement site reports that the

191
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
percentage of the alexa top 1000

192
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,000
websites currently uh using ipv6 is

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,840
around 32 percent

194
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
i got a fortune cookie the other day and

195
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,160
it said 47.2 percent of all statistics

196
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,440
are made up

197
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,039
i kind of suspect the number is higher

198
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,160
than that

199
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,720
but seriously though uh

200
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,440
all we know is that ipv6 measurements

201
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,360
are dependent on where the measurement

202
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,479
is taken

203
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,240
and the perspective of the internet from

204
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
that vantage point so your mileage may

205
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,599
vary any ipv6 presentation would not be

206
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,120
complete without a screenshot of the

207
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,919
google ipv6 statistics graph from

208
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
google's worldwide perspective of the

209
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
internet ipv6 continues to increase at a

210
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,639
steady pace we want to explore how we

211
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,039
can accelerate this

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
facebook one of the original world ipv6

213
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,639
launch participates participants now has

214
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,319
the majority of their internet traffic

215
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,960
using ipv6 in many countries these

216
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,520
graphs show ipv6

217
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,000
from their members in the united states

218
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,479
over you know and in other words from

219
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,039
this graph we can see that ipv4 is

220
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,360
becoming the minority protocol many

221
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,839
thanks to the content delivery networks

222
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,000
that have ipv6 enabled websites around

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,399
the world in addition to improving the

224
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,480
performance of that content

225
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
even if the origin fetch is still

226
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,760
happening over ipv4 only on the back end

227
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,240
we can still recognize the progress

228
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
we also want to recognize those cdns

229
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,839
that make websites reachable over ipv6

230
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,200
by default

231
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,360
my guess is that most cdn customers may

232
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,959
not know to ask for ipv6 and may not

233
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,680
know how to enable ipv6 cdn services

234
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
themselves

235
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
so dual protocol should be the default

236
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,120
setting again i apologize if we've

237
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,839
excluded any company here these are the

238
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,080
companies that came to mind and bold

239
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,279
highlighting

240
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,120
shows those companies that supported the

241
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,680
original world ipv6 launch back in 2012.

242
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,720
akamai also shows us ipv6 traffic

243
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
percentages from their global

244
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
perspective although there's statistics

245
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,800
vary from time to time i can't say that

246
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
i'm knowledgeable about how they collect

247
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
these statistics but we can see that

248
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
optimized connections from mexico use

249
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,519
ipv6 40 percent of the time

250
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,320
also at the very top of akamai's ipv6

251
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
adoption

252
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,880
statistics by country is montserrat at

253
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,279
59.7

254
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,000
and

255
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,399
that's the same font that's used in this

256
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,120
presentation another coincidence i think

257
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
not

258
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,399
although many of these cloud service

259
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,240
providers with the exception of google

260
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
weren't around back in the world ipv6

261
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
launch era

262
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,279
they've worked diligently to ipv6 enable

263
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,560
their services

264
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,320
while the majority of their initial

265
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
services offerings were ipv4 it's taken

266
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,160
them much effort to retool those

267
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,000
services for dual protocol connectivity

268
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,680
a lesson for the rest of us when making

269
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,360
a new product or service it's easier to

270
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,200
make it dual protocol right from the

271
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,640
start rather than add ipv6 capability as

272
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,160
an afterthought once it's in production

273
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
while there are cloud services that

274
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
enable ipd6 by default like aws

275
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,959
cloudfront distributions microsoft azure

276
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,320
cdn

277
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,399
however the vast majority of public

278
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,480
cloud infrastructures of service

279
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
services

280
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,360
must have ipv6 enabled manually and many

281
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,160
of their customers are not enabling ipv6

282
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,480
within their infrastructures codes

283
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
software driven

284
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,240
devops practices

285
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
people thinking about the evolution of

286
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,880
ipv6 transition has changed over the

287
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720
years back in 2005 to 2015 you know dual

288
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,560
stack was the battle cry

289
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
well because tunneling

290
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,320
just made us cry

291
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,519
now as ipv6 has evolved and shown that

292
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,320
it can be robust the aim is to start to

293
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
use ipv6 only whenever possible the

294
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,519
recent u.s federal cio mandate m2107

295
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,959
and many countries around the world are

296
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,959
striving to achieve ipv6 only

297
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,640
connectivity

298
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,800
but for most enterprises it seems

299
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,200
daunting and infeasible to have ipv6

300
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
only network transport

301
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,880
because there are still ipv4

302
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,279
dependencies in many it products and

303
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,720
services

304
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,639
so now what's next what still needs to

305
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,720
be done what's left to do

306
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,360
what thorns remain enterprises continue

307
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,680
to struggle with ipv6 they fail to

308
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
recognize the amount of ipv6 usage on

309
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,079
the internet used by their own remote

310
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,480
employees their customers their partners

311
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,600
vendors suppliers etc

312
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
i t personnel lack knowledge and are not

313
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,360
seeking training to learn about the

314
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,480
protocol

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,399
so many enterprises haven't even

316
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,000
formulated a plan

317
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,519
they're confused about the number of

318
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,040
dynamic ipd6 address assignment methods

319
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
and they want to have the same

320
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,360
operational practices they do for ipv6

321
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
as they do for ipv4

322
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,440
namely dhcp

323
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,959
many enterprises struggle with

324
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,200
multi-homing without bgp they have a

325
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,000
tendency and want to use nat 66 because

326
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,920
it's what they're familiar with

327
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,160
and thanks to those vpn providers who

328
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,040
provide privacy for both v4 and v6 we

329
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,000
know who you are we appreciate you

330
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
but you don't need to keep your ipv6

331
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,440
capabilities such a secret cdns clouds

332
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,279
hosting providers may not be turning

333
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,720
ipv6 on by default their customers

334
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
just like the website users don't want

335
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,920
to have to ask about ipv6 and they may

336
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,560
not know even what ipv6 is and why they

337
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,120
should even ask in the first place

338
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,600
uh there are still well documented and

339
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,519
frequently discussed issues related to

340
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,839
handling of ipv6 packets with extension

341
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,000
headers and fragmentation headers

342
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
although we see hope in this in this

343
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
topic

344
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,320
there's also going to be an ipv6 panel

345
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,079
of experts later today who are going to

346
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,560
cover these topics uh more deeply about

347
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,720
where we go from here so we applaud all

348
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,880
of your efforts thank you

349
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,720
we recognize all the hard work that went

350
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
into getting us to this point the

351
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
countless hours the testing the

352
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,320
configuration preparations the late

353
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,000
night change windows that led to where

354
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,279
we are today

355
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,760
or maybe you just cowboyed ipv6 in

356
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
during a change window during the day

357
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,320
it's ipv6 after all

358
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
so i'll pause for a moment while you all

359
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,079
give yourself a round of applause

360
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,040
now we can't stop now the mission isn't

361
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,040
accomplished there's much work that

362
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,320
remains to get us to the ideal ipv6 on

363
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,399
by default and ipv6 only end state

364
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,639
as we in the task forces like to say

365
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,880
forget your a game now it's time to

366
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,519
bring your quad a game

367
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,199
if ever you need to contact the north

368
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,519
american ipv6 task force groups here's

369
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,760
how to reach us here's my contact

370
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,160
information if you have any ipv6 related

371
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,240
questions for me

372
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,920
thank you very much for your time and

373
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
all that you have done to further ipv6

374
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,480
adoption over the recent decade

375
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880
now i'll be able to answer ipv6 related

376
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,680
questions you may have

377
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,120

382
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,279
hi everybody

383
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,680
nothing on the q a tab we have one in

384
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,199
the audience down there go ahead sir

385
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,439
mike

386
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,360
on hi i'm josh oaks from telstra one of

387
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,440
the things i noticed was the residential

388
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,320
broadband users were significantly lower

389
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,160
than other organizations in overall

390
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,440
adoption

391
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,560
what can we do to help nudge them along

392
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
with you know

393
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
we bringing the eyeballs into uh the

394
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,120
auto option of ipv6

395
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,959
i think the service providers you know

396
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,199
continue to upgrade their infrastructure

397
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,440
their you know broadband network

398
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,399
gateways their dslams their cmts's you

399
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,160
know there's there's continuing work to

400
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,839
upgrade the software

401
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,839
uh and upgrade those systems um

402
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,880
you need to get

403
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,320
subscribers to you know churn the cte

404
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,759
you know we need to

405
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
we need a little more you know

406
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,639
electrical spikes and

407
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,120
power to kill the you know little two

408
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,680
dollar power adapter on those devices to

409
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,920
cause refresh

410
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,639
many cpu devices like i mentioned like

411
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,600
cdns or an is provider may not come with

412
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
ipv6 enabled by default ipv6 may need to

413
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,639
be something that the subscriber needs

414
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,440
to go in and turn on on their little

415
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,959
you know home router if it's not

416
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,079
integrated

417
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,040
if that

418
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,880
device is integrated if the router is

419
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,320
integrated with the

420
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,480
you know cable modem or dsl modem then

421
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
it's easy for the service provider to

422
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,320
have some control over that and turn on

423
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,120
ipd6 by default but for many

424
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,000
you know subscriber purchase devices

425
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
they may need to go in and turn that on

426
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,120
by default so we really need to

427
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
encourage cpe manufacturers to have

428
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,720
you know ipv6 enabled by default on

429
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,680
those devices that would that would help

430
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,000
thank you

431
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
thank you

432
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,800
we got one more stepping up

433
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,000
hi this is michael costello from netflix

434
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,160
so a lot of the things that you touched

435
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,679
on uh were about enabling uh v6 in more

436
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,079
places and during the keynote today

437
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,760
there was the

438
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,359
the question of besides ipv4

439
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,640
reachability does ipv6 work for

440
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,039
consumers and the the answer was sadly

441
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,919
no and so often even now 10 years in

442
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,760
we're seeing that the first step in

443
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,400
troubleshooting v6 is to is to disable

444
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,720
it so what are the things that the

445
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,200
people in this room could be doing what

446
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,960
are some concrete steps we can take to

447
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
make the the v6 experience

448
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
uh less broken and and less of a second

449
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,799
class citizen

450
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,679
i'd say you know improve well

451
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,840
it's important to tr your training is is

452
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,960
so important training is important for

453
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,440
you know for help desk folks

454
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,679
they need to be knowledgeable about ipv6

455
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,679
so they don't you know go to that

456
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,760
knee-jerk reaction of just disabling it

457
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,919
because they don't understand it

458
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,799
uh so understanding is one understanding

459
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,679
the protocol that they're

460
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,440
troubleshooting is important because

461
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
maybe they could resolve the problem

462
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,720
faster

463
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,200
instead of just turning it off two they

464
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,679
need tools to give them visibility and

465
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,440
the ability to troubleshoot you know

466
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,960
they don't just need to do a ping over

467
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,280
v4 and a ping over v6 that's two two

468
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
steps what if they just did a single

469
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
ping command and it pinged all the

470
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,679
addresses that responded to a fully

471
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,440
qualified domain name whether that was

472
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,400
v4 or v6 or both and we need tools to be

473
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,960
able to to do both and test both

474
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,280
automatically to reduce the mean time to

475
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,480
repair

476
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,400
if we had knowledge

477
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,080
tools visibility techniques procedures

478
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,720
i think we could resolve problems faster

479
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,039
and not have to move to that you know

480
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,840
turn off ipv6 and that fixed it

481
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,440
you know solution

482
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,720
those are my

483
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,039
ideas off the top of my head

484
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,200
thank you

485
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,390
thank you michael and that wraps it up

486
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,480
[Music]

487
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,559
you
