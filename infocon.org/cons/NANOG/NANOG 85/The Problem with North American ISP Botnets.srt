2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,839
i would like to introduce craig lapovitz

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,599
who will be presenting the problem with

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,400
north american isp botnets

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,360
craig is cto at nokia deep field and has

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,760
traveled here from ann arbor michigan

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,199
craig has been contributing to nanog

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
since nanog 1 held in ann arbor in 1994

9
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,560
but has been presenting to multiple tech

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,760
events

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,840
long before nanog was formed

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,240
since then he's spoken at analog 17

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,399
times and is a valuable contributor to

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,559
this organization and our community as a

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,680
whole

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
welcome back to the nanox stage craig

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,399
great well thank you for that

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,320
introduction

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,879
so today i'll be speaking about the

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,760
problem with north american isp botnets

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,719
and before i go into botnets a few words

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
just about ddos in general

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,039
so for better for worse i've been doing

24
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,039
ddos for quite a bit of my career

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,680
through multiple different vendors

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,000
and for most of my career four things

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,159
were more or less true

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,680
ddos was growing ddos is always growing

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,840
historically most ddos was due to

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,400
amplification these are misconfigured

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,439
dns any dns sec has been a wonderful

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,439
thing for ddos

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,520
misconfigured memcache cldap and so on

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,600
historically most ddos was actually from

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,560
russia

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,159
china other parts of the world to the us

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,040
attacking you know day after day

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
and despite what jeff says and the

39
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,880
previous talk

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
uh flowspec actually is pretty good for

41
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,079
amplification and we've seen really over

42
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,600
the last five years

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,079
as the technology has matured bugs

44
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,799
addressed uh fairly widespread adoption

45
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,280
of flowspec but traditionally flowspec

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,479
was used in very very limited ways

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,119
mostly just to block amplification not

48
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,759
really for all the other attacks where

49
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,000
you would traditionally need to use an

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,399
appliance a scrubber you know

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,479
specialized ddos vendors

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,720
so for most of the 20 years

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,959
all this was true though again flospec

54
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,440
really only last five years

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,160
it turns out in

56
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,800
2022

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,440
only the first is still true

58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,680
and i'll be talking about the changes in

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
the ddos market and anti-ddos market

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
and why the last three bullet points are

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
no longer true

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,280
as of june 2022

63
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,120
so ddos is growing

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,879
we have data that shows up and to the

65
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,920
right cloudfront excuse me cloudflare

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,840
has tr graphs showing up to the right

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,800
google

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
you know all vendors more or less agree

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,319
it's up and to the right

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,319
and it's up and to the right for really

71
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,319
four reasons or five

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,440
one is thanks to bitcoin we now have

73
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,120
just a massive uptick in

74
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,480
pseudo-anonymized extortion

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,440
much easier to do thanks to bitcoin

76
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,920
we're seeing a real uptick in ddos with

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
theft and intrusion

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
i.e using ddos to overwhelm firewall and

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
other security devices

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,599
gamers have always been a large part of

81
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,879
ddos

82
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,400
what's different now

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
is the price to launch ddos has cratered

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,280
over the last three years

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,799
so it's not that there's more gamers

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,040
though there might be but it really is

87
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,000
launching a ddos is way way cheaper than

88
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,120
it used to be and then the other reasons

89
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,040
are mostly thanks to you and your

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,159
customers

91
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,840
thanks to you and your customers there

92
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,799
are now

93
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,959
thousands and hundreds of thousands of

94
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,239
compromised servers and iot consumer in

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,879
enterprise devices and thanks to you and

96
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,760
your customers they're now gig connected

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,120
in 5g

98
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,360
so much higher speeds

99
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,519
across these many thousands of different

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,840
devices

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
what

102
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,439
has cratered though is the price

103
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,239
this is showing the average price in u.s

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,280
dollars

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,720
to launch a hundred gigabit ddos attack

106
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,799
there's a various blogs i grabbed one of

107
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,599
them but all the blogs kind of agree

108
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,599
that we went from give or take hundreds

109
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,358
of dollars or a thousand dollars in 2018

110
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,839
to an average retail price

111
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,479
of 25 in bitcoin

112
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,280
so really a cratering of the price

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,840
so why are the prices dropping this

114
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,160
quickly this rapidly to launch a ddos

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,320
well it's really again because the

116
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,360
massive growth in iot botnets consumer

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,199
devices all now gigi 5g connected

118
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,280
and you can see this again please don't

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
go and buy bitcoin attacks not condoning

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,639
anything

121
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,320
but if you did go to any of these

122
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,680
websites whether it be cyber vm stressor

123
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
ai nightmare stressor hundreds of others

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,520
with similar names

125
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,039
you'll see the prices for yourself

126
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,199
really really competitive pricing that's

127
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,600
been dropping rapidly over the last

128
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,800
three years

129
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,080
as iot botnets and high-speed consumer

130
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
and enterprise devices have grown

131
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,560
the only thing that's not really going

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,840
down or the only thing that's going up

133
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,160
is a price you are paying for ddos

134
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,600
protection

135
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
now having been a ddos vendor and

136
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,919
architect of several ddos solutions at

137
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,520
multiple companies

138
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,400
i have to tell you it's a great business

139
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
it's good to be a vendor selling

140
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
anti-ddos

141
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,560
as ddos has gone up uh you know the

142
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,639
revenue and the overall market going up

143
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,400
fairly quickly

144
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,639
uh in fact it's going up you know while

145
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,639
you know prices are going down the

146
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,800
overall aggregate's been going up

147
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,520
because the rate of growth of ddos in

148
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,639
iot

149
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,120
is exceeding nearly all other forms of

150
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,440
internet traffic at least at the peak

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,000
so before we actually dive into botnet

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,240
specifically just want to set the stage

153
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,560
of what's happening in the market

154
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,639
again when i started

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,039
ddos was mostly dominated by

156
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,280
amplification and flooding

157
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,000
these are typically people about from 50

158
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
to 100 hosting centers

159
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,759
hosting centers that either indirectly

160
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,400
or actually directly advertise that they

161
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
allow iphm

162
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,440
uh which is internet header modification

163
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,520
ip header modification

164
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,440
so some of these companies inadvertently

165
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
do it and others it's part of their

166
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,319
business plan

167
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,319
but there's about 50 to 100 companies

168
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,960
many in eastern europe and some other

169
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,479
places in asia

170
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,600
that for years have allowed customers

171
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,440
to run commercial services where they

172
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,360
spoof traffic

173
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
now it turns out there's only a limited

174
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,039
number of applications where spoofing

175
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,360
traffic is really useful

176
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,080
botnets and excuse me ddos is one of

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,639
them where you can send a fake source ip

178
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,680
of your victim to any destination

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
typically an amplifier misconfigure dns

180
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,440
something that supports dns sec response

181
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,599
any and it would respond

182
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,800
so for 20 years most ddos was spoofed

183
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,120
traffic out of these hosting centers

184
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,840
either directly spoofed like sin and

185
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,400
reset floods or act floods

186
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,000
or cldap dns memcache

187
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
what's really changed and i'll talk

188
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,720
about over the next several slides

189
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,280
is that really in the last year

190
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,599
the market has flipped

191
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,759
it is no longer the case that ddos is

192
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,800
dominated by spoofed or amplifier

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
in 2022

194
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
most ddos is from compromise iot

195
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,680
and even a few of the cloud providers

196
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,879
have a fairly significant botnet problem

197
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,039
so again 20 years

198
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,840
ddos market was fairly you know

199
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,360
traditional it was the same sorts of

200
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,599
attacks

201
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:00,160
2022

202
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,680
the market has changed

203
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,599
and this is actually about from a year

204
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,800
ago

205
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,960
so going back about a year i think it

206
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
was in june uh june announced where i

207
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,560
presented

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,800
it's really was about 50 hosting

209
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,120
companies 50 asn

210
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
were responsible for 75 80 maybe 90 of

211
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,199
the world's ddos

212
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,120
this is actually showing by various

213
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,800
hosting provider

214
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,360
looking at spoofed traffic that seeing

215
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,759
traffic come out of these providers

216
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,760
for address space they didn't control

217
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,080
and they're not transit providers

218
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,479
going typically to amplifiers or

219
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,599
directly attacking other

220
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,519
other sites on the internet

221
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,720
so this is what it looked like in

222
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,880
2021 about a year ago

223
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,560
and then

224
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,800
it went away

225
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
at some point following june 2021

226
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,040
a third of the

227
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,480
largest

228
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
spoofed hosting providers

229
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,279
stopped sending spoof traffic

230
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,560
really remarkable shift

231
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,399
and you know i think this is probably

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,360
for several reasons but certainly it is

233
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,680
through i think much more muscular

234
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,000
action on many of you in this room with

235
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,640
some of your customers and peers

236
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
looking for obviously spoof traffic

237
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,279
implementing bc38

238
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,839
similar action within ripe so really an

239
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,399
amazing shift in really good news again

240
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,240
this is traffic that's really easy to

241
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,279
spot

242
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,000
right your single home hosting provider

243
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
is not providing transit to microsoft

244
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,560
really you know you can it's this stuff

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,240
is not subtle

246
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,399
they're not providing trends to 18 t and

247
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,519
comcast and china unicom so it's it's if

248
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,279
you go looking for it it's relatively

249
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,680
easy to spot it from your customers

250
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,600
and many of you did

251
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,839
and the traffic stopped

252
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,600
the less good news though is it came

253
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,480
back at least some of it came back

254
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,480
this is looking at one asn

255
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
a non-mize to protect the guilty or the

256
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
innocent

257
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,320
and you know sometime in march

258
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,519
this asn began sending traffic that

259
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,560
claimed it was from china telecom amazon

260
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,800
ovh roblox

261
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
pretty sure they weren't providing

262
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,079
transit to any of those

263
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,160
but we did see a return of spoofed

264
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
traffic

265
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,399
so please if you're not already please

266
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,640
check your customers please make sure in

267
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
terms of your agreements that this is

268
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,160
part of your agreements this should be

269
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,720
low-hanging fruit for us to stop as a

270
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,760
community

271
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,600
obviously spoofed iphm traffic

272
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
i do want to say however i don't want to

273
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
take away from the good news

274
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,320
we are still down by at least a third

275
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,240
from where we were a year ago with

276
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,920
respect to spoofed amplified attacks so

277
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,600
it's still good news

278
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,240
but we still have work to do

279
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,160
the less good news

280
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
is ddos hasn't declined

281
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,519
and ddos overall hasn't declined

282
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,079
because the drop in spoofed and

283
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,360
amplified

284
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
has been taken up

285
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,680
by botnets

286
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,440
and these botnets as you can see i'm

287
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,480
showing the old favorites dns and cldap

288
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,279
these have remained flat or declining

289
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,560
but botnet ddos is on a tear

290
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,920
and growing very very rapidly compared

291
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,360
to typical iphm i.e someone having a

292
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,839
spoofed hosting center

293
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,880
in fact botnet ddos is now the dominant

294
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
form in north america in europe

295
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,839
of ddos attack traffic

296
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,760
eclipsing cldap dns

297
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,600
ctcp reset and others

298
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,480
and the good or bad news depending on

299
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,160
how you view things

300
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,680
is for most of my 20-year career

301
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,360
north america was a net consumer of ddos

302
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,000
i.e the victim of ddos

303
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
for better for worse

304
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,240
as of 2022

305
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,040
north america congratulations is now a

306
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,839
net producer of ddos to the rest of the

307
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,160
world

308
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,320
and the reason it's a net producer is

309
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,639
because there are so many dvr

310
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,360
compromised cp devices

311
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,440
and they're growing day by day by day

312
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
most of the botnet problem is due to

313
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,959
dvrs and webcam and compromised cpe

314
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,800
on occasion you know we do see

315
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,880
compromise more exotic compromised

316
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,240
devices

317
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
for example i'm pretty sure one

318
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,560
manufacturer of parking meters

319
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,839
in

320
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,240
korea has all of their parking meters in

321
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
country compromised

322
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,120
uh doing uh they're doing parking meter

323
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,040
stuff i don't know why you need a wi-fi

324
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,959
enabled parking meter per se but the

325
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,959
rest of the day they're attacking the us

326
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:01,680
but

327
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,079
you know in the u.s it's mostly dvr

328
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,279
webcam

329
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,600
uh compromise cp device and we do have

330
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
at least two cloud providers uh two of

331
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
the large ones have a really serious

332
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,639
botnet problem as well

333
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,040
so just to drill into specifics this is

334
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,600
what a typical attack looks like from

335
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,839
north american residential network about

336
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,279
two terra

337
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,720
5 000 gig connected iot devices

338
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
attacking a single gaming provider in

339
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,800
europe

340
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,639
again wasn't a wasn't a long-lived

341
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,560
attack many of these aren't long-lived

342
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,880
but was a pretty significant attack of

343
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,480
botnet udp game traffic

344
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,399
and if you look at the source ips

345
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:43,680
attacking

346
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,839
you know it's all the same stuff orange

347
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,519
means we've identified the type of

348
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,639
device

349
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,160
we often will know the version of webcam

350
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,040
we'll often also know the cve

351
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,880
and i won't go into it i talked a little

352
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,800
bit about it a year ago but we do a

353
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,120
whole bunch of crawling and other stuff

354
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,000
to try to identify every iot device on

355
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,120
the internet

356
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,959
the red means we've seen it multiple

357
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,000
times in the last three four days

358
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,920
in active ddos attacks so just hundreds

359
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,760
and thousands and hundreds of thousands

360
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,279
of these ips

361
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,079
mostly your customers attacking the rest

362
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,079
of the world

363
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,480
and just for example this is sometimes

364
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,000
it's hard for us to actually know why

365
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,519
something was compromised because there

366
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,079
are multiple compromised devices behind

367
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,320
the gnat or that are exposed so it's

368
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,560
sometimes hard to choose this is one

369
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
that we think was uh you know given cp

370
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
router compromise part of mostly i like

371
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,399
the image i love security you get to

372
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,199
have these great cyclops blink

373
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,040
you know images

374
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,720
but just an example of one of the ips

375
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,760
and if you look at any one of these ips

376
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,560
what you quickly see is that this isn't

377
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,560
just something that is

378
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,639
sort of amateur

379
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,839
your customers have been commercialized

380
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,079
you have been commercialized in a botnet

381
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,079
and kind of like planes if a plane's not

382
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,920
flying it's not making money

383
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,040
these ips are being used every day

384
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,360
sometimes multiple times a day

385
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,680
in just continuous streams where someone

386
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,720
is making money selling you know

387
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,600
ddos attacks leveraging your customers

388
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,839
and you'll see i anonymize some of the

389
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,959
victims

390
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,199
but you know in a space of several days

391
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,519
just looking at a sampling attack

392
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,079
it's russia it's all you know it's part

393
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,040
of international attacks it's part of

394
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,800
a whole bunch of different campaigns

395
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
so what's the problem

396
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,000
the problem is

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,079
iot botnets have been something we've

398
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,000
been talking about for years

399
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,399
they're the scary tales vendors love to

400
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,360
tell at night you know their bot nets

401
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,199
their compromised refrigerators were

402
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,519
always the fear and certainly doubt that

403
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,120
were always coming

404
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,160
beware buy more vendor kit

405
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,880
the only difference is after 10 years of

406
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,560
telling this story

407
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,759
it's starting to become true

408
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:13,519
and if you look at some of the graphs of

409
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,600
both our data and others

410
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,519
we may be trending from what had been a

411
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,639
linear growth in botnets to something

412
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,720
super linear i.e geometric or

413
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,800
exponential

414
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,920
as the botnet grows it both amazes but

415
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,160
doesn't surprise me that security is not

416
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,279
improving

417
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,800
and by that i mean in 2022 there are a

418
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
number of vendors that are shipping with

419
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,759
default passwords it's not even a cve or

420
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,759
the cve is they ship with their default

421
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,759
password

422
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,560
and the iot botnets also from a ddos

423
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,000
perspective are a little more

424
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,079
challenging to mitigate in the sense

425
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
that they don't use synthetic payloads

426
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,040
they're often tls and the payloads are

427
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,680
valid the tcp flags they're i mean

428
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,120
they're not artificially generated

429
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,519
packet they're real devices with full

430
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,240
linux stacks generating traffic that can

431
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,400
respond to redirect and all these other

432
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,000
challenges

433
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,079
and you know structurally this is harder

434
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,000
to solve than spoofed

435
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,520
peering traffic

436
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,799
in that having done uh help

437
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,640
desk sort of work with friends and

438
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,880
family i can tell you what it would be

439
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,799
like to have to call a hundred thousand

440
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,160
of your customers

441
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,559
and work walk them through updating the

442
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,960
firmware on their iot devices

443
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,200
you know it's just structurally a really

444
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,080
challenging problem to solve

445
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,520
as i said this is just you know we've

446
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,120
captured uh spent the better part of

447
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,000
last year just capturing terabytes of

448
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,200
pcaps

449
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,880
and if you look at the p caps of this

450
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,440
bot traffic it's pretty good

451
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,919
it has real user agent statistically

452
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,480
distributed the payload is valid the

453
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,440
form

454
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
you know it is not

455
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,240
faked payload it's real traffic from

456
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,919
real linux stacks

457
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,760
so a lot of the typical

458
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
ddos vendor tricks

459
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,559
of redirect or authentication all fail

460
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,600
or dpi and payload fails because they

461
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,039
are real packets with real payload

462
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,720
so what do we do

463
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,640
well you know i do think we have to

464
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
figure out how as a

465
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,720
you know we if this this goes super

466
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,559
linear we're in trouble

467
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,240
we do have to figure out how we

468
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,280
incentivize or as a community try to put

469
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
pressure on vendors we need to do

470
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,280
something structural i'm just not sure

471
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,360
what it is

472
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,200
there are a number of organizations

473
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,919
nokia included that are tracking the

474
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,360
botnets

475
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,440
and so we're doing crawling at a massive

476
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,679
scale we're working with both our

477
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,440
customers and other vendors on threat

478
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,720
sharing

479
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,960
and one of the things we've been doing

480
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,360
is just collecting about 10 000 so far

481
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,720
samples of every known type of botnet

482
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,840
application attack amplification

483
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,559
spoofing

484
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,720
mainly so we can have a yardstick used

485
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,280
by our internal teams but also by an

486
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,600
industry again trying to see if we can

487
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,840
get through corporate legal but trying

488
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,919
to make some of this data available so

489
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,720
that others can make use of it

490
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,600
and also as a vendor i think it's pretty

491
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,200
clear that if the cost of launching ddos

492
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,799
is doing this

493
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,919
then we also need to attack the economic

494
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,120
problem

495
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080
that is you know ddos pricing and

496
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,760
anti-ddos pricing for csp isps can't be

497
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
doing this

498
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,360
so we've also been looking pretty hard

499
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,400
at how you can use flowspec how you can

500
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,679
use netconf and uh in a lot of ways

501
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,600
address many of the issues that jeff

502
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,080
raised that the hard part about flowspec

503
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,240
is not

504
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,080
generating a filter

505
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
but the hard part is knowing what

506
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,679
filters not to generate

507
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,480
because

508
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,799
you have to know of the idiosyncrasies

509
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,360
of every router vendor of

510
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,039
every version and by the way there's

511
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,120
many

512
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,880
so it's actually a challenge of how do

513
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,799
you actually take all this data and can

514
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,960
you actually compile it down

515
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,480
in

516
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
actually into filters using flowspec or

517
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,240
netconf

518
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
and by the way if you thought flowspec

519
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,520
was cool in terms of what you could

520
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,799
install netconf is is even cooler though

521
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,120
i will say net conf does address some of

522
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,960
the issues jeff had where you can do

523
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,960
much more granular control on where

524
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,200
things get installed

525
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
so we've spent the better part of the

526
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
last year two years collecting basically

527
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,039
every ddos

528
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,200
we've had accounts on every commercial

529
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,159
booter

530
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,640
or every commercial booter that you know

531
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,480
has stayed around long enough for us to

532
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,600
collect from

533
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,840
and we've gathered sample after sample

534
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,559
of

535
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,919
you know many of these by the way the

536
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,200
same attack

537
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,799
right it's often hard to know from the

538
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,520
booter websites when something is tcp

539
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,000
doom like what is that

540
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
but you know in general there's only so

541
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,480
many variants of ddos so many types of

542
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,120
spoofed traffic so many types of botnets

543
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,720
summon the application

544
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,159
and as i said we've kind of been trying

545
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,919
to collect all of them both from the

546
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,039
booters as well as samples contributed

547
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,679
sometimes on a daily basis by some of

548
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,120
our customers

549
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,799
so we've accumulated about 10 000

550
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,760
attacks

551
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,840
which we think does a pretty good job of

552
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,480
covering the universe of you know all

553
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,840
known types of ddos

554
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,080
and it turns out you know this isn't

555
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,159
about this talk as much

556
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,640
but it turns out that with

557
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,799
enough sort of controls and language you

558
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,520
can actually treat flowspec and netconf

559
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
as a programming language

560
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,679
and again i think jeff did a nice job of

561
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,520
raising some of the issues

562
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
but when you think about flossback and

563
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,120
netconf you have to think it of it as a

564
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,320
language

565
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,280
and while flowspec is an itf draft you

566
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,880
have to know to what vendor to what os

567
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,039
you know you're actually compiling to

568
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,640
because they're all different they're

569
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,200
all idiosyncratic in their own glorious

570
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,840
ways they all have limitations there's

571
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,440
trade-offs between

572
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,159
forwarding uh speeds and

573
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,480
memory but you know it turns out you can

574
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,720
actually write a compiler for this stuff

575
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,880
that takes into account the knowledge

576
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,720
about the routers that the line card

577
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,480
about limits about an existing

578
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
utilization

579
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,159
and you can compile these all to try to

580
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,200
tackle

581
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,080
not just amplification

582
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,440
but all ddos including application ddos

583
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,679
including botnet ddos and so on

584
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,559
and in fact if you actually compile this

585
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,240
uh this data actually is using netconf

586
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,120
this is you're looking at netconf with a

587
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,080
commercial you know off-the-shelf

588
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,559
uh commercial vendor

589
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,080
where we took all 10 000 attacks

590
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,240
tried to compile netconf filters for all

591
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,520
these 10 000 attacks and see if we could

592
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,559
achieve 100 mitigation with less than

593
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,280
one percent false positive

594
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,640
and for all of these by the way we've

595
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,720
got the peak caps so all these been hand

596
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,880
inspected we actually have determined

597
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,720
what we think is the good and the bad

598
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,520
traffic within the samples

599
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,360
and you'll see for example

600
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,240
that

601
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,400
botnet now dominates

602
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,559
uh certainly in north america and europe

603
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,120
botnet dominates the reason by the way

604
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,120
that the graph is kind of starts off

605
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,080
slow is that a lot of the left is

606
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
application ddos

607
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,840
but this is looking at cumulative

608
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,280
percent of bytes

609
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
by each attack vector

610
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,440
uh botnet being the first and the

611
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,080
largest getting us to 60

612
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,880
the next largest class is udp

613
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,960
amplification again cldap ntp memcache

614
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,320
and so on

615
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,400
um that again also has kind of a flat

616
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,880
tail because there's so many

617
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,039
gamers of one gigabit you know small

618
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,320
attacks

619
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,480
and finally we get into tcp flooding and

620
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,240
other attacks at the right

621
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,720
but what i think is really interesting

622
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,840
is that you can now largely replace

623
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,679
hardware scrubbers

624
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,640
with compiling flowspec and netconf

625
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,400
directly onto

626
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,039
shipping asic from multiple vendors

627
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,120
certainly it works with nokia but works

628
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,760
with several other vendors as well these

629
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,440
are shipping routers

630
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,279
these are shipping routers where you're

631
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,679
either doing it on your pure edge maybe

632
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,919
your customer edge but it's also where

633
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,480
you're replacing hardware scrubbers with

634
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,279
a dedicated router at sort of 10x

635
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,600
improvement on sort of scale and cost

636
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,799
efficiency

637
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:35,679
so

638
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,600
that's the good news

639
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
with that i think i'm just about done i

640
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,559
left about five minutes for questions

641
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,399
and happy to answer if there's any

642
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,159
come on i made outrageous claims there

643
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,400
has to be a question

644
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,279
okay you have to go to the mic though

645
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,400
yes

646
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,120
um when you are making these changes to

647
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,640
the routers via netconf how often are

648
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,440
you

649
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,600
making updates to that

650
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,360
configuration

651
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,520
yeah that's a good question so

652
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,440
the uh the question is how often do you

653
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,919
make updates and you know i think it

654
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:15,279
varies depending on the type of the

655
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,400
attack

656
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,799
so some attacks actually are shifting

657
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:21,440
over time and we'll be making them you

658
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,320
know uh sub-minute or several minutes

659
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,559
other attacks are fairly stationary but

660
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,480
typically we're monitoring again

661
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,600
standard itf stuff uh both samples

662
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,120
packet samples from the router as well

663
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,640
as ipfix

664
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,039
so for many of the attacks uh you know

665
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,120
the short so many attacks are actually

666
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,960
short-lived right they're less than like

667
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,200
four or five like so there's not a lot

668
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,279
of time to make those changes

669
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,039
but generally we like to like

670
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,960
pre-program filters

671
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,039
and then only instantiate the filters

672
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,720
when we actually see attack

673
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,600
so you know it kind of varies happy to

674
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,039
take it offline

675
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,520
yes next question

676
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,760
hello uh my name is andrei sharoche i

677
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,840
represent mcgill university faculty of

678
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,880
law

679
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,320
uh could you please tell me what legal

680
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,600
means

681
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,080
of combating these threats

682
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,279
you can

683
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,720
express as

684
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,679
uh positive actually to and uh uh

685
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,400
do you think only technical issues to

686
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,919
combat these

687
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,559
botnets these ddos attacks

688
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,120
could be useful or legal

689
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,039
uh answer to this issue is also required

690
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,120
thank you very much

691
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,600
yeah so you know part of this has been

692
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
over the last certainly there's been an

693
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,039
uptick in takedown so this stuff is

694
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,159
illegal

695
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,640
depending on the jurisdiction in fact

696
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,960
you know several sites i used to look at

697
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,320
have been seized by the fbi in the u.s

698
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,960
so you know it is illegal uh there is

699
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,200
constant uh lea

700
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,679
uh you know law enforcement action

701
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,840
the challenge is really twofold though

702
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,760
one is you're dealing with interesting

703
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,200
jurisdictions

704
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,120
so a lot of the buddha or um i forget

705
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,679
what the term what they call

706
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,919
where they ignore dcma requests and

707
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:12,799
others

708
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,360
um i forget the term but you know

709
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,640
there's a lot of companies that will

710
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,720
advertise they'll host all sorts of

711
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,039
copyright content and others generally

712
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,159
they're in

713
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,960
what we call grade jurisdictions which

714
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,720
aren't super enthusiastic about

715
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,559
responding to u.s law enforcement

716
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,760
requests

717
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,240
the other big problem we have is

718
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,039
there is so much money in this

719
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,279
right i mean it's

720
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,240
so it's there's so much incentive

721
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,480
uh to do this and again we've really

722
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,399
seen an uptick fueled with the uptick in

723
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,399
sort of the bitcoin economy

724
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,159
because years ago it's hard to actually

725
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
get a ransom you know extortion demand

726
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,159
like what you have to get gift cards you

727
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:53,679
have to someone drop it in the flower

728
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:54,559
pot

729
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:57,039
you know again pseudo anonymous bitcoin

730
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,000
is has really enabled that

731
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,080
next question yeah one quick question on

732
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,600
your last slide

733
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,279
you were talking about the goal is to

734
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,559
reach 100 mitigation with less than one

735
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,120
percent false positive thing is we've

736
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,200
all seen on networks it doesn't take

737
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,360
very much packet loss

738
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,080
in any given flow to cause disruption to

739
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,200
actual

740
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
transactions user communications

741
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
what effect

742
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,440
does that have on the legitimate traffic

743
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,159
i mean it looks low on the slide but if

744
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,799
we saw one percent say on core networks

745
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:31,600
that

746
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
i would think that would wreak havoc

747
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,600
yeah no it's a good question so just to

748
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,640
step back

749
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,440
it turns out no mitigations are perfect

750
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,960
and again i say this having been the

751
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,720
chief architect for one of the leading

752
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,000
ddos vendors for you know 10 15 years

753
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,399
so uh no one likes to publish the false

754
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,399
positives and in the industry

755
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,720
uh you know doesn't typically force

756
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,640
vendors to talk about that

757
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,200
but it's really easy to block ddos right

758
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,760
just black hole the customer right call

759
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,320
it a day works great

760
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,399
so on one extreme you can just black

761
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,760
call the customer

762
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,679
uh the trouble is

763
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,600
some paying customers don't share your

764
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,960
enthusiasm for being blackholed

765
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,760
and then it really is an issue as we

766
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,080
think about it as

767
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,760
uh you know when we start to look at

768
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
where the traffic is coming from

769
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,520
so for example what conference do we

770
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,279
have these 10 000 ips are all

771
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:28,720
bots

772
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,080
well we can have actually pretty good

773
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,240
confidence that these 10 000 ips are all

774
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,559
bots but we may have an issue with the

775
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,640
filter limit on the router

776
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,559
though we may know exactly what's a

777
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,360
botnet and what's not do we actually

778
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,840
have the filter capacity in doing the

779
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
latency to install those

780
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,600
so you start to get into some really

781
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,679
interesting i think engineering design

782
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,520
trade-offs

783
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,399
again milo medine used to come at home

784
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,559
always had a setting i loved with enough

785
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,200
thrust anything will fly he used to say

786
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,480
at nasa

787
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
and it's true a lot of networking right

788
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,000
i'm pretty sure with enough filters and

789
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,279
enough stuff we can we can block it

790
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,279
the challenge is a more of a constraint

791
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,520
satisfaction problem when you take

792
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,120
realistic constraints on filter size

793
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,360
latency heterogeneous network what can

794
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,559
you achieve

795
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,799
typically ddos vendors and again i say

796
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,120
this having been uh one for last 20

797
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,919
years in like across multiple companies

798
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,919
are aiming for you know five percent or

799
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,200
or less

800
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,440
so typically that will provide really

801
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,880
pretty good performance for most

802
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,279
customers and again it's not actually

803
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,159
that the five percent is five percent

804
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,919
the five percent is typically what goes

805
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,919
to a shaper you're just not sure about

806
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,520
that traffic

807
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,600
so the actual performance may actually

808
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,720
be significantly better than that i feel

809
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,480
like i'm getting the weeds but feel free

810
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,720
to uh happy to take this offline or over

811
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,440
email and i've got graphs and equations

812
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,200
and i don't know we're happy to go into

813
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,880
it but i think we're at the end so thank

814
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,430
you thank you

815
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,910
