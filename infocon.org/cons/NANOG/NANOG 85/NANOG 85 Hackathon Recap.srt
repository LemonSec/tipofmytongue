welcome to the conclusion of another

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,440
successful hackathon we are in the final

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,160
moments of the nanog 85 hackathon it's

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,759
been going on for a little under two

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,360
weeks we're going to talk to one of the

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,240
organizers of the event erin erin tell

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680
me about how your experience has been

9
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,519
it's been great especially this is my

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,320
first analog back in person after you

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,599
know the last two years so it's been

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,920
great to see everybody's faces new and

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,280
former are you know previously known um

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,239
and

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,920
i i always look forward to the hackathon

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,760
i participated in many in the past now

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,160
more so on the organization side of it

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,040
um but it really means a lot to nanong's

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
educational mission in terms of trying

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,039
to help people learn something while

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,879
creating something

22
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,280
each time around and

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,840
yeah i just thank you all for coming

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,280
online and

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,800
in person

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,399
so yeah it's been great

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,879
uh what were you most impressed about

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,640
during this process

29
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,799
yeah you know um thankfully time and

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,240
time again people can come into a room

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,720
that you know they've never met anyone

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,040
uh or worked with them and they're able

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,720
to put a team together and create

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,000
something and learn something at the

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,040
same time

36
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
um and you know we're all coming from

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,479
different parts of the world not

38
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,040
necessarily even north america um so

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,960
it's it's amazing to see that happen

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,000
each time

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,799
again and again awesome

42
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,799
uh is there any participants that would

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,479
like to

44
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,439
offer any insight

45
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,280
so what's your name

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,200
um charles rumford

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,960
okay and what what project did you work

48
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,000
on the build-out viewer

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,880
so how was your experience charles

50
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,399
the experience was good

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,320
i really like the

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,399
isolated time and space to be able to

53
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,159
work on projects that i wouldn't

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,000
normally be able to work on outside of

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,159
outside of the workspace for

56
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,000
interrupt-drivenness or things of that

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,960
nature

58
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
what'd you find most challenging

59
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
well i haven't written javascript in a

60
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,119
very long time so

61
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,639
dealing with javascript was probably the

62
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,239
most challenging part of the whole

63
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,560
experience for me this year what'd you

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
find most rewarding

65
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
as always with my development any kind

66
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
of development project that i work on

67
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,120
the

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,040
when things start falling into line and

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
being able to see you know what you had

70
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,879
in your head come up on the screen is

71
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,000
always a

72
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,599
really great feeling

73
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,560
i can imagine uh so what do you think

74
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,640
you would do differently at the future

75
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,760
hackathon

76
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,920
um i think for me personally i would uh

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,560
want to spend a little more time before

78
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
the hackathon thinking about what i

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,720
wanted to work on and

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,280
doing a little more

81
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,040
requirements in software engineering

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
work beforehand so that i could

83
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,920
potentially get more people on board

84
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,200
and not

85
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
be writing everything out of my head

86
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
so that i can

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,840
instead of just making it up as i go

88
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,319
along that's understandable why'd you

89
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,560
choose the topic that you chose i think

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,800
that a lot of the networking space

91
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,440
visualizations are important um i think

92
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,319
they

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,120
there's a lot out there where we just

94
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,319
look at

95
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,640
data on spreadsheets things of that

96
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,640
nature and don't really get a good

97
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,760
visual

98
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,360
of what's going on and i think the

99
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
visual is important for

100
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,239
people who need to know the information

101
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
but don't exist in the space

102
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,560
absolutely so what did you then learn

103
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,120
about your skill set during this process

104
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,480
no more javascript for me

105
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,560
nice well thank you so much for talking

106
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,239
to me charles it

107
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,159
can you give that microphone to another

108
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,159
participant what's your name

109
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,400
my name is jada milligan

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
nice to meet you jada so tell me what

111
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,959
project you worked on the peering vd

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,799
project will be validating location

113
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,840
services and tell me about your

114
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,599
experience definitely learning about um

115
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,439
an application like peering bd and

116
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,799
learning like what they're trying to do

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,280
for the community then also just being

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
able to see the different insights into

119
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
what goes into

120
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,959
building these types of processes and

121
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,599
then also just taking into account like

122
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,560
why certain ideas um won't work or like

123
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
how they'll affect certain things um so

124
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,080
that's one of my main takeaways

125
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,240
what was most challenging for you

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,320
one of the most challenging things was

127
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,520
definitely understanding um the concepts

128
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,479
that i

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,639
learned about like in my freshman year

130
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,600
and just refreshing my mind about um

131
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
what they are now

132
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
what advice would you give to future

133
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
hackathon participants

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
um future advice i would give is

135
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,639
definitely just

136
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,720
come out there's no need to like be

137
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,160
afraid like you don't have any coding

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,280
experience there's always something you

139
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,160
can do

140
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,560
on the user interface side or

141
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
just with features just having your

142
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
input is definitely something that

143
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,479
anyone can use

144
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,160
and why'd you choose the topic that you

145
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,120
chose

146
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,199
um we chose this topic because it was

147
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,240
definitely something we were kind of

148
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,800
familiar with in the terms of

149
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,680
um

150
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,600
forward-facing community like having

151
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,120
databases

152
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,639
accessible to people

153
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,000
so we definitely want to contribute in

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,520
that aspect

155
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,039
and what did you learn about yourself

156
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,960
during this process

157
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,600
something i learned about myself is

158
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,800
that i have good ideas and that

159
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,440
you know um just don't be afraid to put

160
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,960
your ideas out there and like receive

161
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
feedback

162
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,960
great

163
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,280
thank you so much uh my name is jason

lab awesome and jason tell me about your

166
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,479
experience uh i i really enjoyed being

167
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,840
able to kind of speed run through

168
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,800
learning

169
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,520
some aws cli and just new tools like

170
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,280
packer that i had not been exposed

171
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,320
before exposed to before

172
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
it kind of and and really being even

173
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
shown the container lab

174
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
project itself i think i've

175
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,000
heard it mentioned you know in passing

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,919
and you know and some news articles or

177
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,520
something but being exposed to it and

178
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,440
see like there's a lot of value in

179
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,720
in being able to stand up a lab

180
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
environment for

181
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,440
um

182
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,319
you know

183
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,919
just you know hey i want to test out

184
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,520
this new topology or something and i can

185
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,800
i can build a

186
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,919
pretty

187
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,240
a lab that i can test things in pretty

188
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,960
quickly now speaking about the value of

189
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,680
a

190
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
scenario and this which is so hands-on

191
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
but also gives you that ability to

192
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,680
experiment

193
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,560
and test what would you say to future

194
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,880
hackathon participants you know getting

195
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,479
involved in the hackathon is a lot of

196
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,560
fun i i really like

197
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,000
just kind of being able to get in the

198
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
room with other people who are all

199
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,039
like-minded and just want to you know

200
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,560
take a project and you know kick around

201
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,039
some so how can you make it better and

202
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,560
you know improve on what was there

203
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
before

204
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,039
what did you learn about your own skill

205
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,759
set during this process um i am not very

206
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,240
good at git

207
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
how does that contribute to how you

208
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
would do things differently or if not if

209
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,599
so

210
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,759
um i mean i like just i think it's like

211
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,680
a perishable skill to try and you know

212
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,520
use it use it more often

213
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
if you're not uh using it in a

214
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,319
day-to-day run you know or you know

215
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,160
putting code into git or just kind of

216
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,360
running into the problems that everyone

217
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
else does there's a lot of consulting

218
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
doctor google for

219
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,120
um search results

220
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,400
do you think there's

221
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,880
like just as much power in knowing what

222
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,479
you're not good at as knowing what

223
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,039
you're good at uh absolutely i think and

224
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
there's you know and being able to send

225
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,240
like where the weaknesses are and going

226
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
to other other people on the team that

227
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
are a lot more skilled on some of those

228
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,560
i can ask for help and say like oh yeah

229
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,479
i understand that and then

230
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,080
um you know there's other things that i

231
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,319
was able to share that i know help push

232
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,560
push the team forward and get you know

233
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,319
work on the project a little bit more

234
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,080
aaron it looks like we have a full house

235
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,039
though

236
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,520
yeah um so actually that's a great segue

237
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,599
one thing that i was going to say is

238
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,720
we could always use everyone here's help

239
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,160
for recruiting more people for the next

240
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,520
