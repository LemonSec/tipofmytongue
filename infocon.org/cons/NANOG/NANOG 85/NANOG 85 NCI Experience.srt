[Music]

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,439
it's a very welcoming experience just

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,640
being able to see

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,880
different people seeing women of color

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,800
here and just being able to talk to

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,160
different people having people come up

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,760
to me and be extremely interested in

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,320
what i am doing and then where i came

11
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,800
from met howard and then also like

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,719
saying hey we have job opportunities for

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,879
you quite a few of the conferences is

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,440
just like a large like

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,920
for respectfully dog and pony show where

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,800
there's a lot of sales and a lot of

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
marketing and here the environment was

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,520
really around collaboration and i saw

19
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,600
that right away so that was a huge

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
surprise for me not necessarily the

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,440
talks were the most important for me but

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
it was really the networking so i

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,440
consider myself introverted in nature

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,080
and i find it hard sometimes to uh speak

25
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,840
for myself or kind of connect with

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,760
people and people are really forward

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,119
like they'll approach you and you know

28
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,479
ask hey you know

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,840
where's howard university like what do

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,759
you do what's your background sort of

31
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,680
forcing me to get out of that my comfort

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,520
zone of kind of sitting down and just

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,880
observing i had a warm feeling that i'm

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,799
glad my students had the opportunity to

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,799
experience this focus probably their

36
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,640
first you know real

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,960
industry conference so like as a black

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,320
woman sometimes i feel like when i'm in

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,000
professional settings i have to

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,720
represent or put on and make a good

41
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,400
impression but it didn't really feel

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
like that here everyone kind of is

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,280
themselves they're coming as they are

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,799
they're speaking to you like you know

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,720
we're just two people that just happen

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
to be in a similar industry i'd say

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,600
definitely take the opportunity because

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,439
first off not only did we travel

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,759
internationally to montreal but you get

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,680
you get to explore like so many

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
different ideas and innovations that are

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,079
happening within technology because

53
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,759
technology is ever-changing it's

54
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,439
constantly growing it's constantly

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,119
something that we should stay informed

56
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,000
about i would definitely like to attend

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,318
another conference like this um and i

58
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,160
would hope that you know having power

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440
university come out so this one

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,360
specifically that it would open the door

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
to bring even more hbcus or even more

62
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,280
hour students to attend i think it's

63
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,360
really good especially like as an

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,720
underclass and still pursuing your

65
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,879
undergraduate experience to have these

66
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,400
additional professional development

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,920
experiences that are not just

68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,160
internships or externships outside of

69
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,599
the classroom because in the real world

70
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,120
you won't necessarily have a professor

71
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
to tell you where to go or who to talk

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
to or how to speak to so you need to

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
kind of kind of the growing pains you

74
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,879
might have a few embarrassing awkward

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,560
moments where you might not know what to

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
say and you might feel like oh i

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,000
embarrass myself or but it's really

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
important to you know as young black

79
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,360
individuals you have the opportunity to

80
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,040
sort of seize the day we should take it

81
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
and go full on and you know take what we

82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
can out of it and then hopefully

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,920
continue to open those doors for the

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,680
next generations to come along and do

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,640
the same

86
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:12,879
[Music]

87
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,959
you
