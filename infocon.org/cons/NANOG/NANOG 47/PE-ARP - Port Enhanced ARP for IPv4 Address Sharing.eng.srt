1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,790
let's talk of this session<font color="#CCCCCC"> Manish career</font>

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:11,400
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt from our Sponsors is going</font>

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,469
to be talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us about a concept for</font>

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,410
using art for ipv4 address sharing page

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:21,510
hi I<font color="#CCCCCC"> manage from the merit I work in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,269
research group there and what we've been

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on for the past you know eight</font>

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,619
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months or so is is kind of an</font>

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,949
interesting but really weird idea of

10
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:36,180
trying to see whether we can what more

11
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:39,590
use we can put arp to and in particular

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we're trying to do is address this</font>

13
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,489
notion of what is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> an endpoint</font>

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,700
identifier is at an IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> or is it</font>

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:48,828
a mac address so very<font color="#CCCCCC"> quickly here is</font>

16
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,879
roughly what I'll be talking about

17
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:54,059
describe a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better what our</font>

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,680
motivations for this project was what

19
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:58,260
were the key insights that we thought we

20
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,640
could leverage our implementation status

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:04,259
and some future work so roughly what we

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,350
were motivated by was trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,380
out what what else can we do to to

24
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,360
address the scarcity the looming

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,658
scarcity of ipv4 addresses that's going

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,759
to going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen ipv6 adoption is is</font>

27
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,110
ramping up very rapidly I mean the more

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,369
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look on the nanog list the more you</font>

29
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,539
start to actually become a believer

30
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,270
these days we're we're but for more ipv4

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,030
perspective we're still evolving from an

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:33,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">air of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty to an error of scarcity</font>

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,670
and in how do we adapt to do this change

34
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,820
what kind of mindset do we need to

35
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">change over the next couple of years try</font>

36
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,559
to see what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with the can we</font>

37
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,329
squeeze more use out of less and and

38
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,140
it's and you know scarcity<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

39
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:51,059
always a good time to think about some

40
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,380
long-standing assumptions and how how

41
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:53,820
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> change some of those assumptions</font>

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,929
and what breaks and what doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

43
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,898
and so the underlying all this is has

44
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,930
led to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the concept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of port</font>

45
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,299
scavenging and and this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

46
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,399
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is evolving it not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just us</font>

47
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,750
but other people are also looking

48
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,470
into what they can extract more use out

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,030
of by scavenging port space so here's

50
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,180
the key observations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

51
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:25,319
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at so there's a range of valid</font>

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,840
source ports every end<font color="#E5E5E5"> host has 65,000</font>

53
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">fort source ports available but they're</font>

54
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,670
largely unused newer applications are

55
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,950
coming out things like itunes and google

56
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,958
maps for example will will make of the

57
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,909
orders of hundreds of connection

58
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,010
simultaneously but for the most part

59
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,510
most applications most common usage

60
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,250
scenarios if you look at traffic going

61
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,858
across our network and see how many

62
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:48,659
source<font color="#CCCCCC"> ports on average get used by a</font>

63
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:51,319
single IP address we see the number to

64
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:55,730
be small the order of 5 to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 / a</font>

65
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:58,409
30-second window the second insight is

66
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,510
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually every every node these</font>

67
00:02:58,409 --> 00:03:02,400
days in the current networking stack has

68
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,000
two unique identifiers he gets a mac

69
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,370
address and he has an IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and the</font>

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,470
question is is there there's the

71
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is can we change that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can we</font>

72
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">get away just by using the mac address</font>

73
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:18,919
as the unique identifier and sharing the

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,198
IP address among multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> end nodes and</font>

75
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,930
finally there's there's notion that it's

76
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,659
not really an end note that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

77
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,190
unique IP address port combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

78
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:31,698
actually the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the service</font>

79
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:36,959
that's running<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the on the end toast</font>

80
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:39,239
so perhaps it might be possible to to

81
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,519
essentially hand out a single IP address

82
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,040
to multiple hosts as long as you limit

83
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,870
the port ranges that they get assigned

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,959
so here's the architecture of for test

85
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network what we're looking at is the the</font>

86
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,400
test network is in the orange box<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

87
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,440
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> four key components that we</font>

88
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,500
identified that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to change or we</font>

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to think about very carefully one</font>

90
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,790
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> host themselves what needs to</font>

91
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:04,949
change their to the end the local

92
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:06,090
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> what can we change on the local</font>

93
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:09,680
network do we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change any</font>

94
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,000
protocols do need a modified<font color="#E5E5E5"> ARP table</font>

95
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,099
essentially to help us locate these

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,840
these new identifier is now that the in

97
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,358
IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no longer unique ident</font>

98
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,738
fire and also do we need support to find

99
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,880
services that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

100
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:26,429
network now so those components are

101
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,690
essentially on the end hosts we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

102
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,760
about essentially port range management

103
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,669
this can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done in a couple of</font>

104
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,190
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways one of them is using dhcp</font>

105
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,020
and leveraging some options in dhcp to

106
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,020
hand out port range information in

107
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,609
addition to IP address information in

108
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">linux you can also do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

109
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,900
can just hard code your source port

110
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,900
range through the proc file system

111
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,770
second component<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the art protocol</font>

112
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,389
this is once again the art protocol

113
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,549
itself when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to implement our</font>

114
00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,010
scheme we realized that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> our protocol</font>

115
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,800
has gone surprisingly untouched in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

116
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:03,150
linux kernel for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past 10 years most</font>

117
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,340
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comments that you see in it are</font>

118
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,380
really old<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it hasn't been updated in</font>

119
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,469
awhile mainly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just works and</font>

120
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,570
nobody ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arp but anyways</font>

121
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:14,460
what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ended up modifying</font>

122
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:16,560
the ARB implementation we modified the

123
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,859
request and there are responses to

124
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,000
include port level information as well

125
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,820
also we had to modify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ARP table</font>

126
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,889
because now in addition to IP address to

127
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,419
mac address mapping we need to have the

128
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,700
portlet information in there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

129
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,930
finally what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we realize when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

130
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to complete the whole</font>

131
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,060
architecture was well now that we we

132
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:39,090
don't have a unique IP address for it or

133
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,400
unique endpoint anymore how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we find</font>

134
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,919
fix port services services like web

135
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,560
servers email servers which all need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

136
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,320
run that we locate these days by their

137
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,340
fixed and well-known ports and and for

138
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:55,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would we would we developed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was the</font>

139
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,888
notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of using DNS as a service locator</font>

140
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,260
in particular there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a concept which</font>

141
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">once again was developed about two</font>

142
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,120
thousand two which was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> notion of SRV</font>

143
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:07,979
records which are not widely used but

144
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,900
which were apparently exactly what we

145
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:14,190
needed they're essentially SRV records

146
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,109
provide you with a way of handing out

147
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:20,789
port information for specific services

148
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:23,250
on on end points so we went ahead coded

149
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,930
this up and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> our test apology</font>

150
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,920
looks like there's three end hosts

151
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:29,110
there's the edge router and then

152
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,620
you know that edge router is essentially

153
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:34,150
hooking up to the bigger outside world

154
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:38,320
we're sharing a single IP address on all

155
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:40,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">three three nodes and we limit what port</font>

156
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,480
ranges are assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each one and with</font>

157
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:45,340
our implementation we were able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

158
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,930
both scenarios working what do I mean

159
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">when I say both scenarios so they're</font>

160
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">just two scenarios you need to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

161
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,830
outbound packet connections work well

162
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,500
and that inbound connections to servers

163
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:59,710
that you're running inside the sheltered

164
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,410
modified network also<font color="#E5E5E5"> work so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll point</font>

165
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,030
out packets is really simple all in and

166
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,500
hosts have to do is pick a source port

167
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,059
from the allowed range it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

168
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,740
the allowed range has shrunk now and

169
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,180
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can just send out packets as</font>

170
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,460
normal there's nothing that really needs

171
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change it's the inbound processing</font>

172
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,419
that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky part</font>

173
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,090
and what you have to do in this case is

174
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,800
on the edge router when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you figure out</font>

175
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,780
who you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send your packets to</font>

176
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,520
you don't just perform an IP address

177
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:28,419
lookup you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform an IP address</font>

178
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the port look up and that's that's</font>

179
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">the change we need to make on the edge</font>

180
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:39,070

main complexity was and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> took us the</font>

186
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,010

<font color="#E5E5E5">everything gets cached in there in the</font>

or DNS modifications to our architecture

190
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,470
yet we have a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good idea of how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

191
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">implement these we just haven't done it</font>

yet and we can we can we our current

<font color="#E5E5E5">scenarios working correctly outbound as</font>

195
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,780
well as inbound so for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

196
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,219
run an ssh server on a different port

197
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:26,229
and connect to it correctly from the

198
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:28,600
outside world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on here's the</font>

201
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:35,110
you type type art- in you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the IP</font>

207
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,650
addresses with different port ranges how

208
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,689
do we deploy this so we've thought about

209
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:54,579
two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which deployment</font>

210
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,920
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done one is and the best scenario</font>

211
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,450
of course is you you modify the art

212
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,370
functionality on the local edge router

213
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:03,160
this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done for</font>

214
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:06,190
sites that want to use this shared IP

215
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:08,860
addressing technique but then you know

216
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to modify art there and</font>

217
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:13,720
know as well as on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host so that they</font>

218
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:16,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">are making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right queries the second</font>

219
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,070
solution is to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bridge where we're</font>

220
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,380
your local router does not support the

221
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:22,060
modified art functionality you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can drop</font>

222
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,689
in a bridge that does support it and

223
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,469
that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide the modified</font>

224
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:31,089
capabilities so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the advantages</font>

225
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:33,730
advantages that are you don't need to

226
00:09:31,089 --> 00:09:35,940
rely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on anybody else to do to get better</font>

227
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">utilization out of your IP address space</font>

228
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:40,480
it's incremental<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployable you can</font>

229
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:44,170
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> one site you can deploy a local</font>

biggest benefits is its end-to-end

232
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,390
consistent so there's no device in the

middle of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network that's modifying</font>

234
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:54,819
your port information like a nap would

235
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,589
and you you are going to break<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-to-one mapping notion between an IP</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">address and a hardware address but</font>

238
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,570
perhaps there you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a bad</font>

239
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:04,150
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps it's time to question</font>

240
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:05,620
whether that whether there was whether

241
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:10,150
the reason for having that one-to-one

242
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:12,010
mapping still is a valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and what</font>

243
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:14,079
you can do once once what you can do

244
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,730
with this sharing notion is that a

245
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:20,130
single IP address can now be shared by

246
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:22,630
thousands of hosts on a network and

247
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,689
since you're no longer hiding behind a

<font color="#E5E5E5">NAT you can also do better / flow end</font>

250
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,470
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can identify in the middle</font>

of the network a specific endpoint

00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:39,370
uniquely because they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> using a</font>

extending the use of ipv4 addresses but

256
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,730
more importantly what's what's really

257
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,870
interesting these days in

258
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:56,029
this happened very recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> in July the</font>

00:10:56,029 --> 00:11:02,060
they've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least three similar or</font>

261
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,649
along the same lines proposals drafts

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been submitted to the ITF and</font>

263
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,690
them and there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> increasing</font>

264
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,579
interest in forming above and working

266
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:20,349
out so there's plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest in</font>

267
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:23,510
this space right now so conclusions did

268
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:26,600
so what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> PE up really break it</font>

269
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:29,269
breaks some things you need to do things

270
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,920
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit differently what are the</font>

271
00:11:29,269 --> 00:11:32,839
benefits well the benefits are obviously

272
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,649
you're you're getting massive reuse of

273
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,839
IP addresses it's an end-to-end reuse

274
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:41,300
unlike in that scenario which is not

275
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:43,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">really an end-to-end reuse of IP</font>
