do that a couple of pieces of

administration first of all if you have

10
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,640
got an idea for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lightning talk for</font>

this remember this is your community and

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,019
and you know what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have what you have</font>

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,989
right direction and then the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

26
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,000
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program committee nominations</font>

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:04,048
closed for that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> evening so again if</font>

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,180
you get you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody that's</font>

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">being on the program committee or you</font>

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,229
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just nominate somebody who you</font>

33
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,080
think will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great addition to the</font>

34
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,310
program committee do that because yeah

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,119
we really do need all the help we can

36
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,409
get in nice as possible way um so other

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,729
than that so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go for</font>

38
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:25,710
lightning talks now we've got three

39
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:31,829
lightning talks I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:33,809
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaker up here and that's under</font>

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:36,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">smack rackin I who is going to talk</font>

42
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,460
about real-time visualization and the

43
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,710
idea with this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it seems to</font>

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,020
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting lots of disparate data</font>

45
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,899
sources together and trying to do decent

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,619
sort of coordinated stuff with it what

47
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:51,479
I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do is get the next talk are</font>

48
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:52,560
ready as well so so they're being moved

49
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,570
because these are supposed to be pretty

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,570
quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tightly time ten minutes each</font>

51
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:07,950
hi my name is Ernst McCracken I'm a PhD

student at the University<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Memphis I'm</font>

53
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,430
neglected to look at the location of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">lightning talks actually thought that</font>

55
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">they put me in a small room with maybe</font>

56
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:18,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">like 10 people to present to so it's a</font>

57
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">little intimidating if I if I mess up</font>

58
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,750
and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> something completely wrong</font>

59
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,810
please don't call me out on it now just

60
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">kidding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just kidding so the work I've</font>

61
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,430
been doing actually started working on

62
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,370
this in my undergrad and it's called

63
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">nephews real-time visualization of</font>

64
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet path dynamics for network</font>

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,430
management and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea the tool was to</font>

66
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:43,739
help both researchers and network

67
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,840
operators visualize routing paths and to

68
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:47,220
help network operators and help

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,160
researchers and developing future

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:55,890
protocols so the the motor for

71
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,000
visualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet topology mapping</font>

72
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,920
and visualization attempts to

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,900
graphically represent internet

74
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,700
architecture and there's several

75
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,280
examples i have here course<font color="#CCCCCC"> kate has</font>

76
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,230
done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work in internet</font>

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,700
visualization there's other tools out

78
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:14,250
there Mercator rocket fuel and why to

79
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,609
visualize internet topology in real time

80
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,900
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our main motivation here so you</font>

81
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,510
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> monitor the reach ability of a</font>

83
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,220
deep<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearings and you also want to</font>

84
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,680
identify route hijacking and

85
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:33,320
misconfigurations quickly so you can

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:39,150
mitigate these effects or take steps to

87
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:41,010
to catch<font color="#E5E5E5"> these effects so we've been</font>

88
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,989
developing the next generation route

89
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,929
monitoring software<font color="#CCCCCC"> high data</font>

90
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,930
completeness in integrity scalability

91
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:53,489
and accessibility we want the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pete</font>

92
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:55,709
to be accessible by everyone so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

93
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:58,799
first component which was actually

94
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:01,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">developed at the Colorado State</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

95
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,970
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp mon and it's a lightweight</font>

96
00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:07,920
btp monitor with over 70 peers and it

97
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,380
gives you this presents this information

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,850
in real time because I other solutions

99
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,799
like

100
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:15,260
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it updates every five or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

101
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">15 minutes and you can download the</font>

102
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,810
updates and they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make our work</font>

103
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:23,780
possible by giving us data in real time

104
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:27,470
and our component of course is called

105
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,929
net views originally it was just a tool

106
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,880
to download the updates and that was it

107
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,290
and then I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like well you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know for</font>

108
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting this information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time why</font>

109
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:38,840
don't we visualized it also and so we

110
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:41,600
took we visualized<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s paths and then</font>

111
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,119
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was it occurred to me well</font>

112
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,550
were able to catch routing updates in

113
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">real time why don't we also tried to</font>

114
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,670
attempt to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the forwarding pass</font>

115
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:56,450
during these routing events so just a

116
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:58,730
quick look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup so here on the</font>

117
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:02,780
left here you have a show my pointer

118
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:05,030
yeah you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mon which connects to</font>

119
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,280
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we connect to BD p.m. on and</font>

120
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:11,119
they send us the routing updates and

121
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,179
from their clients which subscribe to an

122
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,760
overlay Network we afford the updates to

123
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:19,220
them and so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get the BGP updates</font>

124
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:21,890
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time and that's through our data</font>

125
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:25,040
broker and additionally we have a probe

126
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,260
manager that will probe the target

127
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,450
networks to get the forwarding paths

128
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,610
information and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually thought we</font>

129
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:36,050
actually probe the target networks from

130
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:38,080
the BGP peers we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some smaller</font>

131
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,690
components of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Geo coder which basically</font>

132
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,789
gets geographical information from the a

133
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:48,380
s is basically just office information

134
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and an IP crawler which attempts to get</font>

135
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,950
traceable IP addresses so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can have</font>

136
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,820
these ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time when we start our</font>

137
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:59,060
probing and so just an example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

138
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,780
server component interaction so in this

139
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,680
example 14 0 for 1 will has a route

140

149
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,250

150
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:35,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">using a traceroute command this</font>

151
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:36,250
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is then sent back to the</font>

152
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:42,099
client so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have this information</font>

153
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:44,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">available and we probe during you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

154
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:48,878
routing events so what we do is we

155
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:52,210
here's an example timeline of a BGP up

156
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:54,099
data scene and we initiate a probe right

157
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:58,090
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the get-go and periodically we will</font>

158
00:06:54,099 --> 00:07:02,349
probe the same address<font color="#E5E5E5"> until we see no</font>

159
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:04,239
bgp activity so there's a various you

160
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:08,050
can see the btp updates but after a

161
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,210
certain time period we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop we stop the</font>

162
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:15,729
the probing and consider that the event

163
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:18,989
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> completed this is just a couple</font>

164
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:25,090
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshots from a prototype and</font>

165
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:28,180
you see a path to this dash 24 you can

166
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:32,340
do searches and browse a esas and see

167
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:35,650
the prefixes that they are originating

168
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,859
we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> visualization filters you</font>

169
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:42,099
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter based on so here we're</font>

170
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,529
filtering based on the degree basically

171
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:47,409
the number of neighbors that is is

172
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:50,680
connected to and we can see for instance

173
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:56,800
this way the most the AS IS with the

174
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:59,740
highest degree and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a live you</font>

175
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,759
actually neglected to upload the actual

176
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:05,289
video is it okay if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to I'm</font>

177
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,860
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to youtube to show you the</font>

178
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:14,050
the the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself artists should work</font>

179
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:16,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok cool she had done this before hand</font>

180
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,259
actually

181
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,318
let's turn that off add some some nice

182
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:43,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool music there and maybe you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font>

183
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:48,399
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us break that one thousand mark</font>

184
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:52,600
here yeah yeah everybody do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all once</font>

185
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:54,639
so just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so this is a couple</font>

186
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,639
of updates and the updates pop up real

187
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,709
time and they show it<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll be</font>

188
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:01,989
displayed here on the map and the

189
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:04,540
locations of the autonomous systems are

190
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:08,110
based on coordinates<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've obtained</font>

191
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:09,790
through the routing registries and like

192
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:12,660
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a prototype</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

193
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:17,738
interface and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac of changed since then</font>

194
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:20,920
and the blue paths basically our<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

195
00:09:17,739 --> 00:09:27,329
additions or changes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> red pass</font>

196
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:34,118
indicate withdrawals and we pause this

197
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:36,910
go back to here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can also</font>

198
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:38,980
visualize the forwarding paths it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

199
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:41,999
of a naive approach like I saw service

200
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:44,769
in my undergrad and there's of course

201
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:50,889
issues with inferring topology from

202
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:52,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">tracer outs so in conclusion the</font>

203
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:53,949
features we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a real-time</font>

204
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:57,699
visualization of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control plane and</font>

205
00:09:53,949 --> 00:10:00,969
we can also get the status of forwarding

206
00:09:57,699 --> 00:10:02,519
paths during route change events and so

207
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's where our work stands right now</font>

208
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,720
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future we want to correlate</font>

209
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:10,299
forwarding and routing dynamics in order

210
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,009
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a classification model for</font>

211
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:15,759
network operators and researchers so

212
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:19,199
they can see classify different types of

213
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:22,749
routing events whether you're in a loop

214
00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:25,329
routing loops etc we also want to add

215
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:27,040
scalability because<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we're</font>

216
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:30,160
connecting to looking glass servers

217
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,368
which if we have a thousand clients on

218
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,259
at a time that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

219
00:10:33,369 --> 00:10:37,629
servers so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add some</font>

220
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:41,379
scalability by having clients be able to

221
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:44,230
run trace routes from each other and

222
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:47,120
appear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer fashion and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

223
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,400
help get more vantage points back

224
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,690
the same target Network and we also i

225
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,189
give client users the ability to

226
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,620
communicate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other using the</font>

227
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,110
tools so that you can communicate with

228
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:00,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">others and talk about certain events</font>

229
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:02,480
that are occurring and that is about it

230
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:03,319
for me oh also acknowledgments were

231
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">funded by the National Science</font>

232
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:11,420
Foundation and our collaborators are we

233
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,070
have collaborators at UCLA Colorado

234
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,900
State University and the University of

235
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:23,900
Oregon and if anybody has<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions</font>

236
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:25,730
oh well we're getting questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> could I</font>

237
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">get Jim Kelly from menaces appear the</font>

238
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:31,160
next speaker so that he can get ready to

239
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,450
did his tool hey I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> mr. getting</font>

240
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">retards trying to figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if he could</font>

241
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube but uh that's very cool i was</font>

242
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering what it would require to run</font>

243
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,570
it on to you know what infrastructure

244
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,350
you need to run this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool Oh actually</font>

245
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:49,190
it's it's I implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> all in Java so</font>

246
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:52,640
we run the server portal honor on in our

247
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,529
lab and clients I mean as long as you

248
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,089
have Java on your computer you can run

249
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:58,430
the client it's basically just a swing

250
00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:00,830
swing framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we could like</font>

251
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,400
putting put a pointer up to it on refuse

252
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:06,860
or something like that yeah yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

253
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,779
I'll uh I don't have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website here</font>

254
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,120
but get with me afterwards and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can i</font>

255
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">can give you a you know information on</font>

256
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,130
looking at our research and if any

257
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:18,110
companies have summer internships I'm

258
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,150
kind of a young I'm in the academic

259
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,700
setting but I'm have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font>

260
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:25,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">had much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience in operations and in</font>

261
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,920
the field so many companies have summer

262
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:31,010
internships just let me know I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

263
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,079
plug myself there you know thank you

264
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks very much ten minutes</font>

265
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,470
perfect

266
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:46,199
which one's mine oh that's embarrassing

267
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:50,429
mine says company name here how did it

268
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:56,519
you that yes here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go all right I'm</font>

269
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:57,718
Jim Kelly for menaces sometimes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

270
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,879
you come up with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a talk</font>

271
00:12:57,719 --> 00:13:02,309
and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the data and the data gods</font>

272
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:05,069
give you material for<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 minute talk and</font>

273
00:13:02,309 --> 00:13:06,539
sometimes the data gods don't smile on

274
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:07,709
you and they give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you material for a 10</font>

275
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:09,169
minute talk and then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

276
00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:11,248
fair to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make people listen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

277
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:16,978
30-minute presentation of a 10 minute

278
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:18,419
talk so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the latter title here is</font>

279
00:13:16,979 --> 00:13:20,189
the recession the routing table reading

280
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:22,739
the tea leaves so what Renesys does you

281
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:24,779
probably know we we appear with there

282
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:25,889
are no 300-plus people try to get the

283
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,379
picture of the routing table as its

284
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:31,219
evolving and periodically we dig<font color="#CCCCCC"> into it</font>

285
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:33,989
and come up with some nuggets of wisdom

286
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:35,579
this is one such case he was what I

287
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:38,579
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know here is the great idea I</font>

288
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:40,439
said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are tough times we</font>

289
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:42,149
know that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet responds in terms</font>

290
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:44,579
of the total transit marketplace to

291
00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:46,079
economic conditions because we saw we

292
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,079
all got a bit of a break that have a

293
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,439
breather from v4 exhaustion immediately

294
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">following the dot-com crash in 2000-2001</font>

295
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:59,098
so I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there's a recession on</font>

296
00:13:55,799 --> 00:14:00,929
now surely we should be able to see some

297
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:03,899
signs of people retrenching in the

298
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:05,279
global and regional routing tables it

299
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,229
makes sense right it's tempting

300
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,539
enterprises are smart they're rational

301
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:11,639
economic players you might want to scale

302
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,429
back provider diversity choose a cheap

303
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:16,949
provider maybe even leave the internet

304
00:14:13,429 --> 00:14:19,289
so as contracts are expiring or

305
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:20,878
companies are going bankrupt like hedge

306
00:14:19,289 --> 00:14:23,939
funds<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be able to see the signs</font>

307
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:29,039
in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table nice idea for a</font>

308
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:30,659
talk so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we in fact well so here's the</font>

309
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,709
curve I expected to see here's three

310
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:36,829
years of the S&P<font color="#E5E5E5"> 500 going down let's</font>

come back probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> read about this</font>

312
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:40,559
there's another curve that looks like

00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that here's the Baltic Dry Index which</font>

00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:43,920
is a cool

<font color="#CCCCCC">decks that measures the cost of renting</font>

00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:53,120
oceans physically went right in the

basement ninety<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent collapse so</font>

319

three years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> North American routing I</font>

320
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:01,800
say it's got to go oh I'm sorry I have

321
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:03,630
it upside down it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

322
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:06,900
of course because routing didn't slow

323
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,300
down doesn't follow normal economics it

324
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,779
just kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> going up the amazing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

325

the consistency of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rise too much</font>

326
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:16,950
game you know it goes up this is the

<font color="#CCCCCC">North American curve but you can look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

328
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,089
the planetary curve and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks very</font>

329
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to this it goes up multiple</font>

00:15:21,089 --> 00:15:25,080
percent per year come hell or high water

331
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:28,589
there's no depression visible great

332
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:32,310
there goes my talk so you know why does

333
00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:33,990
the table keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> growing well enterprises</font>

334
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,089
don't really cut costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> by leaving the</font>

335
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,700
internet now they may cut costs by

336
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,320
reducing diversity or by putting off

337
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,580
their plans to acquire more provider

338
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:50,070
diversity in an economic analogy cheap

339
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:53,010
transit and cheap address space is kind

340
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,660
of like easy money you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just expect that</font>

341
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:56,310
with that kind of stimulus out there

342
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:58,560
with transit prices falling to single

343
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,270
dollars per meg you're going to get

344
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,459
inflation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the table and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it continues</font>

345
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,650
there's also the possibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as be</font>

346
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:07,020
four starts to run out people may be

347
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:08,939
wanting to put their assets in the table

348
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show everybody that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

349
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,660
great use of them so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a quick</font>

350
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:19,200
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at the first of October</font>

351
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">October 0 60 70 80 90 outing table goes</font>

352
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,089
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I broken it out here by how many</font>

353
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:25,979
providers each one of these prefixes had

354
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:28,350
and you can see from these rough numbers

355
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,850
that little hair more than half the

356
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:32,160
table is actually just hanging out there

357
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:35,779
with a single provider which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess is</font>

358
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,779
good news for the v6 transition

359
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:41,100
twenty-nine percent of two and it goes

360
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,600
down from there one of the interesting

361
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">things overall is that you see that the</font>

362
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,430
number of prefixes that carry four or

363
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,200
more providers is going up that's about

364
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,839
the only healthy part that's that's

365
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,790
really got a substantial growth rate

366
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:55,850
so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at each category</font>

367
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:58,339
just real quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what here you see a</font>

368
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:03,050
chart of the just the subset of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

369
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:04,670
in table who have one provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

370
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,250
what this says is that from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 6 207</font>

371
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,380
sixty-eight percent of those still have

372
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,150
one provider and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next year sixty-six</font>

373
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:15,440
percent of those still had one provider

374
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,910
sort of a recurrence some double-digit

375
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,650
percentage of them sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vanishing to</font>

376
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,600
know where usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are big</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">year later because they got reaggravated</font>

379
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:27,020
good job and some small percentage of

380
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:29,419
these guys go to two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three providers</font>

381
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,270
or four but you know it's not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

382
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,880
if you look as things go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 7 to 8</font>

383
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:39,110
09 there are fewer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and fewer people</font>

384
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,000
choosing to upgrade similarly if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

385
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,409
have two providers there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> fewer</font>

386
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,250
of them actually going out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy the</font>

387
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,420
third provider as the recession picks in

388
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,250
the rate of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> going from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two to</font>

389
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,550
three goes from eleven percent to 11 to

390
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,830
eight percent then we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from two</font>

391
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:57,440
providers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> four plus goes from 4.3</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

393
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,910
align right these are people i claim who

394
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,000
are postponing the investment in

395
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,890
additional providers probably because of

396
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">economic conditions and are leaving the</font>

397
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,660
internet but mostly we're not going to

398
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:14,179
one provider either they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

399
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,510
carrying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli homes prefixes are</font>

400
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,680
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sweet spot they just renew</font>

401
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,150
someone will<font color="#E5E5E5"> bop down to two someone</font>

402
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:24,050
will go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to four but usually they stay</font>

403
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:26,570
at three the interesting kind of thing

404
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:28,149
here is the subset of highly<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home</font>

405
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,500
prefixes with four or more providers

406
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:34,070
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually becoming a larger and more</font>

407
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:35,630
stable class over time they renew in

408
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,730
other words if you have 4 plus providers

409
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,370
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly likely to have 4 plus</font>

410
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:46,010
providers next year you don't tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

411
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:48,320
down 23 22 21 and so really this is

412
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,780
about where this idea ends we thought

413
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,419
that we might get some some break we

414
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,770
thought we might see the growth of the

415
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,230
internet slow down at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least a little bit</font>

416
00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:00,870
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the financial train wreck</font>

417
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:04,020
worldwide but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think cheap</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Transit has</font>

418
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:07,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">killed that theory as I say there is</font>

419
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,720
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence that these 30,000 plus a</font>

421
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,290
rational economic players and figuring

<font color="#CCCCCC">out how to multi home and what they're</font>

423
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:17,580
going to pay for next year they're just

424
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,890
delaying their purchases like we all do

425
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,480
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> big-ticket items</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on contractual items</font>

426
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:25,260
when your future is a little uncertain

427
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:26,640
and as I say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe not</font>

428
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:29,910
a bad thing because obviously we want to

429
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,840
start weaning these<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30,000 asses off the</font>

430
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:36,660
idea that they can multi-home trivially

431
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:38,159
after the v6 transition they're gonna

432
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,010
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell for a lot less so growth</font>

433
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:44,670
continues and you know all I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say is</font>

434
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,170
bring on the v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> aftermarket because you</font>

435
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,190
know this is peripherally connected but

436
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:50,760
i think the stuff we heard this morning

437
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">was pretty neat address space is</font>

438
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,740
valuable things that are valuable have a

439
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,960
price that price will either get

440
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,720
discovered in the market or in the black

441
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,210
market it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> better for all of us I</font>

442
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,460
think if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes out in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the light and</font>

443
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:06,780
we can regulate the market and get price

444
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:13,400
discovery out in the open where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

445
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:15,600
all see it it's my two cents<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it oh</font>

446
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:18,030
we have time<font color="#CCCCCC"> for questions if there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

447
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,219
any and while we're doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

448
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:24,540
gonna have gel lately up to the front

449
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:28,740
ready to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this learning tool no</font>

450
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:32,220
questions I spy Randy versa oh yes Randy

451
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">bush I urge a yes sir seeing as bgp is a</font>

452
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:37,800
brilliant information hiding protocol

453
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:40,230
and their papers after paper which

454
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,840
demonstrate that looking at bgp data

455
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:45,930
from vantage point like route views are

456
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,419
is and Renesys don't tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> much about</font>

457
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,850
the real topology of the internet I'm

458
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:52,110
kind of wondering how you judged

459
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:56,129
somebody had

460
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:58,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">only one provider oh it's not a value</font>

461
00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:02,210
judgment right<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean you could have a</font>

462
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:06,540
really good provider it's all you need

463
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:10,400
how did you judge how many people had

464
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:14,389
only one provider i'm calling

465
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay when you say talk to me after</font>

466
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,880
Patrick El Morocco<font color="#E5E5E5"> might when you said</font>

467
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,620
provider I assume you meant transit

468
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:25,890
provider yes so if somebody is not large

469
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,879
enough to have call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering even if</font>

470
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,700
it's paid pairing or whatever

471
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,980
relationships with say the entire DFC

472
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,630
then you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to see that</font>

473
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,400
prefix through other providers you have

474
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:37,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to see a longer areas path they have to</font>

475
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:39,270
be announcing and propagating it right

476
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:42,980
that's or so I would call that not

477
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would call that science I</font>

can't add to that I'm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font>

this is I'm Joe ably I'm currently I can

490
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:34,460
Matt Larsen from verisign<font color="#CCCCCC"> help write</font>

491
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,530
these slides he's not here this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

492
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:39,140
slide deck which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> too large for the</font>

493
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:40,610
slot it was largely something that was

494
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">presented at the right meeting in Lisbon</font>

495
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:45,070
the other week and so all the slides are

496
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,090
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to skip to a lot of them</font>

497
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,100
the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's worth mentioning</font>

498
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:50,840
up front is this is an informational

499
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,090
update for people who know or care about

500
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:55,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS say if you don't know what dns sac</font>

501
00:22:53,090 --> 00:23:00,980
is then there's not space in 10 minutes

502
00:22:55,670 --> 00:23:03,380
to teach you so the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

503
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:06,890
talking about is a collaboration between

504
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:10,850
I can verisign and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US Department of</font>

505
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:12,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Commerce and there are various sort of</font>

506
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,050
marketing type phrases here and skipper

507
00:23:12,410 --> 00:23:17,960
villains so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point here is that</font>

508
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,520
signing a zone in with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS sake is</font>

509
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,920
typically something that an individual

510
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,930
organization will do the root zone is a

511
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,540
little special for mainly political

512
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:28,490
reasons and so with the root zone we

513
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:30,379
have multiple parties involved in this

514
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,850
exercise and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is the novel</font>

515
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:36,170
feature of this project which is what

516
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:39,199
I'm talking about so the first roll the

517
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:42,140
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization is is I can hear I</font>

518
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,500
can is managing the the KSK one of the

519
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,210
two dns keys in the zone<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can well</font>

520
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,700
except the d/s records from TLD

521
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:51,500
operators this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how a TLD sends its</font>

522
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,020
public key into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root zone so that</font>

523
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:59,240
validators can<font color="#CCCCCC"> can know to trust records</font>

524
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:01,720
of nez own I can verify some posters the

525
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,880
request i can send the request

526
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,400
commerce so for those not familiar with

527
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,530
the current unassigned chain of command

528
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:11,140
in making changes to the root zone this

529
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,720
largely follows the same pattern I can

530
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:15,160
collecting information US Department<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

531
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:20,860
Commerce authorizing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in verisign</font>

532
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:24,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">publishing it so in specifically with</font>

533
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,719
DNS SEC the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DLC will authorize des</font>

534
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:29,200
record changes which they don't

535
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently do dns key sets which he also</font>

536
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,390
don't do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they also check that i can</font>

537
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,830
has followed<font color="#CCCCCC"> the various procedures that</font>

538
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're obliged to follow when</font>

539
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:43,780
authorizing requests that arrived from

540
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">TLD managers verisign managed as the</font>

541
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:48,070
zone signing he better that they

542
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,860
implement the changes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia</font>

543
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:53,679
authorized they sign this own and they

544
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:57,639
distribute the same so same as today

545
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:59,050
plus dns say so here's the same thing in

546
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,730
diagram form<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not sure if you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

547
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:06,129
this same sort of idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> i went to all in</font>

548
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:10,060
it the slides are on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page i think</font>

549
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:13,120
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at in more detail so</font>

550
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:15,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">as far as protecting the KSK go is in</font>

551
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,860
the x.509 world there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this concept of</font>

552
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,169
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPS which outlines and specifies the</font>

553
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,510
security practices surrounding key

554
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:25,450
management and for DNS SEC we have this

555
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:27,190
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> called a DPS DNS SEC policy and</font>

556
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,580
practice statement and this is based on

557
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,720
a framework developed by the SE people

558
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:35,830
it's actually being pushed through the

559
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:37,540
IETF as a publication process so the DPF

560
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,490
specifies all the things that anybody

561
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,870
ought to need to know about in order to

562
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,970
be able to order the procedures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

563
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:45,280
carried<font color="#E5E5E5"> out or in order to gain</font>

564
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:47,350
sufficient confidence and trust for

565
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:52,690
their own purposes that the procedures

566
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:57,520
are adequate here's here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that another</font>

567
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:59,800
nice omnigraffle<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram so as part of</font>

568
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,050
this whole process one<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference from</font>

569
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,629
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the x.509 commercial ca's work</font>

570
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:06,850
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we will involve community</font>

571
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:09,700
representatives in this process so when

572
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:12,709
we have key ceremonies in order to

573
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:15,860
create or destroy or use

574
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:17,779
the KSK in a secure facility those

575
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,580
ceremonies will involve third parties

576
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:22,399
that are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can they're not verisign</font>

577
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,809
they're not US government so part of

578
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:28,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">those people will have hands-on roles</font>

579
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:30,678
actually exercising crypto cards smart

580
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,669
cards as crypto officers in order to

581
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:33,549
actually use the hardware security

582
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:35,299
modules that contain the key material

583
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:37,250
other people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have responsibility</font>

584
00:26:35,299 --> 00:26:40,490
for smart cards which are basically

585
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,020
backup shares of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the KSK which are then</font>

586
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,480
distributed widely so that in the event

587
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:51,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a disaster you can recover a KSK</font>

588
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:53,559
using those both those<font color="#E5E5E5"> those shares we</font>

589
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:55,909
expect to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have third-party auditors</font>

590
00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:58,340
check that I can is following the

591
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:00,230
procedures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've documented and we</font>

592
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:04,370
also expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ceremonies to be open</font>

593
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:06,140
weave we expect if we are able to to

594
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,418
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> webcast the entire ceremonies</font>

595
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,620
in real time if for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason</font>

596
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:11,210
that's not available<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's</font>

597
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,139
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the video the recorded</font>

598
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,850
video will be published shortly

599
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:21,799
afterwards so here are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technical</font>

600
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:23,959
details the KSK will be a 2048-bit RSA

601
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:27,440
key which will roll every two to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

602
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">years as a schedule on a not scheduled</font>

603
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,130
an emergency<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all others will happen</font>

604
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:32,658
of course whenever there's an emergency

605
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:35,750
we'll use 5011 for automatic key

606
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:38,779
rollovers and we will use signatures

607
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:41,000
based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 256 so there's an</font>

608
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:43,669
operational implication of this which is

609
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that char 256 for use in DNS SEC has</font>

610
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:47,480
only very recently been documented it's

611
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">only just received as code point and as</font>

612
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:52,789
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I know no shipping code actually</font>

613
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:54,110
supports this so that might sound

614
00:27:52,789 --> 00:27:55,520
slightly universe to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

615
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,110
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody can use and at the</font>

616
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,370
same time this does force every

617
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:00,110
validator who actually wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

618

assigned routes own to upgrade their

619
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:07,490
software before they start which might

620
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:08,960
well be a sensible approach there's only

621
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,870
signing key which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by verisign</font>

records for everything else in the zone

631
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,030
which is principally in a sureno in IRS

632

validity of seven days and those will be

635
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,340
we signed twice a day and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that frequency</font>

636
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,930
is because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the root</font>

637
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,750

00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:59,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's regenerated will resign verisign</font>

639
00:28:53,750 --> 00:29:02,240
will resign as I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will have</font>

640
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:06,610
key ceremonies whenever we have to

641
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,740
manipulate or otherwise refresh the KSK

642
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:11,840
and we will exchange data between

643
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,790
verisign<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can on a regular basis on</font>

646
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:21,050
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> four times a year of verisign</font>

647
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,960
transmits a key sighting request which

648
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,909
contains a DNS key set and a requested

649
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,590
validity period and there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,420
ceremony in<font color="#CCCCCC"> which that is processed to</font>

651
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:32,270
the signatures are applied<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the KS k</font>

652
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,770
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the sunny novel part the way</font>

653
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:38,960
we split these operations between two

654
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:40,760
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can is the organization</font>

655
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these three that will publish the</font>

656
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:46,150
trust anchor for the root zone we plan

657
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:48,500
to publish this in a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ways</font>

658
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:51,010
it'll be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML wrapped document and a</font>

659
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:55,370
plein des record for cutting and pasting

660
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:57,680
we also publish a few pkc has<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten csr</font>

661
00:29:55,370 --> 00:30:00,350
and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for doing that is that</font>

662
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,590
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a format of key material is</font>

663
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:06,439
readily used by existing systems also

664
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,939
something that an existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 CA that</font>

665
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,820
you might already have someone degree so

666
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:14,560
ability to trust can easily sign using

667
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,560
the existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> X by the nine epist rupture</font>

668
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:22,490
so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to roll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this out in a</font>

669
00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:24,440
slightly conservative way I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

670
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:26,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into more detail in the security bath</font>

671
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,549
about exactly how we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but we're</font>

672
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to roll out the same copy of the</font>

673
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:33,500
zone on one letter at a time or a small

674
00:30:30,889 --> 00:30:34,699
number of letters at a time starting on

675
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,730
the first of December and then

676
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,289
continuing until the following june july

677
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:42,919
july i think july first have a slight

678
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:44,360
honest so while we're doing this we want

679
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:45,950
to watch the traffic profile for these

680
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,229
letters<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and find out what the</font>

681
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,399
reaction to deployed resolvers are to

682
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:51,139
the large responses they might receive

683
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:52,939
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they suddenly contain signatures</font>

684
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:57,469
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in an incremental</font>

685
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,059
fashion and the other weird thing we're

686
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,549
going to do is we're going to replace

687
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:02,870
the keys in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root zone which is</font>

688
00:31:01,549 --> 00:31:05,960
initially deployed in this incremental

689
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:07,129
way with keys that are not published so

690
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,240
it's not actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be possible</font>

691
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:10,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to validate anything in the root zone</font>

692
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,980
until we go finally live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> July next</font>

693
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,659
year so the whole purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

694
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,309
incremental rollout is to try and test

695
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:18,710
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's no network</font>

696
00:31:16,309 --> 00:31:19,940
conditioners middleboxes anything else

697
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,190
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break in some dramatic</font>

698
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,629
wholesale fashion because the response

699
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:25,210
size that you received from<font color="#CCCCCC"> priming</font>

700
00:31:23,629 --> 00:31:27,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">queries suddenly goes through the roof</font>

701
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:29,750
so if everybody suddenly on one day had

702
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deal with UDP fragmentation and TCP</font>

703
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:33,230
transport you might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem this</font>

704
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,669
hopefully is a way of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font>

705
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:42,559
these things early without breaking the

706
00:31:34,669 --> 00:31:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS so here's the timeline first of</font>

707
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,120
december this year the the root zone

708
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:50,960
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be signed again signed in such a</font>

709
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,639
way that it can't be violated does the

710
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,139
sign zone will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be tested internally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

711
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:56,500
start with we'll start rolling this out

712
00:31:54,139 --> 00:32:00,649
letter by letter on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root servers</font>

713
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:02,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">july next year we will roll the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> KSK and</font>

714
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:05,809
then the signed route we fully deployed

715
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:07,219
so July 2010 is when a configured

716
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:10,340
validator with an appropriate trust

717
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:12,830
anchor can get to make use of DNS SEC

718
