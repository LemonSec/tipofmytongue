new initiative of the ripe NCC and most

11
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,120
of you will know the ripe NCC is kind of

12
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:06,570
the IP registry for Europe but maybe

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:16,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">soup herbs that's the wrong button I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah you can read the slides later</font>

16
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,690
well actually what might be interesting

17
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,890
is that well diverse first right and

18
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,500
right was kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> equivalent of</font>

19
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:31,140
nanog and them and on day<font color="#E5E5E5"> two the weapon</font>

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,810
CC started literally as a coordination

21
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">center for the web community so it</font>

22
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really was in a platform to provide</font>

23
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:41,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">services to the community and initially</font>

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:45,810
in mcc<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosted mailing lists organized</font>

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,670
meetings started to connect connectivity

26
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,860
or contact database which and later

27
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,770
turned out to be who is y pues database

28
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,009
and anon you<font color="#E5E5E5"> later and the NCC also</font>

29
00:01:52,770 --> 00:02:00,090
became the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR for the region yeah</font>

30
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,160
thanks so web<font color="#E5E5E5"> labs is in a way a bit I'm</font>

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:05,970
a way back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the roots of that so to</font>

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:08,669
provide a community tool and community

33
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,770
platform for not just for the web

34
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,350
community but also to broader the

35
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:16,500
broader operators community and that's

36
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:21,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">why I'm here so it doesn't happen again</font>

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all right so it's its first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">foremost a website you can go to lab</font>

39
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,340
store right or net and but it's most

40
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,589
important more importantly a platform or

41
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,050
tool and for the community and you can

42
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:36,750
you know look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the content test what's</font>

43
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,060
on there there are tools prototypes are

44
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,950
some articles and you can also leave

45
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,870
your comments and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> forms that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

46
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,940
can participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and why did we do</font>

47
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,480
this I mean initially<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are two</font>

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,079
sides to this and the ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCC</font>

49
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,149
use the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> labs platform to have a</font>

50
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,470
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a faster or feedback mechanism</font>

51
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,040
that they are membership and with a

52
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,400
broader community whereas in the past

53
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past few years the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NCC was in</font>

54
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,190
always very careful to<font color="#CCCCCC"> only publish</font>

55
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,200
full-fledged services which sometimes

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,819
took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot longer and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also in the end</font>

57
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,280
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we didn't know if the</font>

58
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:18,798
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end 18 what we thought</font>

59
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,870
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we had assumed they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted so</font>

60
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,410
this isn't a way to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more feedback</font>

61
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:27,500
and to have a faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> and feedback loop</font>

62
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,030
with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community so yeah the NCC</font>

63
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,760
we'll put our prototypes in our new

64
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:34,340
ideas you might have new features of

65
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,099
existing services or you know potential

66
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,500
new services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then see what the</font>

67
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:42,589
community like sorta membership legs and

68
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:45,560
then either go often develop it further

69
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,239
or maybe take it off again<font color="#E5E5E5"> if people</font>

70
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,150
don't like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but on the other hand it's</font>

71
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:51,769
also an open platform for for everybody

72
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,510
like all of you and fo instance a lot of

73
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,519
the presentations I've been seeing here

74
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,489
I'm I thought this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be perfect in</font>

75
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,079
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> research results for the types tools</font>

76
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,209
they might be interesting for others in

77
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,130
the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there would be perfect</font>

78
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:06,099
examples to put on vibe laughs and then

79
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:09,079
you know make it known to a wider

80
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:11,810
community also outside the Nano

81
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,819
community and then you can also in or

82
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,238
get feedback from others from get

83
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:19,219
feedback from from colleagues about

84
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:21,469
about the tools or about the ideas you

85
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,340
might have share your visa results your

86
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:27,500
research results with others yeah that's

87
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,969
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much what I just said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

88
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,880
get involved in developments from the

89
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,710
start and an influence<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some ideas</font>

90
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,330
and services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> presented there</font>

91
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:41,200
and I'm yes um get feedback on I'm stuff

92
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,000
that you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so that's URL</font>

93
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,380
their second screenshot<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,789
actually we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just launched</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

95
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,219
like last week<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the white meeting</font>

96
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:51,050
in Lisbon and you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> unsure of them it</font>

97
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,810
would survive like all the whole right

98
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,540
community jump on it but um it did so it

99
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,980
should

100
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:02,940
work today<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple of</font>

101
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,800
rules like right left rules first of all

102
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,000
it's open to anybody anybody can read

103
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,680
all the content that's on web labs if

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,390
you want to contribute you want to

105
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">participate in the forum so you want to</font>

106
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:16,560
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to submit articles or</font>

107
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,590
content we would ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to register</font>

108
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,780
it's it's very easy it Sam you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't ask</font>

109
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:26,789
a lot of questions and the and it is

110
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,770
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nicer to have like a conversation</font>

111
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">or communication between individuals and</font>

112
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,530
not anonymously and then the other rule

113
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,170
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot give any service</font>

114
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,669
guarantees about anything that's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

115
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,650
right blouse<font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guarantee</font>

116
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the platform</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works but whatever is</font>

117
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,299
on there and I'll could either be from

118
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:47,310
put on there by third parties or as I

119
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,080
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be prototypes or you know</font>

120
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:54,450
better versions and then based on oh I'm

121
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,460
sorry don't some you didn't hear any of

122
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:02,640
this I'm not going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> repeat it all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

123
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,430
thanks and yeah so based on feedback or

124
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,030
resources in our people we could take

125
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,760
things off or develop it further so just

126
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,320
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make like that clear just if you</font>

127
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,700
look on the site<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now you will see</font>

128
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,670
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there it might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

129
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:19,890
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you there's like a tool</font>

130
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:21,480
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> schenker</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the icy contributed</font>

131
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:24,210
that you presented last we get the right

132
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:27,720
meeting to measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS lameness and</font>

133
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,510
there is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff also that are</font>

134
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,510
currently at least at DM<font color="#CCCCCC"> NCC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> science</font>

135
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">group and developed that's based on the</font>

136
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:39,090
lot of data that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rsf you know I</font>

137
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:42,420
Piero's<font color="#E5E5E5"> data an error data is numbers</font>

138
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:45,299
it's called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inr DB metaphor of that</font>

139
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:47,700
and there's some lesson I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you know</font>

140
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:51,810
some movies that we did based on address

141
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:55,039
usage and some other tools and articles

142
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:59,070
you will find there I think that's it

me to jump up and down and wave my arms

165
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,690
are likely I wave my arms a fair bit but

166
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,760
jumping up and down is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

167
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:23,160

enough to even get started on that it's

170
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:31,110
not a explanation of why you want to do

171

174
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:39,390
at some DNS SEC basics very quick but

175
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:42,000
most I'm going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about why you</font>

176
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">should sign your data sooner rather than</font>

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,790
later because in reality you've got a

one-time never to be repeated freebie

179

opportunity to implement DNS SEC screw

180
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,870
it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not ruin your lives because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">once DNS SEC is widely deployed if you</font>

182
00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:01,440
mess up basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking your systems</font>

183
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,760
disappear from the network and that's

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,250
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> something doesn't fit well in</font>

your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> model so that that's the</font>

186
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,480
bottom line here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the time to</font>

187
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:13,470
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of why this is</font>

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time DNS SEC basics is just saying</font>

189
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:17,850
in a sec it uses public key cryptography

190
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,420
very similar to the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technology</font>

191
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,100
used in SSH however it one thing to make

192
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,490
very clear a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people keep asking</font>

193
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,490
about certificates for DNS SEC the NSX

194
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,950
does not use x.509 certificates in any

195
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:36,060
way shape<font color="#E5E5E5"> or form</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uses an anchored trust</font>

196
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:37,350
system so don't don't go out looking for

197
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:40,979
where to get assert you're not going to

198
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:42,510
find any trust is designed to start at

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root and follow the dean has</font>

identity dotnet has the appropriate keys

00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,460
to confirm es is identity and so from

205
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,830
that mechanism they can validate that

206
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:08,160
anything in es net came from me and was

207
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:10,380
not forged this is the perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font>

208
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:13,170
test an experiment is you're pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

209
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:14,520
free to mess up you can still make your

210
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">life miserable if you really work at it</font>

211
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,189
but it's a lot harder right now

212
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,140
once you published your keys and people

213
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,850
are generally doing validation you

214
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:25,850
really don't want to make up mess up

215
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,279
because you're gone people who queries

216
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:31,070
on your name will get an error<font color="#E5E5E5"> back it's</font>

217
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,560
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> surf fail they can't find you</font>

218
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,970
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get to you so if</font>

219
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,649
you wait too long and<font color="#CCCCCC"> people start</font>

220
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,910
training on validation<font color="#CCCCCC"> in large numbers</font>

221
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:43,010
your life will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worse simply</font>

222
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,760
signing your data has no real external

223
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:50,450
impact you've got signed 8 out there

224
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:52,160
people do queries with a request for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">SEC information get all your signature</font>

226
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,060
files but nobody's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

227
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,610
validation because nobody has any keys

228
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,140
nobody has any trust there's nothing to

229
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,290
validate their just simply a bunch of

230
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,610
extra DNS records that nobody ever sees

231
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,040
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this one is pretty much a</font>

233

publish tease it does have an impact

234
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,920
things are getting closer I'm actually

235
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,410
ahead of things by a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of months</font>

do next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just realized that</font>

239
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:26,060
never fixed it rude should be signed

242
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,020
nice but but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen next</font>

signatures maybe everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font>

246
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:42,829
usable quite yet but but there's really

<font color="#E5E5E5">signatures out there ComNet and edge you</font>

time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have lots of experience with it</font>

and oddly only once a sweetened

disappeared from the world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

258
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,480
because they left a dot out of a

posts I saucing hopes this was a DNS SEC

262

problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's evil it's going to</font>

00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:18,890
break everything no it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't the NSA it</font>

264
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:21,560
was a much more mundane and very

265
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:23,630
unfortunate typo in a configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> file</font>

266
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,399
or at least so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been reported by</font>

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who were involved</font>

being

worked on transferring your domain from

some rough spots that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has nothing to do</font>

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,640
particularly there right now the way the

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,660
would hope none of them would do that

284
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,730
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are an awful lot of</font>

285
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,469
registrar's out there and there's some

of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't feel real warm and</font>

287
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,640
fuzzy about so yeah they could decide

288
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,560
well I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to screw these guys up</font>

289
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,660
for taking their<font color="#CCCCCC"> business elsewhere once</font>

290
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:18,739
again until you publish your<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys though</font>

291
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:21,560
doesn't hurt anything until your<font color="#E5E5E5"> parent</font>

292
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:24,710
is ready develop your<font color="#E5E5E5"> signing policies</font>

00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,569

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:39,320
you can't have a mess up without a major

298
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:41,569
impact so do more testing the next

00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:26,150
sudden your users won't be able to find

317

<font color="#E5E5E5">scary on the other hand the low place</font>

where I work which is Lawrence Berkeley

323
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,589
National Laboratories is currently doing

324
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:44,300
validation and we has had very few prob

325
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:46,640
there were some glitches when gov was

326
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,839
first signed those have all been

327
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,750
resolved and things are running very

328
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,580
smoothly so far nonetheless validation

329
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:53,900
is a little bit risky but only for your

330
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:58,190
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> people it doesn't affect your</font>

333
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,860
can look at providing your public keys

to something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knight are or the</font>

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,340

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look out on your own but</font>

regularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to be automated</font>

378
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,120
make darn sure that you have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

thoroughly so things don't break you

381
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,290
also want to roll your keys at short

382
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,580
intervals compared to expiration you

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">might sign every 12 hours of the</font>

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,820
seven-day expiration that gives you an

average of six<font color="#CCCCCC"> days to fix the problem</font>

389
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,819
you might do it every day with say a

390
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,439
14-day key signature exploration that

391
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,829
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you two weeks to fix the problem</font>

00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,480
but you need to have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> signing occur</font>

393
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:19,020
at a higher interval that are faster

the network they're generally speaking

want to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 97 even though I I'm</font>

408

urging you to sign waiting a couple

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,570
disappear just because of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

424
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:37,740
probably won't care after you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

425
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,059
hit by the bus so that's the sort of

426
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,620
thing you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at I got some</font>

427
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:42,090
references to read up on things I

428
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,600
imagine you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of these before</font>

429
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,530
I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of them are new</font>

430
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,820
actually this isn't my latest set of

431
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,440
slides I don't know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to it</font>

432
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of extra references on</font>

433
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,650
the new set no I'll see if I can get

434
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,299
those shoved up to the web someplace so

435
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,720
you can see them but you've probably

436
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">seen them before so that's it pep talk</font>

437
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:02,280
over just get out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start</font>

438
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS because</font>

439
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,860
this is once again a one cent

440
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,860
lifetime opportunity don't pass it up

441
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,740
awesome thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Kevin</font>
