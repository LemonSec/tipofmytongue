23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,720
I'm hearing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel that this is</font>

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,330
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the more controversial part</font>

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,550
so so I hope you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are kind of like</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're like rejuvenated now and all</font>

27
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,250
ready to go so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through a</font>

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,960
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the slides again in terms</font>

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">of whether the issues going on with the</font>

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,149
Narron that affect you with it with an

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,280
Operations community 4-byte asn<font color="#CCCCCC"> s and</font>

32
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,410
that there's a policy right now saying

33
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,170
hey look you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give up for paideia</font>

34
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,880
sense as default and but yet the

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,830
community itself is now quite ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,000
support it I universally across the

37
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:59,160
board so what do we do who is clean up

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hewitt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whose data has been old and</font>

39
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,759
decrepit for years and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,710
cleaning that up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's been a</font>

41
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,310
serious initiative under way to make

42
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,959
that happen via policy there's a v6

43
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,390
policies of which we're going to be

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,020
talking about now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> relax transfer</font>

45
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,519
policies with that we just talked about

46
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:20,459
so again i'm sure you're fretting and

47
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,890
and aaron is here to help you actually

48
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,020
you're here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron because you're</font>

49
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ones who are making aaron happen</font>

50
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:33,090
it's not us as me as an errand employee

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,920
or others that work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

52
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">really you as members who make these</font>

53
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,440
policies happen we just go ahead and

54
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,989
enforce them so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

55
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,940
talk about v6 policies and how impacts

56
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,570
operations business internet you know

57
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,760
you name it so the panelists against the

58
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,340
same panelists so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to hear</font>

59
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,040
them once more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can vote on a</font>

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,040
huge the best and put me it's a worse

61
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,519
place so here's go ahead and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,370
v6 policies we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a lot</font>

63
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">of operational experience yet did backup</font>

64
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:09,540
policy in terms of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> works and what</font>

65
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:11,880
doesn't we do have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for v4 we've had</font>

66
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,030
years and years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and years of this I mean</font>

67
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,600
v6 traffic is like less than a fraction

68
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:19,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">of one percent so far as a total value</font>

69
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,880
but we're definitely need to gain some

70
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,640
experience may

71
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,740
sure we have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> do right do things</font>

72
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,929
right and on an analyst there's this

73
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,820
recent discussion on assignment sizes

74
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:33,270
what was too big was too small what's

75
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,980
just right and really as air and<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff</font>

76
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,720
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no idea it's really up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

77
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,140
guys to actually tell us hey this really

78
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,600
seems to make sense route filtering what

79
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,820
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sense here there / 48 that</font>

80
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,329
are being routed right now through the

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Micra allocation policy for critical</font>

82
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:53,970
infrastructure so if they're filtering

83
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:56,100
on /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 tues that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> given ISPs for</font>

84
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,320
their allocations what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about those</font>

85
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:03,210
critical allocations and how are those

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,769
actually taken care of and they're sort

87
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,270
of the question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up a little</font>

88
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,550
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier in terms of those routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

89
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">effect policy actually affect Aaron</font>

90
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:12,450
assignment and allocation policies and

91
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,700
where does that play a role and it sort

92
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,700
of uncomfortable sort of situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

93
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">in saying well you know we give out</font>

94
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,019
allocations but we also want those

95
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,789
allocations have useful for you but on

96
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,289
the other hand that there's a whole idea

97
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:28,230
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> ralphs filtering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where is that play</font>

98
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,960
in effect and finally are the v6

99
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:33,150
policies are there today are they are

100
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">they affect adversely affecting rolla</font>

101
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:37,260
and are there things that could be done

102
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:40,140
differently that could actually progress

103
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:44,520
this in a much faster way because we do

104
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,500
have this v4 issue coming up in a couple

105
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">of years in terms of what's gonna happen</font>

106
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:51,150
with v for once we run out so our

107
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:55,620
speakers are going to be talking about

108
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:58,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and so I'm going to bring up the</font>

109
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:04,470
first one here and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Igor you're</font>

110
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:07,200
up first right oh you're at last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok why</font>

111
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,720
don't you come up first and i'll go

112
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,940
ahead and make this make this order<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

113
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:23,340
don't know why that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened but that's</font>

114
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:25,350
where it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so ipv6 policy well the</font>

115
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">good if you're an established is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

116
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:31,220
getting ipv6 basis really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy it</font>

117
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:34,520
took us under 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

118
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,510
really go ahead fill out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the form you</font>

119
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:43,450
will get the space that's great the bad

120
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:46,550
well there's a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and an RPM or</font>

121
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:48,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">NPRM or whatever that is that you must</font>

122
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:51,080
announce all<font color="#E5E5E5"> your out as a single</font>

123
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:53,830
aggregate and I firmly<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

124
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,969
that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> hindering v6 deployment</font>

125
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:58,430
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not everybody is willing to</font>

126
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,780
put all their eggs inside a single / 32

127
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:06,080
basket right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo for example has</font>

128
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,760
180 some odd different routes if one of

129
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,630
them gets hijacked only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them gets</font>

130
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">hijacked with a single / 32 if that 32</font>

131
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:17,090
gets hijacked all of Yahoo's down

132
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,980
different reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> is traffic engineering</font>

133
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,919
if you can't do traffic engineering like

134
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:24,050
we're used to doing with ipv4 two

135
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,150
engineers traffic for some data centers

136
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,550
different than others for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some specific</font>

137
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,950
net blocks like inbound mayo or crawl

138
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,620
different than others then that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

139
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,940
workable solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us all so what</font>

140
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,430
happens if you do any cast across

141
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:42,140
multiple clouds do you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to burn a</font>

142
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:45,470
you know entire ipv6 / 32<font color="#E5E5E5"> 41 IP address</font>

143
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:47,659
that doesn't work and of course multiple

144
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">discrete networks what about multiple</font>

145
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:53,330
not connected data centers or a bunch of

different<font color="#CCCCCC"> branch offices a single / 32</font>

147
00:06:53,330 --> 00:07:03,260
just doesn't cut it but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you</font>

148
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope 2009's 5 is a policy</font>

149
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:09,380
proposal that's going to be voted<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,969
hopefully this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron meeting for ipv6</font>

151
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:16,250
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> discrete</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network a location</font>

152
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:19,640
that should address some of it also I

153
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:22,270
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2009 7 is up for discussion and</font>

154
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,820
will be voted on probably later<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

155
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:28,219
which will actually proposed removal of

156
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,909
the single aggregate requirement that is

157
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:34,970
a good thing like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron said before</font>

158
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:38,720
please vote it does make a difference

159
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,800
and it will help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with v6 rollouts so</font>

160
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,800
thank you

161
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:48,359
alright so next is Dan so he was

162
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally intended for being first but</font>

163
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:57,890
we'll go ahead and play with us a little

164
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:57,890
bit I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I loved one dose I getting better</font>

165
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,870
so I should probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> qualify these</font>

166
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:11,730
slides before I get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little too deep in</font>

167
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:14,940
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am i'm not saying v6 is going to</font>

168
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:18,180
be easy that it's a done deal that we

169
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:20,610
don't need a ton of policy work and a

170
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,860
large<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of efforts by everyone</font>

171
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:27,180
involved but that is already<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

172
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,100
the one of the reasons i made this

173
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,630
slides is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you who are</font>

174
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually following some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of we're</font>

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting to the end things are getting</font>

178
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:42,299
tight and you know humans<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

179
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:44,570
tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to panic when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things get scarce</font>

180
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:47,010
so you hear a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussions about</font>

181
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,680
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> ration this or we should</font>

182
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:52,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">exclude a certain industry or deny</font>

183
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,750

184
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,710
force v6 on everybody or we need some

00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of regular regulation and the point</font>

that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're there and that</font>

put all these pieces in place i would

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> i often look at this a slightly</font>

different way v6 deployments are

increasing even in spite of the fact

that

209
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,670
most calculations show we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have two</font>

years left of v4 address space that

doesn't mean oh we're good<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can</font>

to put all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this in place so it's not</font>

215
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,790
prudent to wait until the last minute

consistently been sliding out a little

bit but the current lack of v6

226
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:07,470
visibility doesn't mean that everyone's

ignoring the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> Comcast as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP</font>

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,540
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the the time frames that are</font>

really<font color="#E5E5E5"> run the potential of getting left</font>

certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases you can turn this up in a</font>

00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,790
relatively short order for some networks

251
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:33,040
this takes a long<font color="#E5E5E5"> time of planning so</font>

252
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:35,140
from my<font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective if you're not</font>

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,240
already working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you're going to</font>

255
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:46,210
because if you wait for v4 depletion to

256
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:53,010
happen it's already been too late that's

it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> X is actually going to be Kevin</font>

258
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:08,940
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you about</font>

whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be involved in ipv6</font>

260
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:15,180
routing policy simply stated when you

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,400
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the ER and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks about routing</font>

262
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,920
policy they say Aaron doesn't do routing

263
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,209
policy we assign addresses maybe they're

264
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,469
routable maybe they're not that's not

265
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:28,710
errands business but the reality is that

266
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:33,030
the Aaron NPRM talks about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> non the</font>

aggregate to a I said lar it's got the

wrong wrong acronym in there I apologize

270
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:45,360
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're the ISPs is supposed to</font>

aggregate to a single prefix a single /

272
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,380
32 and as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I'm concerned that</font>

273
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:53,310
means Aaron is dictating my routing

274
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:55,350
policy most significantly for me I can't

275
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:57,060
do traffic engineering I can give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:14,730
slowly well I discovered<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if I ran</font>

283
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,610
over ipv4 I had a 16 millisecond round

284
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:19,740
trip time to my home system over ipv6 i

285
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,450
had a hundred and seventy millisecond

286
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,270
round-trip time because everything was

287

bouncing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up washington DC i'm in</font>

289
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,820
from Washington<font color="#CCCCCC"> DC I wasn't even taking</font>

290
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:32,010
a real straight path between those

291
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:34,890
locations but we'll ignore those right

292
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:37,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">now the main thing is that i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one /</font>

295
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:44,370
since I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have any variables i can</font>

just a single / 32 they pick whichever

300
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,430
the middle so somebody flipped a coin

301
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,370
someplace and said we're sending the

302
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,439
ipv6 to Washington I don't know that was

303
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,330
a deliberate decision or just a fluke of

304
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,910
the universe but it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm now</font>

305
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,110
switched over to ipv4 and I find that

306
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,089
kind of embarrassing since I've been

307
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,070
standing up here plugging ipv6 for

312
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,529
an issue for those with a large

313
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,819
geographic footprint if you're a

314
00:15:19,529 --> 00:15:22,889
regional provider and all of your

315
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:25,139
systems are in a single state the

316
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,430
latency change is fairly minimal but

317
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:28,350
it's been pointed out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me since that</font>

318
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,120
many enterprises face similar problems

330
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,660
ever but very likely will do it for ipv6

331
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,910
if we're allowed to do so that allows

332

latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should mention es net is</font>

334
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,110
somewhat unusual and that our main goal

335
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:13,740
is not to move zillions of web page hits

336
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,899
and a few fairly moderate<font color="#E5E5E5"> sized video</font>

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,680
simply disastrous so we can't get away

<font color="#E5E5E5">with doing that we're going to have to</font>

346
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,399

there's no way to balance traffic flows

Aaron will actually take a / 10 and put

that aside as a block that they can use

there is at that policy when it got

introduced it allows allocation down to

the / 28 so in the worst case you know

if all of those 28 sout of / 10 get

<font color="#E5E5E5">just you know that that policy right</font>

426
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,700
there doubles the size of the routing

427
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:19,110
table in the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> case assuming they all</font>

428
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:22,350
get allocated as /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 s that's a 16,000</font>

429
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,840
new routes so this v6 policies not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

430
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:28,320
having impact on v6 operations that's

431
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,240
having limitations on v4 and you know in

432
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,070
most modern routing hardware I think I'm

433
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,390
seeing 512 thousand routes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB</font>

434
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:38,250
maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more where we're</font>

435
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting pretty close at that point in</font>

436
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst-case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scenario under 4 10 so I</font>

437
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,830
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody should pull up the nerve</font>

438
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,870
perm and take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at at four point 10</font>

439
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:49,290
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a interesting nuance in</font>

440
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:52,649
that policy and then I think yeah the

441
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:54,560
other one going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the v6 world the</font>

442
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,630
policy is not exactly friendly to

443
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,639
implementing bcp 16 which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the whole</font>

444
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,140
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is on separate LAN segments</font>

445
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,730
blah blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah we've been doing</font>

446
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:06,330
this for use it's just been tough as a

447
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:08,880
provider and and it's it's caused us to

448
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:12,449
kind of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to create our own path for</font>

449
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:18,570
a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make v6 DNS work in an anycast</font>

451
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:25,590
for our last speaker it's going to be

452
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:27,870
Aaron and hopefully you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are coming</font>

453
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:29,730
out some really good questions or things

454
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,449
that you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to discuss as we go</font>

455
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,450
through this as well

456
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we all obviously didn't talk</font>

457
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,080
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wrote these decks and we all</font>

458
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:43,120
wrote the same thing down<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm going</font>

459
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:46,980
to take this conversation to change a

460
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,989
little bit the real<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue here is is</font>

461
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron versus nanog right or policy</font>

462
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:55,000
versus operation why isn't there some

463
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of common consensus among us to</font>

464
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">create the best practice for us as</font>

465
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:03,070
operators inside of the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> in meetings</font>

466
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,990
we have people represented from all the

467
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,419
different portions of the community and

468
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,850
everybody's got different opinions it's

469
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:12,220
particularly tough around v6 right some

470
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:14,980
people want an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet that's exactly</font>

471
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,680
like the v4 internet with v6 I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

472
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:20,980
heard requests for things like NAT NAT

473
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:24,010
function in v6 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then 1918 like space</font>

474
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,840
for v6 which is pretty scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> some people</font>

475
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,430
want to redesign it so it's a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

476
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,500
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet diagram it was up</font>

477
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,360
earlier with the aggregated tier ones

478
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,670
and customers down so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so you have</font>

479
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,860
clean aggregated<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to customer</font>

480
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,850
hierarchy and and somehow you know

481
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:42,790
magically make v6 secure I don't know

482
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:45,429
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone spread the sum want us to</font>

483
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:47,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">prevent making the same mistakes we've</font>

484
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:49,000
made with v4 so they're redesigning the

485
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:50,620
internet architecture giving these

486
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,180
opinions in public meetings and the way

487
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,610
Aaron works is by community consensus

488
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,900
within Aaron to pass a policy so if

489
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:57,159
you're not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there contributing to</font>

490
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,930
these votes if you're not in their

491
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,910
credit giving your opinions and being

492
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,740
part of community consensus then you're

493
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">not being heard and that means even if</font>

494
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,980
there's only one person in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room</font>

495
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,929
that's right and 300 in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room that</font>

497
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:13,300
wrong are going to get the policy past

498
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:16,180
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big issue so the real issue is</font>

499
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,950
why vs why not and why aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

500
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:21,510
together why do we have two separate

501
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,510
meetings with very minimal overlap

502
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:28,410
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a slide that basically says</font>

503
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,159
the same thing as you just heard except

504
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:32,550
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just give a different</font>

505
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:34,890
perspective on this this the single

506
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:37,740
announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> breaks multihoming yeah</font>

507
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,210
well it who cares the policy does break

508
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming but look at the routing</font>

509
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:44,010
table we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing today you're</font>

510
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,390
supposed to have a single 32 to a single

511
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,980
asn you're not supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

512
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">assign space out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that 32 and then</font>

513
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:51,000
announce it to another s now<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

514
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,770
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird because some operators</font>

515
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,150
completely ignore this will take your<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48</font>

516
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:58,170
announce that give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing no</font>

517
00:23:54,150 --> 00:24:00,090
problem fixed others in this room follow

518
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,710
the policy they'll filter they'll say

519
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,709
hell no we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it this is aaron</font>

520
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,350
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> i I don't know why this exists</font>

521
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,120
today but we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we're acting in</font>

522
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:12,840
different ways as a community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

523
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,449
very strange and breaking things we are

524
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,669
lying to Erin we are lying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

525
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,710
registries we're being forced to do

526
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:21,480
things because of policies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">created or haven't created haven't</font>

528
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,770
participated in that will force us to do

529
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:27,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like a lie to get new space to</font>

530
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:32,220
meet HD ratios which we can't possibly

531
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">do there's no support for TV ha look at</font>

532
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,300
the routing table it's full<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic</font>

533
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,790
engineering prefixes I think there are

534
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,800
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2100 prefixes in the table and I'm</font>

535
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:43,080
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure over half of them are for TE</font>

536
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,690
and multihoming completely violates

537
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,010
policy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing why</font>

538
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:48,870
can't we write a document that makes

539
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,480
sense put this together and even some

540
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of best practice documents or</font>

541
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,930
policies that match you know get

542
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,770
together and actually come to a common

543
00:24:54,930 --> 00:25:00,180
decision that makes sense well<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font>

544
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:03,900
other note that wasn't mentioned is that

545
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:05,910
obtaining IP v-spec spaces is easy um

546
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,360
well there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> little odd thing in the</font>

547
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:11,700
v6 space policy that says you're

548
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,139
required to be in own ISP which is

549
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,310
pretty strange i actually ran meant to

550
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">this personally where i was trying to</font>

551
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:21,750
get v6 space only and and i had to

552
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:24,300
justify a need for v4 space and an<font color="#E5E5E5"> asn</font>

553
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:27,210
before I could even acquire v6 space

554
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,620
because I wasn't a known entity I think

555
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,420
there's a policy right now on the table

556
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,270
to make this go away but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just another</font>

557
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:35,490
odd anomaly anyway the short of this is

558
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,879
get involved and create some convergence

559
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,589
to

560
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:38,789
right now they are two very disparate

561
00:25:37,589 --> 00:25:41,428
entities and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing different</font>

562
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,899
things and as you can see this is a

563
00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:44,699
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in implementation it's going to</font>

564
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:53,458
be a headache as we continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

565
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:55,499
forward if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a change so</font>

566
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:58,979
either i<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to get taller our air</font>

567
00:25:55,499 --> 00:26:02,039
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get shorter so okay now's the</font>

568
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:05,729
time for questions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> come up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mic</font>

569
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,499
we have five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and I see</font>

570
00:26:05,729 --> 00:26:11,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kathy's up at the mic right now go ahead</font>

571
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:13,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kathy hi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kathy Aronson um I'm on the air</font>

572
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:17,219
and advisory council I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

573
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:19,499
what Aaron said we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need you guys</font>

574
00:26:17,219 --> 00:26:22,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to participate but it also occurred to</font>

575
00:26:19,499 --> 00:26:25,619
me that this is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very old policy</font>

576
00:26:22,219 --> 00:26:27,929
the v6 policy was written<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when Kim</font>

577
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:30,649
Hubbard ran errand so it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

578
00:26:27,929 --> 00:26:34,019
policy we had a lot of ideas then

579
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:36,089
obviously it doesn't meet your needs so

580
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:39,119
and there is a policy proposal written

581
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:42,208
by Aaron's wife do to change the policy

582
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:44,129
but we do need your we do need people

583
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:45,599
who do routing who do traffic

584
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:47,668
engineering and all that sort of stuff

585
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,379
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually stay at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year end and</font>

586
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:50,879
participate in the air in meeting and

587
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:54,809
I'd really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to encourage you to do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks so before own gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

i just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to mention one thing again</font>

590
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:03,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tuesday night there's going to be a</font>

592
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be talking about essentially gives</font>

593
00:27:05,969 --> 00:27:09,599
you some time to actually formulate to

594
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:11,158
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the policies that exist and</font>

595
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,079
there's issues that need to be brought

596
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,629
up that be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good time to actually start</font>

597
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:17,609
voicing us and if you have the

<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron level reflect routing is in my</font>

604
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:43,199
opinion a pretty bad place to do the

605
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:44,789
control of routing policy and I think

606
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:45,779
almost everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room if they</font>

00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:49,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">think sit through</font>

608
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:52,979
will agree but there's a lot of talk

609
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:55,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">about trying to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron policies the</font>

610
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:59,609
place where we control the growth in the

611
00:27:55,379 --> 00:28:02,158
routing tables and I think the example

612
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:05,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was put up there of this breakage</font>

613
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,769
caused by the must announce a single 32

614
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:11,189
is a good example of why that's a bad

615
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:13,259
idea and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would encourage the operator</font>

616
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:18,029
community to get more involved in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

617
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:20,519
and solve these problems I think that's

618
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:24,809
kind of the message from just about all

619
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:28,799
the panelists is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our borough Kevin</font>

620
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:30,869
saw phrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron claims not to set</font>

621
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,119
routing policy perhaps it should

622
00:28:30,869 --> 00:28:38,849
actually stick to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that claim and not</font>

623
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:43,428
write it in so please vote for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to</font>

624
00:28:38,849 --> 00:28:48,210
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> removed also like to note that that</font>

625
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:50,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">part of the reason these operational</font>

626
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:53,369
guidance or guidelines are being put in

627
00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:55,320
Aaron policy because today as an

628
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:58,468
operator community we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a place</font>

629
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:02,158
to document best practices and

630
00:28:58,469 --> 00:29:04,379
operations we<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanged presentations at</font>

631
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,210
nano we have conversations on various

632
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:08,248
IRC channels we talk to each other and

633
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,989
figure out best practices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

634
00:29:08,249 --> 00:29:15,299
no document repository that says this is

635
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:20,070
appropriate operator policy generally

636
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:23,849
speaking and that's problematic<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

637
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:26,789
comment on that I mean the organization

638
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:28,859
I'm with is a very new organization with

639
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:30,599
relative to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Allah the panelists here and</font>

640
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:32,099
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new blood in our</font>

641
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:35,549
organization who have not been around

642
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:38,249
routing and bgp and allocation for a

643
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:42,418
very long time and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us just want</font>

644
00:29:38,249 --> 00:29:43,969
to know why is why is a 24 the boundary

645
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:49,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">now we understand it's related to</font>

646
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:51,899
classful routing but in v6 why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

647
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,530
32 or why is it a 48 why did these

648
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:55,959
decisions come up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first place</font>

649
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:57,790
so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron saying there is no central</font>

650
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,000
repository and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who's just</font>

651
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:03,129
getting started maybe I'm going to start

652
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,650
an ounce and you know 56<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to the world</font>

653
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope they go and then when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

654
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:11,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't work I got to go ask you know on</font>

655
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,850
some mailing list and get berated so it

656
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:15,220
would be nice if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was an</font>

657
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:19,810
operational repository for this

658
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:21,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">information so we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to close the</font>

659
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,690
mic off because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're at the end of the</font>

660
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,940
session but going steals a little bit

661
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:31,630
more time so these questions can be

662
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:35,920
aired so after after Marla so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

663
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:40,390
I think you're up first<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kathy hi it's</font>

664
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:43,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Megan um the reason that there's routing</font>

665
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:46,690
policy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin policies even though</font>

666
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,120
Aaron doesn't do routing policy is

667
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:52,450
because when this policy was written

668
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,729
everyone on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron AC did routing and</font>

669
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,590
was concerned about routing table bloat

670
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:01,690
because i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the AC then it was</font>

671
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:05,679
maybe 11 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were trying to</font>

672
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:08,170
bring to bring operator information into

673
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:10,210
the policy and since then we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

674
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:14,650
to remove it because we don't do routing

675
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:16,810
policy but we were trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the</font>

676
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:25,240
right thing when this policy was written

677
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:28,120
so so Elena I think you're next elantra

678
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,340
home speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for myself someone think</font>

679
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,080
that this notion that routing policy and

680
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,760
addressing policy has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

681
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,530
different it is plain wrong this is one

682
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,379
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing especially if we are</font>

683
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:44,020
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with transfers if we're going to</font>

684
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:46,900
see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pressure for D aggregation</font>

685
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:50,470
somebody repeller was worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

686
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:53,020
used to be policy 2085 for the last

687
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:55,150
stash eight where we micro allocate up

688
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,160
to / 28 but first things are going to

689
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,060
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the future when will we be</font>

690
00:31:57,160 --> 00:32:02,620
such a premium on getting the force base

691
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,610
smaller and smaller blocks are going to

692
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:07,600
be announced

693
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:09,790
like it or not and I think that we

694
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,820
should really<font color="#E5E5E5"> try those addressing</font>

695
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,620
policies and both routing policies

696
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,960
together it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

697
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,549
asked to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing policy for me it</font>

698
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,440
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean that I shall do whatever I</font>

699
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:25,510
want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> us what Aaron says it me but</font>

700
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:27,309
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should talk that's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one body if I</font>

701
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">could comment on just that for a minute</font>

702
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,570
so when you go when you when you break

703
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:33,400
the / 24 boundaries you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to / 28</font>

704
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:35,080
there's engineering implications that go

705
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,470
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board not only for routing</font>

706
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,760
but also for dns so we start if we're

707
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,740
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepare for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and actually</font>

708
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,330
do it then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of vampire</font>

709
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:46,360
thats actually has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> expended beyond</font>

710
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,909
it what if as a lot of manpower but need

711
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:51,000
to be expend<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suggest that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we stop now</font>

712
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:56,200
because this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to be the reality</font>

713
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,630
understood so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Lee you're up</font>

714
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:01,320
next Lee Howard time warner cable also

716
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,678
so in that vein I want to thank errand

for volunteering to write a best current

718
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:12,280

719
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:14,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">volunteered good job i also want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

720
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:18,460
resist a little bit the exportations

721
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:20,199
that we hear that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> aaron says that</font>

722
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:24,220
they don't do routing policy then they

723
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:27,220
should not do that we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the words</font>

724
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you send us and gets discussed by</font>

policies to send better words so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

728
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:41,860

00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:44,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">you lee okay is that that Jason vector</font>

730
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:48,040
yeah okay Jason Schiller a verizon new

731
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:51,309

733
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:55,629
pretty much across the board

734
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:59,169
ubiquitously the answer is<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we</font>

735
00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:04,540
created a swamp Aaron started giving out

/ 24 s 2 n sites have known block

737
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:10,690
those that space got routed eventually

<font color="#CCCCCC">that led to the de facto filtering of</font>

00:34:17,168 --> 00:34:24,850
more or less now all ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> except up to /</font>

742
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:27,730

743
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:31,480
do the exact same thing in ipv6 which is

744
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:34,900
to make a de<font color="#CCCCCC"> facto routing policy of</font>

745
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:39,280
accepting up to 48 or perhaps even more

746
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:41,139
specific than 48 and the way i theorize

747
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:43,000
that is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people think that D</font>

748
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:45,040
aggregation is an acceptable solution to

749
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,350
provide our independence and to

750
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming then we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get P I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 48s in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the table then the PA holders are going</font>

752
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:54,490
to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> well i would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home</font>

753
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:56,350
also so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get PA 48 sin the table</font>

754
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:57,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we get a significant</font>

756
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,390
well we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the same traffic</font>

757
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:05,320
engineering capabilities that we have in

758
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:09,190
before on average<font color="#CCCCCC"> in v4 na s announces</font>

759
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,380
about 99 prefixes so we're going to need

760
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">to divide that up into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I don't know /</font>

761
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,630
52 s and everyone will have to listen to

762
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:19,630
those and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually we may whittle</font>

763
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,480
it down to / 56 because that's what

764
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:25,300
you're giving small office home users

765
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,040
and envy for you give them a 24 and they

766
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,350
can multi home and get one slot so if

767
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,310
we're giving them 56 is they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

768
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:35,710
able to multi home and get one's locked

769
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:39,250
the concern with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that approach is the</font>

770
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:43,000
routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table will get very big will I</font>

771
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:45,400

774
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:52,390
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the early adoption</font>

775
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:55,000
curve but that curve is expected to be

776
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:57,220
shaped and exit I expect it to ramp up

777
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:59,560
fairly quickly in the next year in the

778

next two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> before depletion occurs</font>

785
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,839
big and what I'm urging people to do is

786
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,420
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

787
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:21,190
they have look at the capabilities of

00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:24,069
the FIB of the routers they currently

789
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,930
have look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest router you can</font>

790
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:28,808
buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> today and what those capabilities</font>

791
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:30,669
are and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and predict out how big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

792
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:33,579

793
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:35,829

five years plus six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> worth of</font>

00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:42,969
forklift upgrade my entire network so

I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years out seven years</font>

798
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:46,509
out the routing table looks like it

799
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:49,359
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very big if widespread v6</font>

800
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:51,119
adoption occurs and we let all these

801
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,440
more specifics into the routing table

802
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,329
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I urge people to do is</font>

803
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,680
to not be naive about it do not let

804
00:36:55,329 --> 00:36:58,269
these prefixes into the routing table

805
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,919
now saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only two</font>

806
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:00,999

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll deal with the problem when it</font>

808
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:06,430
happens because<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we saw and before we</font>

809
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:08,710
never had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to drain the swamp</font>

810
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:10,899
we'll never get a chance to do it in v6

811
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:12,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you're hoping for an</font>

812
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,739
architectural solution to bail you out

00:37:12,489 --> 00:37:17,109
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as we're out more specifics</font>

814
00:37:14,739 --> 00:37:19,509
ubiquitously there'll be no reason to

815
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:21,519
pursue an architectural solution and if

816
00:37:19,509 --> 00:37:22,900
one does appear why would anyone

817
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:23,859
implement it when it's different than

818
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,170
what they're currently doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

819
00:37:23,859 --> 00:37:29,489
probably more complicated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe not</font>

820
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:29,489
even have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same capabilities</font>

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:41,020
okay so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marla oh go ahead you</font>

822
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:44,060
would like to respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I may</font>

823
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:48,440
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer to some of that is</font>

824
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:51,799
that to some big ISPs your refresh cycle

825
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:53,390
is seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> years it's the cost of doing</font>

826
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,750
business and perhaps it should be shrunk

827
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:58,069
down I won't argue the fact that yes it

828
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,380
would be great to have an architectural

provider with a few exceptions like me

847
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,180
but most of your out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a business</font>

848
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:46,730
providers you will look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business</font>

849
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,460
case you will decide can we afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

850
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:51,080
route half a million / 50 sixes and if

851
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,940
you decide we can trot half a million

852
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:55,370
plus 56 is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start telling</font>

853
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:57,140
folks that we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept</font>

854
00:38:55,370 --> 00:39:00,049
your / 50 sixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an acceptor</font>

855
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,190
whatever is appropriate those policies

856
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:02,930
are going to change they're going to

857
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,540
flex they're going to adjust as

858
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,980
equipment adjusts but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

859
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,660
different by the business case not by

860
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:11,570
what Aaron does and frankly not by what

861
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,730
nanog does<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh if in fact nanog actually</font>

862
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,920
does something we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really that</font>

863
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,050
type of organization but Aaron's work

864
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,400
also is not going to be what decides

865
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:21,890
this it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business case</font>

866
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:23,150
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose money I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're</font>

867
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:27,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to do it at least not for very</font>

868
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:30,220
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marla your other Marla is in here</font>

869
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:33,049
I'm for frontier communications at

870
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:35,810
another bottom line operators are who

871
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:38,510
control it what we do is what will

872
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:42,700
happen and yeah it's fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

873
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:45,050
policy coincides with what we do so a

874
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,750
the other bottom line which I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

875
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,730
asking for years since

876
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:51,700
I'm kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed this even compared to</font>

877
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:53,770
several you that around here one of the

878
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,259
charters needs to read that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they write</font>

879
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:59,170
routing policy now nods charter does not

880
00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:01,990
write routing policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin's charter does</font>

881
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:05,740
not write routing policy so either you

882
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:08,200
have choice a adjust nanog be adjust

883
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron or sea Krait yet another</font>

884
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,939
organization I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we all want</font>

885
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,000
another conference to have to we have

886
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:19,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough as it is so really our choices</font>

887
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,250
are who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do it and I can never</font>

888
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">get an answer to who's going to do it so</font>

889
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,920
I'm asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the community that's here</font>

890
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:28,810
who do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just the Charter and</font>

891
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,420
right into it that there's actually

892
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be routing policy Alton Marla I</font>

893
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,260
think you left another choice out there

894
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay go for it they choice out there is</font>

895
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody writes the routing policy</font>

896
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:44,109
and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody writes their own</font>

897
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,970
because my<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers my policy right and</font>

898
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,500
that's kind of what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main point is</font>

899
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:49,810
about operators what they do is what's

900
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,550
going to happen but we're hearing a lot

901
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:55,660
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people saying they like to at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

902
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:59,650
have one centralized policy that people

903
00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:03,220
should do their best to follow there are

904
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:06,160
best practices but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again my routers my</font>

905
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:09,490
policies I get it so folks we're running

906
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,259
way over the time limit here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and raz if</font>

907
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:13,270
you wouldn't mind getting your panel up

908
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,890
here on the side guys if you wouldn't

909

910

while Randy gives his question at the

911
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:22,240

923
00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:01,240
longer than the / 19 and we all said

okay we'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean live a couple years</font>
