1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,890
awesome thank you are you so our next

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,780
presenters are Richard<font color="#CCCCCC"> steenburgen and</font>

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,700
layer communications and Abby Freedman

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:17,779
you probably know from lots of things

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:24,119
but is now oh now I've totally spaced it

6
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:25,680
the server central yes I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

7
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">say that access because obviously that</font>

8
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">would would date me to Samara thank you</font>

9
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:51,360
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you very much hello so we</font>

10
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,250
actually time this presentation to come

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,129
right after the m6 presentation when we

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,469
saw what they were proposing we thought

13
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,570
this is a perfect opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font>

14
00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">of talk about what else you could do</font>

15
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,810
with with an MPLS platform so hopefully

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">this will be interesting I'm to start</font>

17
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,729
off by<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quick recap of the kind</font>

18
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,780
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the history of exchange points so</font>

19
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:18,689
kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 gen platform was you know</font>

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,840
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that got together for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first</font>

21
00:01:18,689 --> 00:01:23,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">time to bypass ANS and as soon as you</font>

22
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,020
had multiple parties that wanted to

23
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:31,850
interconnect with each other you had may

24
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:34,560
which became originally an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

25
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:38,280
fitty eventually for for high-speed

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,650
access when<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-speed was 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Meg's it</font>

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,079
had a lot of problems hello head of line

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:45,450
blocking issues I had a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scaling</font>

29
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,889
issues but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it kind of worked most the</font>

30
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,130
time it passed you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

31
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,189
packets and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 Meg's was fine it</font>

32
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,229
wasn't wasn't that big a problem the

33
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,529
second generation of exchange points was

34
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:01,289
was ATM you had everything formats<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

35
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,290
pack<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belknap eventually the maze went to</font>

36
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,659
ATM and you had OC 3 and 0 c 12 speeds

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,640
and you had a program<font color="#E5E5E5"> called pure maker</font>

38
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,640
that built all you're here

39
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,040
connections on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maze and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

40
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,690
third<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was was the geeky</font>

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,700
exchange for its this is when basically

42
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:21,900
ATM died thankfully which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

43
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,589
people deployed a new generation of

44
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,940
switches which were mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-blocking</font>

45
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,830
you had passed she had the rise of

46
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Equinix you had you know links in am-6</font>

47
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:35,310
taking off you had you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

48
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,140
solid<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform for the first time where</font>

49
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,750
there weren't really that many issues

50
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,988
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Giggy was fast and fine and then</font>

51
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,150
eventually you know 10 gige became the

52
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:48,060
thing and you saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of transition</font>

53
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,650
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the existing gig exchange boards to</font>

54
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,610
the 10 gig and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them deployed</font>

55
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,989
new platforms in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process but the</font>

56
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,910
exchange points themselves stayed the

57
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:59,090
same so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been you know since</font>

58
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,140
Giggy there's been pretty much no one's

59
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:05,580
massively swapped out their exchange

60
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:07,500
points for an entirely new one kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

61
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,300
quick overview of how all the modern

62
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,370
exchange points work today they're

63
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:13,799
almost exclusively ethernet-based as

64
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:16,290
we've seen this is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> driven by the</font>

65
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:20,940
commodity price of Ethernet thankfully

66
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:24,420
ATM died a horrible death at OC 12 we're

67
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:27,269
all very happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the exchanges really</font>

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,328
became Giggy and then as we saw in the

69
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:32,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous slides</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 ke + n by 10 gige has</font>

70
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,350
been the primary growth for for quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

71
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,070
while now and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be in till</font>

72
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:40,500
till we have faster options right now

73
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:43,200
they operate almost exclusively as flat

74
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,720
layer two vlans and what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> means is</font>

75
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,060
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i-x everything is interconnected</font>

76
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,160
layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> two there'll be an IP block</font>

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,890
usually at 24 sometimes it'll be a 23

78
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,320
sometimes will be 25 but somewhere in

79
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,440
that range and every member will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

80
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:01,230
assigned an IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and every member</font>

81
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,140
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected to nail this IP address</font>

82
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,429
to one router with one mac address

83
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:07,828
they'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to any other</font>

84
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,810
member because it's a flat layer to

85
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:13,019
exchange there'll be some broadcast

86
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,180
traffic typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> art but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as pretty</font>

87
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:16,769
well policed if an exchange is well run

88
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,709
they're monitoring this<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're they're</font>

89
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,139
keeping tabs on

90
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,960
when people configure protocols that are

91
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:25,330
intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run over the exchange or</font>

92
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,650
things that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be bad they they keep</font>

93
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,419
tabs on this and they'll send these guys

94
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,280
an email or if it comes down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it</font>

95
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:34,180
they'll shut off the port so you know

96
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,190
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange is mostly work and here's</font>

97
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,000
just kind of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a</font>

98
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:43,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">large topology and you see right now</font>

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,630
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big exchange point is you know 8</font>

104
00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:01,570
mean it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work well here's the</font>

106
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,889

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,049
forwarding loops very easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

108
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:11,380
there's no TTL there's no method to

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,810
expire the packet and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really easy</font>

110
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,460
to cause a broadcast storm have all that

111
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:16,990

112
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:19,539
you create a broadcast<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lupul there you</font>

of failure and this not only can take

115
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,990
down the exchange but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can actually</font>

know there's sometimes there are real

and the options and sometimes there are

122

but you really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be careful about</font>

123
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,639
where you connect to to make sure that

router with one mac address one IP and

134
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:10,750
that's pretty much it and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,210
going to have well-trained<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff that</font>

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,049
happens and there's examples of poorly

run exchanges that have had loops

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,919
have persisted for 48 hours so it

144
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,150
happens the other big problem with the

145
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:34,789
the whole architecture is the

accountability the reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is most</font>

147
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:39,229
routers have poor or no mechanisms for

measuring traffic over a layer to

your router as a member the problem is

152
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,889
it doesn't provide Mac layer information

153
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,690
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't measure in</font>

is measure<font color="#CCCCCC"> albela traffic by next hop</font>

156
00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:01,729
and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of platforms that</font>

157
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,580
can't run can't run a net flow at all

158
00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,710
you know cisco catalyst 6500 say these

you covered very popular platform very

174
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:41,509
not one-to-one you know you're still

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be off and you could be off by</font>

176
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:47,270
as much as five percent that's not

177
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:49,219
really acceptable for billing purposes

178
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,529
you can't sell some of the service and

179
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:55,009
say and plus or minus five percent

180
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:57,169
that's that's bad and the reality of Mac

181
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:59,960
accounting is most platforms just don't

182
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,460
support it at all<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's very</font>

183
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,500
difficult to integrate any of these

somewhere and all of these are pretty

192
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,849
bad choices so if you can't figure out

193
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:24,110
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build someone you can't really</font>

196
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,780
the exchange points then become a poor

choice for delivering build services

198
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,659
you've got the fundamental security

whether this is desired or not so you're

00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:43,870
vulnerable to traffic injection from

other peers who are directly connected

204
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:48,470
there's situations where you're

208
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,010
it either to their customers which is

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is you know bad for</font>

a bad thing for selling transit like I

255

layer to network the problem with

256
00:10:46,869 --> 00:10:50,349
redundancy is that it's provided by

257
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,909
spanning tree or some other vendor

258
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:54,999
proprietary thing which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

259
00:10:51,909 --> 00:10:57,129
thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be faster and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

260
00:10:54,999 --> 00:10:58,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want redundancy you create a</font>

261
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:02,199
loop and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to block the loop</font>

262
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:04,089
so there's large portions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of layer to</font>

263
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:06,998
exchange point networks that are sitting

264
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,399
idle you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for handling that</font>

265
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:11,769
failure and to protect every possible

266
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:13,869
failure case you're you're putting a

267
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:16,539
large amount of money into gear that

268
00:11:13,869 --> 00:11:18,249
sitting idle and idle here obviously is

269
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:21,218
wasting money<font color="#CCCCCC"> and increasing the cost of</font>

270

the service for everybody spanning trees

271
00:11:21,219 --> 00:11:27,399
is like I said a very very poor way to

272
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:30,249
control that traffic flow so if you lose

273
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,869
a large link and you have two other

274
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:33,279

symmetrical network and even the best

279
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:48,089
the largest exchange points you know

00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,540

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,860

do IP ipv6 that has been been added but

386
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:05,859
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really able to use this</font>

platform to do transport services

388
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,939
summing the bottom line the later to

389
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,339
exchange points we managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them</font>

391
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,329
free peering but there's a lot of

392
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:19,129
inherent problems it's an unstable

393
00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:23,199
system and we've put a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font>

394
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:25,610
effort into<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that it works</font>

395
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:28,490
but fundamentally the architecture

396
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,430
itself it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor choice to buy or</font>

397
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:34,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">sell services deliver full transit to do</font>

398
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:37,638
transport handoffs it's it's not taking

399
00:16:34,939 --> 00:16:41,689
full advantage of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure</font>

400
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:44,800
that's there so obvious going to talk

401
00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:44,800
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to engineer</font>

402
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:52,718
so the most common architecture of the

403
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:55,419
modern exchange point is that there's a

404
00:16:52,719 --> 00:16:57,459
shared broadcast domain and that leads

405
00:16:55,419 --> 00:17:00,389
to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the complications in terms</font>

406
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:03,128
of operational complexity to prevent

407
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:05,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">excessive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcast and security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

408
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:08,019
because all the broadcast goes to

409
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,699
everybody an alternative architecture is

410
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:11,799
something that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw in</font>

411
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:15,669
whatever again that was jen three or so

412
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,279
which is etm frame relay exchanges where

413
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:19,149
you actually have point-to-point

414
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,579
connectivity between the different

415
00:17:19,148 --> 00:17:25,779
members<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the exchange so sort of like</font>

setup<font color="#E5E5E5"> process because it isn't the big</font>

420
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:40,119
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it gives you some security</font>

421
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:42,070

00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:44,350
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet simple way to do this is</font>

exchange a lot of the current largest

425
00:17:46,749 --> 00:17:52,330
exchanges do actually allow you to add

<font color="#CCCCCC">vlans to your port and do some element</font>

00:17:56,129 --> 00:18:01,480
so with<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs you can actually have</font>

430
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,769
multiple connections that could be point

431
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,379
or multi-point point-to-point a

433
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:09,939
with the shared land that's the exchange

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">point and of course this was how some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

435
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,769
the older exchanges ran back when we had

00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,860
pure maker and like you the king of

437
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:19,419

438
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,820
some reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> why people haven't taken</font>

440
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:25,990
space to do tons of point-to-point and

441
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,689
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is limited VLAN space</font>

442
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:32,350
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually start having to have people</font>

443

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,419
even just<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the scalability</font>

458
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:14,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have vlans between every member in</font>

the exchange and have them be unique at

460

65 members you'd actually fill up the

straight layer to VLAN<font color="#CCCCCC"> rewrite solutions</font>

463
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,158
actually we did some work looking at

464
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:29,440
what one could do and a lot of those

465
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:31,570
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> wind up you can rewrite 40 in</font>

466
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,490
250 but you know you're still burning 40

00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,668
and 50 at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least on that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line card or at</font>

least on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch router so that</font>

469
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:48,179

470
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:50,740
exit in a straight VLAN veal and

471
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:53,649
implementation has to be the arbiter of

472
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,750
who can use what<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs and again most of</font>

473
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:57,789
the customers of<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanges are now not</font>

474
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:59,890
running straight routers although that's

475
00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:01,629
sort of changing but in any given

476
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,710
exchange point more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> half people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

477
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:04,630
going to be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are</font>

478
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:06,549
fundamentally switches that have grown

479
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,520
router capability we're fundamentally

480
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:12,100
that VLAN idea is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> unique is global</font>

481
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,590
across all ports not unique to that port

482
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,840
and so it puts the exchange operator in

483
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,459
this intermediary role you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

484
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:24,100
a complex provisioning and negotiating

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that management and the</font>

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,029
negotiation would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very difficult so</font>

488
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,429
what would you actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do if</font>

489
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:35,559
you wanted to implement get people away

490
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:37,570
from the shared broadcast get towards a

491
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:41,260
logical pni<font color="#E5E5E5"> but people could implement</font>

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,760
across the platform just doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans is</font>

493
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:46,929
difficult there just isn't enough

494
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:49,000

495

496
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,260
your exchange are going to take any VLAN

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,110
ID as global and

498
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,210
we write the tag rewrite technology

499
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:02,419
that's actually in most of the switch

500
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,250
routers is not that complex but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

501
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,320
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start looking at how you can do</font>

how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do VLAN interfacing and</font>

rewrite tags the vendors that support

509
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,350
this as a technology so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use mpls</font>

510
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:29,540
transport rather than ethernet switching

511
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,270
to enable the logical interconnects and

512
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:35,510
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about here having the</font>

518
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:48,169
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font>

519
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,210
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit further out into the</font>

520
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:52,340
exchange topology than what am-6

521
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,140
presented in that it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes down</font>

522
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,300
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configurations of the customer</font>

523
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,940
port but that's where it stops so with

524
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,530
mpls we've got an enormous namespace you

525
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,740
can have billions of virtual circuits

526
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:07,190
and its unique on your platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

unique that virtual circuit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PN I</font>

528
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,080
maps into that space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at the</font>

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">very edge you assign a VLAN which is</font>

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,110
at the handoff and the VLAN<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs then</font>

536
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,990
become something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can</font>

00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,990
bilaterally negotiate or you know set

00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:37,340
one of the very<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting things when</font>

539
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,070
we looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a deployment of this is</font>

540
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,780
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think this</font>

541
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,179
flexibility would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful the</font>

ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have party a and party B have</font>

543
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,840
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans but when you're actually</font>

544
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,550
doing this for peering there are a

545

number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that said you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

546
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,730
could get very confusing knock wise if

547
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:55,820
we have different VLAN IDs on this

548
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,770
exchange on this P&I so you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some of the complexity of having to</font>

550
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,800
negotiate between the parties which

<font color="#CCCCCC">VLANs are used or not</font>

552

00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,460
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> VLAN oh jeez if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to to</font>

554
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:10,100
solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conflict and one of the really</font>

555
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:13,340
big things and we see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the m6</font>

556
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:16,219
move is taking running of the exchange

557
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,709
from layer 2 into layer 3 gives you

558
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,960
tremendous flexibility with both traffic

559
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering and scaling and also</font>

560
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,850
debugging the tools are just much more

561
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,010
flexible to do looking at the

562
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,709
infrastructure layer freedom layer 2 and

563
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:33,110
the protocols are give you much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

564
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:35,510
functionality and now instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also gives you operational</font>

567
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:42,530
advantages because if you've ever run

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:44,600
very large network you know that you can

569

have ports that are up that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not</font>

unless the people involved are engaged

585
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,919
in the bugs or malfeasance there are two

point-to-point or multi-point with v pls

592

you still have cam tables and there's

still a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> work going on</font>

smaller exchanges also it gives it takes

MPLS implementations of<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLS and v pls</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually hand someone port do Q and Q</font>

681
00:28:04,330 --> 00:28:09,010
and talk to a metro provider and all of

682
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:10,660
their customers can become customers of

<font color="#E5E5E5">the exchange now it's a policy question</font>

684
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,720
whether you'd ever want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to appear with</font>

someone or sell to someone that's

00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,640
implemented like that but it does vastly

687
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:21,190
open up the audience if you're in a New

688

York or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bay Area or or an area where</font>

689
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,020
there are a lot of companies probably

690
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:29,950
more than providers connected to those

691
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:31,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Metro transport fabrics so there's a</font>

692
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,800
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of simplicity in this model</font>

693
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:36,030
with billing a little bit more

694
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,290
complexity in terms of provisioning now

695
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:40,389
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has already been done by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worldcom</font>

701
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:59,770
addresses in ipv4 and ipv6 and so it's a

702
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:02,980
little bit of complexity but certainly

703
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:04,870
tractable certainly can be done so

704
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,780
summary the current exchanges are

705
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:10,330
working and in fact we're seeing some of

706

<font color="#E5E5E5">these kinds of technologies implemented</font>

709
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:18,010
certainly makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> given that people</font>

714
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,050
engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs to go into the</font>

715
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,750
fabric and

716
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:33,240
the entire solution and there's

717
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:37,950
operational overhead this operational

718
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,080
complexity and there's it's really

719

<font color="#E5E5E5">suitable just for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-service</font>

725
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,979
at least brocade and juniper have pretty

726
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,050
good functionality in the things that

727
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,790
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like switches with a ver started</font>

728
00:29:58,050 --> 00:30:01,409
life as routers or switches they've sort

729
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:04,710
of converged and can do both ethernet

730

732
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:15,810
to exchange platforms so questions

00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:18,140
comments resin Richard can take the

this presentation are you thankful mem 6

first of all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> into you issue on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

739
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:42,820
platform that's purports so it doesn't

00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:44,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">work that you in the sense you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> described</font>

741

here it might be different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

742

platform your platform it doesn't matter

743
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,749
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the layer to portion you can</font>

744
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">set the jumbo frames as big as your</font>

745
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:53,830
platform can support and it won't break

746
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,349
anything where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks is when the</font>

747
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:58,389
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 side is misconfigured because</font>

748
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:00,279
you have to know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet can't go</font>

749
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,959
through I've got to send an ICMP need

750
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:04,089
frag that's going to trigger path MTU

751
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:05,139
discovery so from your side it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

752
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:07,330
configure the biggest thing you can

753
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:08,799
support and you're happy and and then

754
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:12,218
the value<font color="#CCCCCC"> is negotiation with the</font>

755
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,989
devadasis to solve it yep yeah that's

756
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:16,239
also ate a little tuvalu security

757
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:18,940
problems you set for a shared platform

758
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:23,669
you can solve things on the routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> air</font>

759
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:29,589
people can do that but my comment is M

760
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:33,999
we do p I we in in a sense as you said

761
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:37,299
it will provide a attack and we have the

762
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:39,279
surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's hardly used well the</font>

763
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:41,499
reason is the reason in my opinion

764
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's hardly used it is what I see is</font>

765
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:49,229
that people don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change their</font>

766
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:52,149
their router configuration to at<font color="#E5E5E5"> export</font>

767
00:31:49,229 --> 00:31:53,979
they think it's an asset so some people

768
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:59,580
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we provide this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

769
00:31:53,979 --> 00:32:02,320
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this P I just actual port and in</font>

770
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,779
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than half of the cases we see that</font>

771
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">people just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that they</font>

772
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:10,419
are happy apparently with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exchange</font>

773
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:12,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">as it is so we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see many of the</font>

774
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:15,369
request of coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch this this</font>

775
00:32:12,429 --> 00:32:17,259
model basically so you know this has

776
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:18,339
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> available a lot of platforms that</font>

777
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:20,049
can actually you know where I'm a

778
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:23,090
customer and I've considered it and the

779
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:26,150
reasons that I don't personally use the

780
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:28,699
tags number one it's very limited in

781
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:31,040
scale there's only so many of these you

782
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,770
can do number two<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into vlan-id</font>

783
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,420
negotiation so I don't want to you know

784
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,710
spend time and it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time if you</font>

785
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:39,200
actually tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work without mainly</font>

786
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:41,030
well I can use vlans this this this this

787
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,980
oh that doesn't work this clashes with

788
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:45,410
this customer over here trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

789
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,780
compatible vlan-id<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dicey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

790
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:49,670
quickly there's the slow provisioning

791
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:52,190
you know it takes weeks to turn this up

792
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:54,950
and weeks is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not acceptable or even days</font>

793
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,990
I want my peer of my out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course the</font>

794
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,360
coefficient thing is not slow well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

795
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,940
provided in a day but ok but it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

796
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">be in seconds is my opinion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it needs to</font>

797
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,870
be the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of provisioning that</font>

798
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,220
you get on a multi-point exchange you

799
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:10,489
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it it's there it's up it's</font>

800
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:12,470
passing traffic IRC leads to a DD this

801
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,440
is a well-known psychological phenomenon

802
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,810
yes we you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it done fast and</font>

803
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also there's I don't know about m6</font>

804
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:22,550
but there's fees associated with each

805
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:26,270
one of these and I i think a model that

806
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:28,280
didn't have these pervy LAN I don't

807
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,050
think start I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feature</font>

808
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:32,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit much for my see just operational</font>

809
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:34,159
people saying well I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to configure a</font>

810
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,590
VLAN tech I need to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> out my</font>

811
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:38,540
appearance for that I don't want to do

812
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,340
this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular surface it's a</font>

813
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,050
manual<font color="#E5E5E5"> process it's very limited it's</font>

814
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,399
that slow to provision and cost you

815
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,649
money I don't want to do it either you

816
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">know but if it's a platform that's built</font>

817
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:50,480
around this that negotiates the

818
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,640
interconnection IPS that negotiates the

819
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,800
these things and maybe you know gives me

820
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,050
cut and paste output into my router so

821
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,240
become a player and fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough if you</font>

822
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:02,149
already have a system<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you have to</font>

823
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,890
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this it might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be different thus less</font>

824
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">forties and search for Yvonne's decided</font>

825
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:08,420
that has to be provided by the i-x it

826
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:09,980
could be anything it could be the end

827
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point either in point could</font>

828
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,250
provide it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's value in</font>

829
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,040
cutting that out of the picture if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

830
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:17,389
look at what it takes to turn up a P&I

831
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,550
right now that's that's kind of a pain

832
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,710
send any male who wants to provide it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

833
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,120
I'll do it here it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and then you don't</font>

834
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain the other side's dns</font>

835
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:27,290
information but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it means says there's a</font>

836
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,350
user increase over IP space between you

837
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's not bad especially if</font>

838
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:34,429
you support 31 it's the same IP space

839
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,839
it's just as Nolan or coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of you</font>

840
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,029
know either party back and forth it's

841
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,720
now coming out of but you need to

842
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:44,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">stretch 31 / original circuit yeah also</font>

843
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:47,239
now now we have reports with three

844
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:49,279
hundreds beers with one I Pyramus yeah

845
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:51,469
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> this board needs to have 300 IP</font>

846
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">adolescence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's small increase in IDs</font>

847
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:55,850
but I mean people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do know it should be</font>

848
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,819
an ice cream or increase v6 fabric it

849
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:02,390
won't matter that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on v6 it would be</font>

850
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,950
a good buy for 46 let's go one of those

851
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:09,170
security issues you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this like sniff</font>

00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:10,490
traffic how do you luda<font color="#CCCCCC"> Toma the point</font>

853
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:14,240
was fundamentally that the platform

854
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:16,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">itself you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send someone packets</font>

855
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,890
where you pretend to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else's</font>

856
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,230
IP and pollute their art and have them

857
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,000
send traffic to you and yes if you're

858
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,620
running a well-run<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange where this</font>

859
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">is locked down to mac address you can</font>

860
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,279
work around these issues but

861
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,990
fundamentally the platform itself is

862
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,670
vulnerable to this and there's a lot of

863
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:34,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">morally run exchange points out there</font>

864
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:36,080
where who knows what's going on yeah

865
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's way different more difficult</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font>

server going on where everybody shares

870
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:55,820
the thing also has security issues it's

871
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,890
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> becoming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> immensely popular it's a</font>

874
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,149
what you said is like it's difficult to

875
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:10,430
get many networks to in exchange or we

876
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:13,070
get them<font color="#E5E5E5"> from far away from Asia from</font>

877
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:15,169
Eastern Europe these people don't speak

878
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:17,080
very good English so they happy to peer

879
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:19,370
with root server and they exchange

880
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:24,049
multiple gigabits of traffic with each

00:36:31,869 --> 00:36:36,460
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my head but I know that data I</font>

00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:40,569

886
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:43,150
go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero if the web servers is gone so</font>

887
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:44,829
it is it is in percentages I have

888
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,990
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> think ed ports with you and I</font>

889
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,910
will never touch the route server and I

890
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:50,379
can think of minutes that's a big of

891
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:51,970
many other members so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not zero I</font>

892
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,700
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of many other members who are</font>

894
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:59,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">course you can do this model together</font>

895
00:36:56,559 --> 00:37:00,760
which it shares yeah yeah you could

896
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement you know if people if there</font>

897
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,940
was a an MLP a where everyone wanted to

898
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,220
hear with everyone you could implement

899
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as one vpls service interconnect</font>

900
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:15,270
them all use a route server that's

901
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:18,460
certainly possible yeah another<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment</font>

902
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:21,599
you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go to 8000 okay so</font>

903
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:23,980
yeah this is last them through like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8000</font>

904
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:26,200
sites and stuff for 80 sides on a

905
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,780
thousand members and don't think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

906
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">all skill to that but our membership</font>

907
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:36,190
basically forbid us to do that we have

908
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:38,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">to stay in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam once we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of suggestion to go outside of</font>

910
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:43,650
Amsterdam he certainly had a full member

911
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:45,609
meeting with members actually

912
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,839
participating in the meeting and saying

913
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:48,490
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to do this because</font>

914
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:50,650
you're basically competing with our own

915
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">business we are the providers that give</font>

916
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,520
connections to other I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree with</font>

917
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,349
that what we were talking about is

918
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,910
within a metro area so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

919
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:00,220
consider a market like New York which

920
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:02,649
might have four or five large carrier

921
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:04,390
hotels and then has hundreds of other

922
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:07,270
buildings that there's existing layer

923
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">two networks that interconnect where you</font>

924
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,910
know you might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an office building</font>

925
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:12,250
down the street you might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy</font>

926
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:15,670
transit over this for multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> riders</font>

927
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,109
you might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take two locations</font>

928
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:19,900
to play a router use it as your

929
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:22,089
transport so it really opens up a wide

930
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,960
variety of services that you can't do

931
00:38:22,089 --> 00:38:25,029
one

932
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,200
additional exchange today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

933
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:32,530
even those surfaces are surfaces that

934
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,870
members 45 right now absolutely that

935
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,280
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new exchange point business</font>

936
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:38,140
model you're talking about long-haul

937
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,970
we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no I'm talking</font>

938
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,609
I'm hydro as well yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah but I mean</font>

939
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,680
yeah yes there are some members who

940
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,120
provide that but there's also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

941
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,440
members who sell transit and they would

942
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to sell transit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the more</font>

943
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,580
people in more places and I think that

944
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:54,250
probably outweighs their interest in

945
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,170
this if people really want a dedicated

946
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:59,200
wave or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't really good</font>

947
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:01,120
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that when people</font>

948
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,100
expressed interest in when people

949
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,319
expressed interest in this model one of

950
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:07,180
the things in cities like Amsterdam in

951
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,370
New York City's where people have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

952
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,109
lot of there's a lot of diversity

953
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:13,060
because there aren't massive buildings

954
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:14,830
that people have deployed into is the

955
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,810
challenge and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the</font>

956
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:18,970
provisioning to either extend your

957
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:20,590
backbone to all those locations or reach

958
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,600
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reach customers and so I think</font>

959
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,940
what Richard saying is people have said

960
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:26,230
if you can solve this problem for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we</font>

961
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,490
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care that you're competing</font>

962
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,860
with Metro transport because

963
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">fundamentally where a consumer of Metro</font>

964
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,400
transport for getting to our customers

965
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,970
provisioning our backbone or

966
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:39,610
provisioning those access leaves yeah

967
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,350
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you um I think if there are no</font>

more brickbats or lightning bolts from

969

the audience yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can flame them at</font>
