59
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:10,640
the elusive<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network experiment policy</font>

60
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:12,800
finally got agreement the changes

61
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,260
suggested from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> community and worked</font>

62
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,780
out with with merit and it should be

63
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:22,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">posted on the site it is yeah all right</font>

64
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,440
good so the key things being that any

65
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,690
network experiment participation is

66
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">voluntary by nanog attendees it's not</font>

67
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:33,190
going to be foisted on anybody data will

68
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">be shared and was the other key thing I</font>

69
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,480
think those are the two important ones

70
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:40,820
it was they were like oh yeah yeah yeahs

71
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,010

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,290
colleagues in terms of network behavior

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,860
and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something interesting to do</font>

81
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:09,230
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reasonable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

and the recipients have been gaining

92
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:48,710
value we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider how we put how</font>

93
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,850
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be putting more funding into</font>

94
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:58,840
the pot expect to hear more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

95

ratified by the SC and we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

99
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:14,060
the funding elements and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

100
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:17,450
as an outreach for educational

important for this meeting right at the

top their nominations at<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not going</font>

121
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:15,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">to read off the rest because I think you</font>

122
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:21,989
all can read Dave

123
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:27,510
I hope I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any slides oh ok I</font>

124
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:29,520
do sorry um well I thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

125
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,810
and I'm on the plane today because I was

126
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,049
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make these slides and I decided</font>

127
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:37,440
not to mostly because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say a</font>

128
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:38,910
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> things one is i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean i could give</font>

129
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,850
you guys all the statistics it's pretty

130
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,460
dull we got 47 talks we accepted eighty

131
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,760
percent of them that's it but what's

132
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,229
really more important is that if you're

133
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,930
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net from the program community</font>

134
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,240
perspective if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> submit a</font>

135
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,220
talk one of the big problems we have is

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,620
people submit really great ideas but

137
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,150
they never give us any slides or even

138
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,290
outline slides so we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard time</font>

139
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:06,450
deciding whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can accept</font>

140
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:09,600
things and sometimes that goes wrong so

141
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,940
if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to propose to talk or or</font>

142
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,010
you know people here proposing talks

143
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,580
what you really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would really be</font>

144
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,810
helpful to us is if he got slides to us

145
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,120
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you any statistics</font>

146
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,150
because as I said it's really built the

147
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,250
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to say was um if</font>

148
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,750
you know people who would be good for

149
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,610
the PC because a lot of people are

150
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:32,130
rotating off the pc i think half roughly

151
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,350
half I mean some are timing out some are

152
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:37,140
not reopen so roughly half so it's going

153
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:39,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a big turnover so the composition</font>

154
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:42,840
of the pc is going to change radically

155
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:46,460
so if you know people who would be good

156
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,830
as just that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the pc or that have</font>

157
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:51,719
kind of a sort of a vision about what

158
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,280
now it could be or should be and could

159
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,640
be on the pc that would be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful</font>

160
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,669
the thing is is that you know it it does

161
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,550
take some commitment and you know people

162
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:04,200
should know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but um those</font>

163
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,250
those were the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> things i wanted to</font>

164
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,820
say i don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take up a lot of</font>

165
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,410
time but i did want to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me say</font>

166
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,040
one other thing too is that we have this

167
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:16,590
process where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get the talks and then</font>

168
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,450
we all rate them and then we rate you

169
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,789
know based on the input that we get

170
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:23,219
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally slides and this is</font>

171
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:27,230
the not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing becomes</font>

172
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,910
difficult but we we rate them and so we

173
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:32,729
a select them based on what information

174
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,410
we have and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes what happens is</font>

175
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:36,960
and this has happened this time in

176
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:39,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get in from we get</font>

177
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,940
like slides or updated slides very late

178
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,280
and it makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult for us to</font>

179
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:47,070
select talks that maybe we think would

180
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:49,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">be good so get bigger get your stuff in</font>

181
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:51,180
early and then the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I wanted</font>

182
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just say because I want to I want</font>

183
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:56,520
everybody to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the social</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> event is</font>

184
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,260
you know do people have questions for

185
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:01,680
the program committee how it operates

186
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,800
what it ought to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing again in the</font>

187
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,050
in the kind of sentiment that this is

188
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,030
your meeting that we should things that

189
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,819
we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be looking at things that we</font>

190
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:14,339
could do to make the meeting better

191
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:18,120
anybody have anything like that go like

192
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:20,360
this if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do or you go to the one of</font>

193
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,360
the mics

194
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,509
oh by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking at you</font>

195
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:29,339
thanks but i was looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> joe's slide</font>

196
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:32,339
about the mailing lists i can't post

197
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:35,399
most of those myself so you know so you

198
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:38,279
had said that you had submissions that

199
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,990
weren't complete but looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they</font>

200
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,240
were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be good talks why not move</font>

201
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,800
those to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightning talks that's what</font>

202
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,809
we try to do that's you know that's

203
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,790
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we try to do in fact it</font>

204
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:49,319
turned out it's an excellent point in

205
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,639
fact what turned out was a lot of the

206
00:09:49,319 --> 00:09:53,550
lightning talks would have been nice for

207
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,230
general session you know but fortunately

208
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,300
we have the space in lightning talks to

209
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,889
accommodate them because the reality is

210
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,490
at some point we have to we have to have

211
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:04,319
someone agenda and the lightning<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks</font>

212
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:10,290
give us flexibility to kind of do

213
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:15,300
exactly what you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> Louis hey hey</font>

214
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:18,209
Louie<font color="#CCCCCC"> um of the people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> submitted</font>

215
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:21,899
the good topics and but then submit the

216
00:10:18,209 --> 00:10:23,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides if I were them I might not want</font>

217
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,439
to work on a nice big set of slices

218
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,809
without knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my talk is going to</font>

219
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:31,170
get accepted<font color="#E5E5E5"> so did y'all at least ask</font>

220
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:33,750
them for the outline yeah we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

221
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:35,459
do but you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a varying</font>

222
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:37,470
degree you know you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many talks</font>

223
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,239
you'd given right so you give the

224
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,920
minimum amount of you do the minimum

225
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,199
amount of work you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do at least I do</font>

226
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,349
you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

227
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:48,269
do and and you know sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

228
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,980
saying is sometimes if you just did a

229
00:10:48,269 --> 00:10:51,980
little bit more it would help us out oh

230
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:58,110
no I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question for men is a</font>

231
00:10:56,009 --> 00:11:00,990
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> or a question this is a comment</font>

232
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,939
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question so since we get topics</font>

233
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:04,439
that are very very similar and if we

234
00:11:02,939 --> 00:11:06,480
only have an abstract it's very

235
00:11:04,439 --> 00:11:08,730
difficult to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we could ask</font>

236
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,129
that both parties to work together and

237
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,990
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> combine or one party to take the</font>

238
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,910
lead in the other party to contribute on

239
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:17,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the back end this is why the slides are</font>

240
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:23,420
really key abstracts are great but

241
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:27,420
they're rather abstract what she said

242
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:29,139
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just add who are you by</font>

243
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,649
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm tired under it</font>

244
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:36,429
I'm a near-future former program

245
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:39,220
committee member um and I think for

246
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:42,670
context I'll add this is a standoff

247
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,350
right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a typically it is really</font>

248
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,959
good presenters playing chicken with the

249
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,910
program committee and like we all lose

250
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,378
at that but typically people like I

251
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:51,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do the slides unless I'm</font>

252
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:53,470
going to get the talk accepted we're

253
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,498
like I haven't going to accept the talk

254
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,239
unless you do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides so typically if</font>

255
00:11:56,499 --> 00:12:01,269
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> program committee says</font>

256
00:11:58,239 --> 00:12:03,489
this is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good talk idea a lot of</font>

257
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are interested in it please do</font>

258
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:07,540
some slides but we can't commit to

259
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:09,429
accepting it what that means is if you

260
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,049
do the slides unless you're a complete

261
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,549
doofus your talk will probably be

262
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:15,160
accepted and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should just do this</font>

263
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:16,899
lot so the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing I'll come in</font>

264
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,699
is that frequently people will do slides

265
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:21,429
that don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any appreciable</font>

266
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:22,809
narrative at all to them aside from the

267
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:24,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">one that's in the person's head which</font>

268
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,379
doesn't mean it's not going to be a good

269
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,899
talk it could be a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk but if</font>

270
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,910
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in the slides if the narrative</font>

271
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:32,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the story isn't in the slides there's</font>

272
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,629
no way somebody who doesn't know you and

273
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:36,939
hasn't seen the talk given<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can judge</font>

274
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:38,919
the slide so try to get some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of i</font>

275
00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:40,809
am going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this it will be</font>

276
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,429
about this here are six subjects look<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

277
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:44,230
have covered the six subjects there's

278
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,610
five pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to come I'll throw</font>

279
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,989
that in later<font color="#E5E5E5"> which because it's hard</font>

280
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,350
work and I don't want to do it after

281
00:12:46,989 --> 00:12:52,569
that's fine like leaving specific slides

282
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,980
empty but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not fine to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm</font>

283
00:12:52,569 --> 00:12:57,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to talk about this please accept</font>

284
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,139
my time oh and yet so the other thing to

285
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:01,689
remember is that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the noun</font>

286
00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:03,040
archives are hugely important<font color="#E5E5E5"> in tons of</font>

287
00:13:01,689 --> 00:13:05,469
people spend a lot of time in the

and so make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your presentation</font>

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,180
folks like Steve Feldman who are now

319
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,680
the Merrick participants were the ones

who've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> around since the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new charter</font>

321
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,388
was created so we have the institutional

00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:56,800
memory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the rest of the</font>

323
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:59,199
community you should have that so been

00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,540
around from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inception and the new</font>

charter to the present the pc internal

326
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:11,189
process is fairly ad-hoc we do things on

327
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:16,389
a consensus basis but it's not arbitrary

328
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:18,550
that is we do rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on precedent there's</font>

329
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:21,430
been demonstrated to be willingness on

330
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,740
the part of participants in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC to</font>

331
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,329
alter the division of labor so just

332
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,800
because somebody did something in the

333
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:31,599
past doesn't mean they'll do it in the

334
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,758
future we're responsive to SC input or

335
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,069
at least we have been but we're not

336
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">beholding to them in theory they can</font>

337
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:40,599
replace us unlike with the mlc we've

338
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,949
never actually managed to escalate

339
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,589
something to the point where it became a

340
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:50,290
crisis in some respects I'm actually

341
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:55,240
disappointed by that but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

342
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:58,000
are the way they are so one of the

343
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,550
things that came out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> new charter</font>

344
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,139
and the way that the SC works in the way

345
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program committee works was an</font>

346
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:07,959
increased effort at transparency so this

347
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:11,649
results in minutes from our meetings

348
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:13,569
which don't discuss the merits of the

349
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:15,639
individual presentations but do discuss

350
00:16:13,569 --> 00:16:18,099
the themes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the program</font>

351
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:19,240
committee is interested in the issues

352
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:21,610
that we've raised with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the steering</font>

353
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee and things that were thinking</font>

354
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:26,949
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> for future program elements so</font>

355
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:30,300
those don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get read by too many people</font>

356
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:35,949
except Martin Hannigan but

357
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:39,359
you know they are out there obviously

358
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:42,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are a few points of friction</font>

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,320
Martin Martin<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hanigan internet golf</font>

362
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:58,989

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,810
points<font color="#E5E5E5"> of friction for the most part the</font>

364
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:04,329
pc is a relatively well oiled machine

365
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:07,659
but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it runs over stuff or</font>

366
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:11,260
breaks things so one of the things that

367
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,760
came out of the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new charter</font>

368
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:18,609
process was the practical requirements

369
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:20,740
driven by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community earlier</font>

370
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:23,260
availability of the agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

371
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,150
you have the agenda earlier you can go

00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,089
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your bosses earlier and request</font>

373
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:31,110
travel you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plans earlier and so</font>

374
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:34,110
on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cfp is earlier</font>

375
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:37,330
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the meeting in fact and</font>

ability to respond to industry events

00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:42,129
that is things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen between the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">two meetings we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really scramble</font>

379

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,590
the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> is only out to three weeks</font>

luxury of actually altering it right up

383
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,178
to the date where we put a stamp on it

384
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:59,740
and called it good so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually took</font>

385
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:01,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">a considerable amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effort that</font>

386
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,059
means speeding up all of our processes

387
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,840
it means hounding you folks to make sure

388
00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:11,110
that you get your talks in early and it

389
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,370
means reduced flexibility so there are

390
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely trade-offs associated with</font>

391
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:22,270
getting this process out earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've been pretty successful and I don't</font>

393
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,650
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the quality of the program</font>

394
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:29,559
has suffered as a result in fact I mean

395
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:32,590
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we made very serious efforts to</font>

396
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:36,100
avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that programming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of joint</font>

397
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:37,990
activities the program committee oddly

398
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,049
enough thinks of itself as controlling

399
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,350
the program and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

400
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:48,049
experiments

401

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,789
meetings outside North America obviously

404
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,490
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> closely with the</font>

407
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:08,929
of hard to work with um not sure why

408
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:10,760
that is but they run their meetings in a

409
00:19:08,929 --> 00:19:13,039
certain way and we run ours in a certain

410
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,408
way and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have significant</font>

411
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,220
challenges there so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Future program</font>

412
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:23,690
committee gets to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that event</font>

413
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:25,159
good luck distribution of ownership of

414
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:27,440
repeating program elements and

415
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:29,750
increasing depth of the bench so one of

416
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,570
the complaints<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when I was early on</font>

417
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:34,669
the program was named people were

00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,399
responsible for the same things all the

time and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't like Bill</font>

Norton I love his jokes but I think the

421

peering buff is much more successful now

422
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:49,460
because it has multiple people involved

the program pune has been very

433
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:15,470
interested in so big winds lightning

434
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,770
talks everybody loves those the big

435
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:20,720
secret is is they also allow us to move

436
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:23,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">program elements around because they're</font>

437
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,280
not pre-scheduled so that means we get

438
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:28,190
the agenda early out with items on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

439
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,539
and we can still tweak it up to the last

440
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:35,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">minute the peering track I think I like</font>

441
00:20:32,539 --> 00:20:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the new format I think lots of other</font>

442
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,289
people do too i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little bit</font>

443
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:41,120
more inclusive than it used to be

444
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:44,360
newcomers Ren was really the champion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

445
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,570
this in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> she paid for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Comcast</font>

446
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,168
did but but Ren actually made the

447
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,119
newcomers work the first two times and

448
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:56,499
now it's become an institution so that

449
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:58,480
was a serious wind for this this program

450
00:20:56,499 --> 00:21:01,659
committee and I think the program

451
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,960
quality has gotten better and I don't

452
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:07,389
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's necessarily to cast doubt</font>

453
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,359
on the abilities of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous program</font>

454
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:13,389
committees but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really tried pretty</font>

455
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:17,080
hard on this and it was a serious

456
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:32,439
element of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were trying to</font>

457
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:35,830
produce so thanks thanks Joe all right

465
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,619
actively participate in the mailing list

466
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:10,239
committee would acts as a resource for

467
00:22:05,619 --> 00:22:12,039
us Simon is out New Zealand so he

468

the last meeting the major update to the

00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:27,249
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list committee was the</font>

472
00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:30,009
publication of our thread moderation

473
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:33,609
policy this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

474
00:22:30,009 --> 00:22:36,129

475
00:22:33,609 --> 00:22:38,590
use and I think we've been fairly

476
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:41,259
successful at it but you can read the

477
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,809
policy at the URL there and if you have

478
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:46,419
feedback on any of the policies please

479
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:50,350
bring them up on nanog futures futures

480
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:54,369
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty quiet lately since the</font>

481
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:57,969
last meeting not much has changed we've

482
00:22:54,369 --> 00:23:00,600
been very light handed we've relied on

483
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:04,570
thread moderation policy rather than

484
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,668
poking at individual people especially

485
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,240
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> threats get completely out of</font>

486
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:12,850
control September numbers were actually

487
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,080
higher i got them just shortly after the

488
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:20,110
slides were put together we're at 10,000

489
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:24,309
448 subscribers so it's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

490
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:26,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">on there it's growing the number of</font>

491
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:30,970
posts actually went down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in September</font>

492
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:31,990
651 so the level of post hasn't really

493
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:33,639
changed but the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of subscribers</font>

494
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:35,889
has increased so it's just something

495
00:23:33,639 --> 00:23:37,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to keep in mind we're</font>

496
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:43,629
reaching a fairly large audience when

497
00:23:37,809 --> 00:23:45,428
posting we have two seats for sure

498
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:47,439
opening up on the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> committee</font>

499
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:48,909
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for people to get</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">involved I think there's some</font>

interesting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be coming</font>

505
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:04,059
interested in those of you that don't

508
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:12,940
section where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask why you don't use</font>

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> or any comments on it can you give me</font>

510
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:19,110
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of feedback we can probably do</font>

511
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:22,120
some things to make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> better for you</font>

512
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:25,870
that's all the things I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>
