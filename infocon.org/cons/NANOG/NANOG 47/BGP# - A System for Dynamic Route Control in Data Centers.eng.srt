tenants they have many different goals

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,619
but in allow their goals they ultimately

42
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,840
want to be able to control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ralphs</font>

time the landlord who manages to share

45
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:46,920
infrastructure they want to make sure

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they can involve the user but also</font>

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,700
at the same time control any bad

behavior that 10 mi have and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensure this</font>

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">is in the scalable so example of a</font>

50
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,090
tenant goal is to spirit traffic so here

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,009
you have an incoming traffic going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

52
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:00,870
router and you'll go to spread the

53
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,870
traffic between two servers and

54
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,200
the 192 that wants to take da 0 2 and 3

55
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a second goal is to migrate traffic</font>

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,440
so instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> spreading it you want to</font>

57
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,980
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic from one server to</font>

58
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:17,430
another so currently the way you perform

59
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,440
these changes is as follows first<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

60
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,400
tendon would submit a ticket to

61
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,460
something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ticket distribution</font>

62
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,550
system and the system will assign a

63
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:28,200
dedicated admin to the ticket then the

64
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:30,120
admin<font color="#CCCCCC"> will clarify the requirement in</font>

65
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,820
the ticket<font color="#E5E5E5"> tenon which requires several</font>

66
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,980
rounds of communication back and forth

67
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:36,630
once the requirement is clarified the

68
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:41,070
admin creates a real configuration for

69
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:43,260
the ticket and again the admin will show

70
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:45,150
the tenant Iran policy to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

71
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,880
the wrong policy satisfied the

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:49,890
requirement ticket which will<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be</font>

73
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:53,790
will also likely be several rounds of

74
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,769
discussion as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and once the the</font>

76

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ticket disrepute the ticket</font>

79
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,410
distribution system and finally the 10

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,530
is notified that the tickets<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve and</font>

81
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,720
the buff process is<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a supply and</font>

82
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,720
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are three major problems in this</font>

83
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,459
in the sword framework first tenants<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

84
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,890
have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of routing the</font>

85
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,050
only thing they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to specify</font>

86
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,720
requirements that they want in a ticket

87
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,340
in the system where you ticket my

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,590
property over several ticket

89
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:32,100
distribution system the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement</font>

90
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,140
might have lost its translation along

91
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:36,480
the way and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> second problems a</font>

92
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,170
there's a dedicated human resource

93
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,310
required for its ticketed and lastly

94
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,950
there's a lot of manual configuration on

95
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,440
the part of the network admin and as

96
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,829
such the ticket resolution time<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

97
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,959
might very long so based on these

98
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,390
problems it would be nice to have a good

99
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,810
system to deal with this and the system

100
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:59,010
should have the following<font color="#E5E5E5"> properties</font>

101
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,570
first it should allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some sort of</font>

102
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,030
automated rail control through the use

103
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,489
of application application programming

104
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,320
interface and second issue a lot of

105
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,780
tenants independent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say bro control</font>

106
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,680
and the same time validate any requests

107
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,280
that the tens

108
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,798
have and third it should ensure better

109
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,959
scalability at two levels the first

110
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">level is system scalability by factoring</font>

111
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,979
out policy control and this in the

112
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,110
second level<font color="#E5E5E5"> is human resource by</font>

113
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,360
eliminating the need for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dedicated</font>

114
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">atom per ticket and lastly you should</font>

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,680
tolerate failures and point mittens

116
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,250
through deployment of redundant

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,080
components so the solution that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

118
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">suggested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is called PG be sharp and it</font>

119
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,400
contains three components the first

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,979
component<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a simple speaker which I'll</font>

121
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,679
refer to as multi speaker<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now on it</font>

122
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:48,330
Pierce with<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP rollers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in it it just</font>

123
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">sends route announcements in with</font>

124
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,460
drawers and when a single multi speaker

125
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:56,370
instance is able to set up multiple

126
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,520
pyramid sessions with the router so it's

127
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,590
able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CMP and the second</font>

128
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">component is a staple controller</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

129
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,729
from now on<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll refer to as controller</font>

130
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,580
it controls and coordinates the speakers

131
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:11,580
in exposes a public<font color="#E5E5E5"> API to tenants and</font>

132
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,229
the last part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the tenant calling</font>

133
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,599
application which I'll refer to as

134
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,460
application from now on it discovers the

135
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,590
services offered by the controller's API

136
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,669

138
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,780
architecture looks something<font color="#E5E5E5"> as follows</font>

multiple multi speakers connected to the

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,190
controller finally have an exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> API</font>

146
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:46,080
to each of the tenants application so

147
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,539
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how we can use this</font>

148
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,669
architecture to to solve the tenant

149
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,229
golsat previously mentioned for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

150
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:54,960
first example I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

151
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:57,270
migrating traffic so while do here is

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,530
that that the application from tenant

153
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,198
will issue a rail change request

154
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,359
something like move the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop from</font>

155
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,009
one server to another and then the

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,229
controller will actually validate and

157
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:09,389
for that requests when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets to the</font>

158
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:12,060
speaker the speaker transforms are

159
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,440
requesting 3gp messages and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and send it</font>

160
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router so the router will update</font>

161
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,190
its routing table so in this case you

162
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,260
move the traffic from 10 2016 8 0<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 3 2</font>

163
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:25,210
192 168 0 0 2

164
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,710
but there's a caveat the multi speaker

165
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,049
needs to would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> and announce the</font>

167
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:35,320

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">spread traffic and here the setup is as</font>

178
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,510
and the controller will validate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

179
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:03,550
that requests to the multi speaker and

the multi speaker will use the

additional the second pyramid session to

182

automatically manage routes to meet the

of rock control program that can satisfy

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,690
a certain goal so for example if you

00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:52,900
example if you want high throughput you

would look something like the red box on

217
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,890
the left where you have a list of

24 the controller wouldn't honor that

225
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:48,880
because the tenant is not allowed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kenna 8 it's not all to do so and in</font>

237
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,719

policy controller per machine and he

239
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,110
also reduces the number of pyramid

242
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,829
these I need a custom routing to to have

243
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:29,350
a PT session to the router and to to

244

for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dedicated admin / ticketed by</font>

247
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,370
ensuring that the policies in force at

248
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,220
the controller so there's only a few

249
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,959
admins needed to configure the policy at

250
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:47,440
a controller for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all day folder cannons</font>

251

253
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:56,500
others the next points resiliency and

254
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,720
the BG recharge system strives to

255
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,060
achieve to type of resiliency one first

256
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,470
is called system resiliency and this is

257
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,709
to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system continuous</font>

258
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,230
operating even when any any single

259
00:10:05,709 --> 00:10:10,510
component system<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fail and BTW shopper</font>

260
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,550
achieve that through<font color="#CCCCCC"> two means first is</font>

261
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:15,550
to instantiate multiple multi speakers

262
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:18,099
so that a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> single multi speaker</font>

263
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:20,410
failure does not affect other multi

264
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,089
speakers availability and the second

265
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,219
point is to separate the multi speaker

266
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,560
in the controller so when controller

267
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,070
fails the multi speaker is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> affected</font>

268
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,930
and to ensure prefix resiliency meaning

269
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:34,089
we want to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prefix</font>

270
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:36,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">states available even when components my</font>

271
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:39,940
fail there's also two methods the first

272
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,279
method is announced the same prefix for

273
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,620
multiple multi speakers so when a single

274
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,149
multi speaker fails the prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

275
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,850
still be available in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router from</font>

276
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,990
the other multi speakers and second is

277
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,029
also too

278
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:54,310
the mostly speaker in the controller so

279
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:56,950
when the controller<font color="#E5E5E5"> fails the prefix is</font>

280
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,359
not affected in the following a couple

281
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,480
of slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give an example</font>

282
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:03,490
for a prefix resiliency and instead as

283
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,459
follows I have a router at the top and

284
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">two multi speaker speaker a and B that</font>

285
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:10,959
have a period session established with

286
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,599

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,619
the bulk both multi speaker's announced

288
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,570
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SAS 32 prefixes viv won't</font>

289
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:21,600
give two to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relative and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the router</font>

290
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:25,420
installed saying the routing table and

291
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,920
now suppose multi speaker be fills the

292
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit boring bib to from multi speaker</font>

293
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,260
beads removed but the VIP wine VIP<font color="#E5E5E5"> 24</font>

294
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:33,969
multi speaker a is still there since<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

295
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:36,670
session is still there so the end result

296
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:39,760
is a VIP wine bit too is still available

297
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can have some kind of</font>

298
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,420
automation service that that's over

299
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,359
overarching manager of the data center

300
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,860
to instantiate a new a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance of</font>

301
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,160
multi speaker let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it multi</font>

302
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,410
speaker see and have the controller pull

303
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:58,380
a configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a persistent store</font>

304
00:11:53,410 --> 00:12:00,640
to restore the prefix redundancies in

305
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,700
next let's pose that the controller

306
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,230
fails in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case multi speaker aim and</font>

307
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,980
see their appearance session the router

308
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:11,440
is still there so so both the point 2

309
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,260
from both speakers are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so</font>

310
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,690
the prefix availability is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> affected</font>

311
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,060
and also we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the elevation</font>

312
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:23,260
servers instantiate a new instance of

313
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:26,739
the controller so with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this multi</font>

314
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:28,270
speaker setup we we thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

315
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:31,870
is there any problem with inconsistency

316
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,670
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consider the first the first</font>

317
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">scenario where some multi speaker become</font>

319
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,890
sends a force a request to add or draw

00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,739
certain rels how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know is is</font>

321
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:47,589
actually read wrong or or install into

322
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,300
the router the way of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way we</font>

323
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:52,480
overcome that problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a BGP</font>

324
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,569
listening to that listens for robbery

325
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,160
advertisement so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we receive a robbery</font>

presentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have like demo but it's</font>

370
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:57,010
yeah I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been thinking that</font>

371
00:14:51,170 --> 00:15:00,260
this is some yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Paul Francis that</font>

p-gp seems like a pretty coarse grain

374
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,240
not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know something like mpls with</font>

375
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:13,070
traffic engineering or something to

376
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:15,170
really set up the flows so the reason

377
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:17,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the main reason that motivates to</font>

378
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:19,790
use bgp in the first place was when we

379
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,970
look at several different routing

380
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:25,610
protocols like ospf is is in BGP we

381
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:27,800
realized that the BGP finite state

382
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,800
machine is is fairly simple in yourself

383
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:33,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's only several states and the</font>

384
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">message that we need to to construct a</font>

385
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,270
very small but the only the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest part</font>

386
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,120
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to configure is the update</font>

387
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:44,810
messages and also at the same time the

388
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,480
BGP allows us to to have policy

389
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:50,329
filtering on the router and and just

390
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,860
considering all those we pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP but we</font>

391
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:57,910
didn't look too much into mpls so so

392
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,910
yeah so that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

393
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:15,160
in their questions all right thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

394
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much if there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no more questions</font>
