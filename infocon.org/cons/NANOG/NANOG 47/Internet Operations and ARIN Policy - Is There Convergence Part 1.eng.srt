1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:08,130
so all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you so the internet</font>

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,809
is changing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we saw this a lot</font>

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">with Craig's talk in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet could be</font>

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,678
changing a lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next couple of</font>

years and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that's going</font>

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:22,160
to be impactful is the convergence or

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:25,260
the oncoming run out of v4 addresses and

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,080
where does v6 play into that role and

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,199
where does v4 play in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that role and a</font>

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,070
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this has to deal with policy and</font>

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron is here and I'm the CTO of Aaron</font>

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,559
by the way more<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers and one thing</font>

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,850
the things that we wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is go</font>

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">through some of these things that are</font>

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,870
that are being discussed within the

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,620
errant community of which many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,718
are apart but actually have some very

18
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,879
interesting sort of operational impacts

19
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,539
and some of them were seen today for

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:00,000
example for<font color="#E5E5E5"> by TSS we ourselves that</font>

21
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:02,430
Aaron have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 4-byte asn our West Coast</font>

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,110
Colo<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're willing to peer with</font>

23
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,710
anyone and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing how many people</font>

24
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,630
cannot at this point they come to us and

25
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,520
say hey we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to peer with you and we</font>

26
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,869
say okay we got four byte is and they

27
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,729
say oh we can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

28
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,009
kind of a problem because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're running</font>

29
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of that as well there's also who is</font>

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:25,890
clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up who is information trying to</font>

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,490
make it make it a little bit more robust

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,159
and reliable and consistent v6 policies

33
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,110
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and relax transfer</font>

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,329
policies and etc all these things

35
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:41,520
actually have a large impact on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

36
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:43,860
operational a community and one of the

37
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,450
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we found is talking to</font>

38
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,229
people it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing how many people</font>

39
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,360
really don't understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> or know some of</font>

40
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,200
these looming sort of events are coming

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,329
up on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the horizon and the time to</font>

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,049
actually make it sort of easy landing

43
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:04,079
for these events<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before run out is</font>

44
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:06,990
is now so that we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go</font>

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">through any sort of pain and one of the</font>

46
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,269
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of useful to know is</font>

47
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:13,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">that Aaron's is a membership-based</font>

48
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,780
organization

49
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,120
and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really you as a community who</font>

50
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,250
makes the policies and if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

51
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,760
the policies I you have the opportunity

52
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,160
to change those and to that end<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

53
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">a Aaron meeting that's right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adjacent</font>

59
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,540
night where we're going to be talking

60
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,369
about policies and i believe it's

61
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,690
starting at six six to seven and usually

62
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">people get really hungry after that</font>

63
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,260
least<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be free</font>

64

pizza and beer after that as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

65
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,100

70
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:10,170
actually hopefully have you can have

71
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,880
some positive impact there so what we're

72
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,709
going to do is we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have we</font>

73
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,180
have two 30-minute sessions and we're

74
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,630
going to break between the first section

75
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we have esteemed panelists election</font>

76
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,810
here of five panels each panelist is

77
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,890
going to have five minutes to speak or

78
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:27,150
four minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> excuse me to speak about</font>

79
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">two things the first one is relaxed</font>

80
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,870
transfer policy and the second one is v6

81
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:37,920
policies the panelists are Tom Daley

82
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:43,140
there he is Daniel Alexander Igor Kevin

83
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:45,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">and Aaron Hughes so what we first like</font>

84
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:48,570
to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the relaxed transfer</font>

85
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,100
policy in RFC 2050 and and I was one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

86
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,630
the co-authors to that long time ago we

87
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,120
had a discussion about whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we</font>

88
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:56,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">should allow the ability for people to</font>

89
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,260
actually pay for address space and be

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,060
able to transfer from Party to party and

91
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,700
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point I said no way we just</font>

92
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,790
cannot do that as just it a crate

93
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,859
unfairness and things are<font color="#CCCCCC"> starting to</font>

94
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">change that way especially with v4 run</font>

95
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,500
out in the there's this thing called an

96
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,900
urban or it's a it's it's it's

97
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,140
affectionately known as and it's a

98
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,989
basically as Aaron's policy manual and

99
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:24,090
this policy manual again is actually put

100
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,370
together by you guys and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

101
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:29,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">where aaron has organization we actually</font>

102
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,860
implement those policies and one section

103
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this 8.3 has come from a policy</font>

104
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,600
proposal 2009 dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> one which in itself</font>

105
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,550
was somewhat controversial but it allows

106
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,790
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transfer of internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resources</font>

107
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,710
to operate or congested justify and this

108
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,979
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of mergers and acquisitions</font>

109
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,599
which was there before<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this brings up</font>

110
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:50,729
the question of whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not this is</font>

111
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,800
is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slippery slope to a</font>

112
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:55,260
market-based economy for address space

113
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,690
and so each of the panelists has their

114
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,789
own sort of views on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I like</font>

115
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,460
them to start coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up one by one here</font>

116
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,110
and talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these things and after</font>

117
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,669
that's finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have whatever time</font>

118
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:08,700
is remaining for questions and answers

119
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:11,580
so I look forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hearing from you</font>

120
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,409
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's go ahead and first start</font>

121
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,409
out with Tom

122
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:28,590
come on<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here too huh and I</font>

123
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:37,318
obviously not windows windows it's hard

124
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,270
so the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I work for is</font>

125
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,600
dynamic network services where a managed

126
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,840
external dns provider and so this policy

127
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,390
we took a look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and and spent</font>

128
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,479
quite a bit of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> deciphering exactly</font>

129
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:04,960
what eight dot three added to it and it

130
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:07,690
took you know myself and an attorney and

131
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,340
a couple business guys to look at this

132
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,410
and understand what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

133
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,090
really the key thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind</font>

134
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,960
here is Mark said is that it really

135
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:20,140
removes the M&A requirement for address

136
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,229
transfers it keeps the requirement for

137
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:25,419
justification so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really just</font>

138
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:28,870
allow any arbitrary transfer it allows a

139
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:30,880
justified transfer it keeps<font color="#CCCCCC"> our n in the</font>

140
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:34,990
middle of the process as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transfer</font>

141
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">agent but you know you have to ask your</font>

142
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:40,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">question ask yourself the question of</font>

143
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:44,050
does this create a market for<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray space</font>

144
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:46,540
if you will so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a 24 and i</font>

145
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:49,930
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for clean operations and you know</font>

146
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,750
you get a 24 that's poison space it's on

147
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">rbl zits on black lists and you know</font>

148
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,780
maybe let's just trade that space and

149
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:59,410
you'll give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money to trade that</font>

150
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:01,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">space you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this allow the</font>

bad bodies on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net to start doing in</font>

152
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,130
terms of moving their their assets

153
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:08,229
around in what space they may be routing

154
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">their their badness from is an</font>

155
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:13,890
interesting factor here and then the

156
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:16,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">other thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is is you can justify</font>

157
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,060
receiving space under this policy based

158
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:21,250
upon need but it may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a subset</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

159
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:22,540
space that's available for transfer so

160
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,400
that brings the question you know what

161
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:28,240
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregation and rib size</font>

162
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,950
upon transfer you know and then over

163
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">time you know if we kind of keep going</font>

164
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,030
down this path we wonder does<font color="#E5E5E5"> does some</font>

165
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,460
entity possibly air and suddenly become

166
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,440
a title agency for for address space and

167
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,760
is that a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> business opportunity for</font>

168
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">air</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something they want to get</font>

169
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,020
into or is or do we get into the concept

170
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:47,050
of a company just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like when you buy a</font>

171
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,280
house does a title search on the

172
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,640
property and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's not</font>

173
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,619
encumbered does the same thing happen to

174
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,539
address space and then does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it create</font>

175
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">precedents</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for further easing on</font>

176
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,990
policy and if that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> true the policy</font>

177
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:05,380
gets you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> East out do things like</font>

178
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,910
rpki and<font color="#CCCCCC"> si dr become impossible because</font>

179
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,320
we don't really know who owns the space

180
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:13,000
anymore does it detract on what the

181
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">aaron team has been doing for for who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,630
cleanup efforts so these are kind of the

183
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:22,450
questions we have around this relaxed

184
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:25,290
transfer policy yeah and that's it ok

185
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,289
Igor you're up next

186
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:48,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">amigurumi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> principal architect with yahoo</font>

187
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:50,160
so like Mark said<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively the policy</font>

188
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,679
allows for paid transfers of ipv4 space

189
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,059
provided the receiving party qualifies

190
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:57,839
for that space with aaron in the first

191
00:08:54,059 --> 00:09:00,299
place it doesn't relax the requirements

192
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,959
it just makes it easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> or makes it</font>

193
00:09:00,299 --> 00:09:06,239
possible to get space once it's runs up

194
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,969
so is this a good thing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion</font>

195
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:10,649
yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people can continue</font>

196
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:11,999
operating their business and grow in

197
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:15,720
their business without worrying about

198
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:17,879
running into a brick whole wall in 2012

199
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,879
or whatnot and can't get any more IP

200
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:22,619
space oh yes it makes it more expensive

201
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,419
to operate your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business come around</font>

202
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:27,359
that time but it makes it possible to

203
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:29,339
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing so it also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> puts a very</font>

204
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:32,759
clear financial implications and

205
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:36,089
incentive on ipv4 to ipv6 migration it

206
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:37,639
lets you plan what to do lets you plan

207
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,619
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less how much it's going to cost</font>

208
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:42,360
it also looks human lets you make pretty

209
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:46,230
smart business decisions on whether you

210
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,600
want to continue using ipv4 as you have

211
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:51,179
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past or if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font>

212
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,449
migrating from<font color="#E5E5E5"> v40 v6 and being able to</font>

213
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:58,049

others<font color="#E5E5E5"> help a couple of examples here I</font>

215
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:02,069
know some entities that will take them

<font color="#E5E5E5">two days to free up a / 16 ortho address</font>

217
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:06,779
space if it costs them twenty thirty

218
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:09,209
forty thousand dollars in order to do so

219
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can recoup the money and actually</font>

220
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,290
possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> make money in the process there</font>

221
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:14,519
are some other companies that it may

222
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:16,618
cost them hundreds of millions of

223
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,649
dollars to rewrite all their

224
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:22,529
applications databases everything in

225
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:24,449
order to move into v6 maybe just<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheaper</font>

226
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,509
to acquire additional before space it's

227
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:29,998
a win-win for both parties and it just

228
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:31,949
makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also if you've ever</font>

229
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:33,299
tried to justify you know a large

00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:36,599
migration effort to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your management</font>

231
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:38,220
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to put fairly accurate cost</font>

232
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,769
figures to what it's going to take a

233
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:45,329
cost to not do this is very important so

234
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:48,809
what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of our concerns about it</font>

235
00:10:45,329 --> 00:10:50,390
well took<font color="#E5E5E5"> me about a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours to</font>

236
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:53,150
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what it's trying to do</font>

237
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,880
then I had to talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lawyer who had</font>

238
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,230
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> select a different interpretation</font>

239
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,380
talk to you another lawyer who had yet a

240
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,540
third interpretation then actually tal

241
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,480
and I spent a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing</font>

242
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,579
what it actually means we think we

243
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,220
understand but the way the policy is

244
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,960
phrased can't we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it in actual</font>

245
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,730
simple English maybe I had a flow chart

246
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:18,290
or something the obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

247
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:20,720
also who's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create and run the</font>

248
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:22,790
market is this going to be an ebay type

249
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,830
setup is there going to be a scrote to

250
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:27,500
hold the IP space before it changes

251
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,830
hands all of those details<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be</font>

252
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,030
worked out obviously the question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

253
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:33,440
what's going to be the impact in the

254
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,839
routing system when the aggregation

255
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,790
comes around and more importantly should

256
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:40,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">Erin care erin has repeatedly stated</font>

257
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:43,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not responsible for routing</font>

258
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,010
of the networks or route ability of them

259
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,140
their responsibilities assignment should

260
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Erin policies even take that into</font>

261
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:53,930
account and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal view is no and</font>

262
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:58,640
do the benefits outweigh the trade-offs

263
00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:01,310
and for us absolutely because being able

264
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:05,510
to operate the business past 2012 is

265
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,369
critical and these policies will make it

266
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:13,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible maybe more expensive but</font>

267
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:18,920
they'll make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible thank you so</font>

268
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:20,660
next up is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin mark yeah but um can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

269
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,579
ask the speakers to maximize their

270
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,300
slides control well I think sandy taught

271
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,300
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

272

274
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:49,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually so one thing that may not be</font>

275
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:52,130
clear here but is true is that transfers

276
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:55,339
are going to happen regardless of lar

277
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:57,560
support or rir support for that matter

278
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:01,330
but prince was going to happen so this

279
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:05,750
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy that helps enable</font>

280
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:09,260
tracking and accuracy of data not not

281
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,310
that permits it to happen there are

282
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,760
certainly companies that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

287
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,390
there are drawbacks and there are

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,940
benefits one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drawbacks that I</font>

289
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,670
noted here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an odd one which is that</font>

290
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,790
our sales department now has to get

291
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:37,189
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> with knowing whether we have V</font>

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:45,290
the close of sale today we do this by

295
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:47,420
justification and if depending on the

296
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,530
company policy obviously and if you

297
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,329
exceed a certain amount of space you

298
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:53,209
might say go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the registry and</font>

299
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,110
get it yourself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some point we're</font>

300
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,670
not gonna be able to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

301
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:59,510
there won't be any space available and

302
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,189
our sales process may change<font color="#E5E5E5"> too we can</font>

303
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:03,590
acquire some space for you on your

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be a lot of interesting things</font>

today there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in place for</font>

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,850
takes a long time for us to adopt things

across all the companies and all the

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are bad people that are trying to</font>

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:14,640
time we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and on top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

333
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,280
things like our are really easy to spoof

334
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,840
most of them are still email from so you

335
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">can simply spoof a record</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> announce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

336
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,950
space and wait for someone to complain

337
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,720
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and then of course that put</font>

338
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:26,070
some operational impact on us headaches

339
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,720
trying to figure out ownership and

340
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:29,670
potentially headaches trying to

341
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:34,620
communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> another isp to get</font>

342
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:36,449
someone to stop hijacking your space so

343
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,860
another issue is ma is going to be much

344
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:39,450
harder to determine the net worth of an

345
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,300
asset how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when we're</font>

346
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,400
acquiring a company how to what value to

347
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:47,579
place on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their v4 resources as time goes</font>

348
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,810
on this means that price may go up for a

349
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:51,060
company that we might expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay a</font>

350
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,290
certain amount for and over time this is

351
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:57,750
going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> due diligence very</font>

352
00:15:52,290 --> 00:16:00,540
difficult here's a great kicker I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

353
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,380
community sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron just sent a letter</font>

354
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,050
to all officers of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations</font>

355
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:10,530
registered as Aaron members there was a

356
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:14,069
temp to educate officers to help them be

357
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:17,400
aware of v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> up-and-coming and to require</font>

358
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:20,490
officers to a test to resource requests

359
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,900
so so now they have this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new thing</font>

360
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,720
maybe they understand it maybe they

361
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,680
don't but what they do understand is

362
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,750
that therefore they're financially

363
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,459
responsible for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

364
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,160
probably don't want to run out of v4

365
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,750
resources at the same time they may do a

366
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,730
good thing which is start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

367
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:38,220
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> CTOs and their vp of ops and so on</font>

368
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:41,670
and get involved with implementing v6

369
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,440
but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this from a ceo's</font>

370
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,110
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also want to make sure I</font>

371
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,450
have as much before resources I need as

372
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:50,100
early as possible so there's high

373
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,990
potential for fraud of resource

374
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,240
utilization and high potential for

375
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,400
things like taking everything that's

376
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,990
currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ngata done an RFC 1918 space</font>

377
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,860
today and remembering that into public

378
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,240
v4 so you can

379
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:03,180
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as justification to get more</font>

380
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,460
space<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's perfectly reasonable it</font>

381
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:07,319
follows policy it means you can you can

382
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,450
justify<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new space and then when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

383
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,399
running out you can go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

384
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:14,550
remembering those in 1918 space and that

385
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to me is really scary this is a</font>

386
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,250
scary significant issue and it's

387
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:21,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to cause one out to</font>

388
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,910
happen faster so aside from the

389
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:25,230
drawbacks there are certainly benefits

390
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,960
contact information<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

391
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,370
accurate the likelihood is this process

392
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,650
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to clean up old contact</font>

393
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:35,040
information new contacts of information

394
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:38,970
and future transfer information and at

395
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:40,649
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that there</font>

396
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:42,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be more value in space that's</font>

397
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,750
transferred through someone like Aaron

398
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,400
or registry in that it's likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

399
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,500
it's clean your space then space that's

400
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,860
been transferred without the help of a

401
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,270
registry and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course it gives us the</font>

402
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:58,740
option to stay in business if we need

403
00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:01,740
before to survive I hope this forces us

404
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,410
all to write better tools use something

405
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,510
like a signing Authority use SB<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPUs</font>

406
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:10,860
better I our data have some way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

407
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:12,420
verify a resource is it should be

408
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,280
announced by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> entity that says</font>

409
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:19,350
they own it and I and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope also that</font>

410
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,210
we we take the time to start cleaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

411
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,550
our d aggregated prefixes now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

412
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:25,320
need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregated this this should</font>

413
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,080
as we start running out of writing

414
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:31,860
router resources we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to</font>

415
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,840
clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the routing table today and and</font>

416
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,879
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of transfer</font>

417
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,439
policy should make us aware that it's

418
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important to start cleaning up</font>

419
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,330
now I also hope to see something easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

420
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,730
implement that is conditional policy or

421
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,320
conditional route maps for router is

422
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,670
such that te can be done for when

423
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,460
something breaks we can announce the

424
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:58,440
smaller prefixes that we need when we

425
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,240
become islands so you know what comes

426
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of this you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you too late to</font>

427
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,630
change this it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in play it's going</font>

428
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:08,639

our view staff involved because spammers

436
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,910
are certainly going to get harder to

437
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,860
manage and blacklisting space or getting

438
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:28,170
space removed from black this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font>

439
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,679
to be a significant challenge as

00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:33,870
transfers happen so if you haven't

441
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">started using v6 to reduce these impacts</font>

process before it gets to this point

449
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thanks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron okay our next speaker</font>

is going to be Dan

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:11,119
still I go there we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

452
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:18,399
so as as one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisory council</font>

00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:20,169
members who with Aaron who actually had

to vote on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this policy there were there</font>

455
00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:25,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">were a lot of concerns by all of us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

456
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,899
what the implications of of this change

457
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:32,769
might be but in the end I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it</font>

458
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:35,529
will serve a good purpose in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

459
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:37,450
another tool in the kit that

460
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:42,730
organizations can use during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

461
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:48,460
transition to ipv6 once Aaron is no

462
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:51,580
longer a source of resources the the

463
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:54,609
primary goal was not to extend the life

464
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:58,178
of v4 or to continually perpetuate its

465
00:20:54,609 --> 00:21:01,359
use it was so organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> could still</font>

466
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:03,220
possibly acquire resources to manage

467
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:08,678
through the transition and also a now

468
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:13,389
allow new entrants into the market from

469
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the perspective of a large</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP we don't</font>

470
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:20,678
see this as a major benefit or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a path</font>

471
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:26,249
forward given the the global consumption

472
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:29,470
of IP resources any supply that would be

473
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:31,989
that would come about by this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:35,799
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> change isn't going to provide for</font>

475
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:37,779
very long term growth and from an ISPs

476
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:41,139
perspective there's very little

477
00:21:37,779 --> 00:21:44,139
incentive for an ISP<font color="#CCCCCC"> to relinquish their</font>

478
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:46,629
resources during this transition phase

479
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:52,988
because they're needed to provide

480
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:55,449
connectivity for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own customers in</font>

481
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:57,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end v6 is still just the way forward</font>

482
00:21:55,450 --> 00:22:00,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devices</font>

483
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:04,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are joining the internet that would</font>

484
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:06,460
benefit from unique IPS even if we were

485
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:10,178
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take advantage of a transfer</font>

486
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:14,379
policy there it still doesn't change the

00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:17,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">art path of deploying native v6</font>

connectivity

489
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:25,289
okay great last<font color="#E5E5E5"> not least is Kevin</font>

490
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,879
first of all I'm speaking for myself not

491
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,950
my employers the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> government any of</font>

492
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,690
those other folks I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> treating those</font>

493
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,370
even have an opinion on these matters I

494
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:46,740
suspect the answer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they do not</font>

495
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:48,719
and of course as always I do have an

496
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,899
opinion on everything and it's worth

497
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,509
everything you paid for it first of all

498
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:56,279
the transfer policy is a little bit

499
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:59,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind the times because in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact there's</font>

500
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,830
already transfers going on subrosa

501
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:03,979
various mechanisms are being used to do

502
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:06,960
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's pretty small scale right now</font>

503
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,539
but the reality of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is that if</font>

504
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a commodity that has some value</font>

505
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,769
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be monetized in any way someone</font>

506
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">somewhere is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be interested in</font>

507
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">buying it legally or otherwise and if</font>

508
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,830
the commodity is in short supply and if

509
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,600
it's essential for doing your business

510
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">the price is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to grow to the point</font>

511
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,759
where people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sell that is</font>

512
00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:28,919
simple reality and all of the idealists

513
00:23:26,759 --> 00:23:31,889
who say that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should never</font>

514
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,049
be charged for that's just simply not

515
00:23:31,889 --> 00:23:35,908
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen the only question is how</font>

516
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:39,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">its controlled and regulated and where</font>

517
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:41,370
the money flows prohibition just simply

518
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,830
does not work that's why this transfer

519
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:45,989
policy was so important or at least

520
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:49,230
could have been if anybody could really

521
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:51,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand it but every time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to</font>

522
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,879
prohibit some form of commodity market

523
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:56,519
that a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> segment of the population</font>

524
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:58,259
wants to be involved in when I see a

525
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,019
large that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean anywhere near a</font>

526
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:02,970
majority well that prohibition has

527
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:06,480
historically failed prohibition was one

528
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:09,659
of the great social disasters of of the

00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:13,769
tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be expensive and it tends to</font>

533
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:21,059
control we don't want a black market

534
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,220
black markets are ad hoc there is no

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,459
fairness about it it's a case of

539
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:34,889
somebody wants something somebody has

540
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,389
something and they reach some sort of

541
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:39,600
agreement that may or<font color="#CCCCCC"> may not be</font>

542
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:43,019
beneficial to society as a whole the

543
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,559
pulse that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have now is a start it was</font>

544
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:48,570
put together probably by as little as

545
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,080
consensus as any air in policy that has

546
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:53,939
ever been implemented I believe

547
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,699
consensus rough consensus means that

548
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:59,879
most of the air in policies there's not

549
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">a slaw r JH body that objects to it very</font>

550
00:24:59,879 --> 00:25:04,559
vocally this<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy there is still a</font>

551
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:06,870
large number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who object to it</font>

552
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,809
vocally but the reality is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a</font>

553
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:12,029
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does allow the transfer of</font>

554
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:14,100
address space we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need a policy that</font>

555
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:19,379
allows it to happen in a manner that is

556
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:21,240
regulated fair but that does not stifle

557
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,408
the market so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people go around the</font>

558
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,999
market the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have that</font>

559
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:26,639
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in any large number you're</font>

560
00:25:23,999 --> 00:25:29,039
back to the nrt but the bottom line is

561
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:30,979
when a / 18 stand between you and the

562

continued existence of your business

563
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:35,610
would you be<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to buy that address</font>

00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:37,529
block on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> black market the answer for</font>

an awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people is yes and until</font>

566
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:42,720
the transfer policy it reaches<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font>

where the number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in that mode</font>

568
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,649
near zero the problem is not solved

574
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:10,019
until the policy removes the requirement

575
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,369
to justify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the address space that you're</font>

still going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a black market</font>

579
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,149
to exist because someone wants outer

space that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they know they can't go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

581
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:22,408
Erin and justify or someone wants outer

582
00:26:20,309 --> 00:26:24,059
space to do something shady to begin

583
00:26:22,409 --> 00:26:29,700

585
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,059
i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> not implying there should be no</font>

586
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,309
justification<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said it needs to be a</font>

587
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:37,139
regulated controlled market but the

588
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,779
justification requirements have to be

589
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:42,209
such that you do not have a significant

590
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:44,879
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who decide they have to</font>

591
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:48,149
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> around the regulations and basically</font>

592
00:26:44,879 --> 00:26:51,029
cheat by using a black market<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

593
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:52,498
we need to have some regulation that

594
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:55,769
ensures fairness of address space

595
00:26:52,499 --> 00:26:58,019
distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just simply has to be</font>

596
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:58,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">flexible enough that it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

597
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,150
work

598
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:04,190
so the justification requirement is the

599
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:07,070
same as what it takes to get outer space

600
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,799
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin today are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you saying that that</font>

601
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:12,350
should be relaxed or changed actually

602
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:15,440
that standard is probably depending on

603
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:17,840
how you read the transfer policy once

604
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">again transfer policy is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

605
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,309
understandable thing in the world and I

606
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that I probably did not understand</font>

607
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:26,059
it as most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people in this room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

608
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:27,559
at least the most people who spoke and

609
00:27:26,059 --> 00:27:30,320
understood it I'm hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're</font>

610
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:32,629
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm wrong unfortunately that</font>

611
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">will get lawyers involved too so that</font>

612
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">also presents problems but no I think</font>

613
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:40,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the justification that's there now is</font>

614
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:44,389
one that is fairly reasonable and it

615
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:46,220
will work effectively as long as there

616
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:49,039
are a reasonable<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of people who</font>

617
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:53,450
are prepared to sign address<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sign</font>

618
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,549
address space under these grounds so the

619
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:58,450
I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm trying to say is the</font>

620
00:27:55,549 --> 00:28:01,429
problem then isn't any different today

621
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:03,080
so the black market that exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> today is</font>

622
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:04,400
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

623
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin for whatever variety of reasons</font>

624
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,490
it's going to exist post depletion

625
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:12,860
anyway the market day is small and as

626
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,539
long as we keep it small then the system

627
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:19,250
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> break down when it gets large</font>

628
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:21,440
that's when things fail Marty and

629
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:23,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually I think one of the concerns is</font>

630
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,840
that as the space starts to run out the

631
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,928
policy makes justification a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

632
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,520
difficult and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

633
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:36,350
market will grow and that's not

634
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,480
something we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to occur all right hey</font>

635
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:40,010
Marty hey guys thanks to this panel it's

636
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,130
really good and informative I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

637
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:45,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to offer a couple of data points</font>

638
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,030
so when you talk about markets I think

639
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:48,679
you're talking about the markets or you

640
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,928
believe that the markets are as small as

641
00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,640
they were what david conrad was saying

642
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,200
that the markets existed three or four

643
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,510
years ago and everyone doubted them

644
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,299
today the market is much bigger than

645
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:01,760
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you seem to apply here i</font>

646
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:03,860
can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i can give you data points</font>

647
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,879
such as IP addresses are worth something

648
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:09,709
like for dolls<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a dress / 32 that it's</font>

649
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,460
evolved to sophisticated models like

650
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:12,890
leasing

651
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:17,450
and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that you know talking</font>

652
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:19,190
about policy to try and address this at

653
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,510
some corporate level is probably not

654
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,820
going to be effective and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

655
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:24,830
behind the behind the eight ball so to

656
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,020
speak I think we're going to see people

657
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:29,689
do exactly what they want and find ways

658
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,980
to get around<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin with their address</font>

659
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,140
space if they think that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make a</font>

660
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:34,340
buck in I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's going to be</font>

661
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,440
important when that happens is that

662
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,449
there's some level of trust I don't

663
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know where Aaron is going to be</font>

664
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,360
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play in this and I don't I'm not</font>

665
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:44,360
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not going to be able</font>

666
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,620
to but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that you know everyone</font>

667
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,810
should wake<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a little bit and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

668
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:49,250
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not just a black market</font>

669
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:50,899
there's a lot of unanswered questions

670
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:54,140
and it's a lot bigger than people think

671
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:57,800
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is thank you yeah part part of that</font>

672
00:29:54,140 --> 00:30:00,980
that point is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> great as how is how</font>

673
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:03,110
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operations people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to play</font>

674
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:04,580
in this transfer policy is really an

675
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,560
important piece we already know that

676
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,240
that transfers are going to happen and

677
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,679
there is right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so many our</font>

678
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,050
involvement some registry involvement

679
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,650
some without registries but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

680
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:17,419
need some way of controlling those

681
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,770
controlling the authenticity of those

682
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:22,100
transfers so it doesn't get out of

683
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:24,320
control so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go ahead and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">close the mic because I work we are</font>

near depletion in the past there have

695
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,300
been some discussions about making it

more difficult as we near depletion in

the future we will continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have such</font>

698
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,600
discussions if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a good</font>

699

idea to ration the IP space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font>

more difficult to get addresses as we

near depletion I urge you to get

702

think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad idea because it</font>

no problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all ok might be</font>

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to explore the security</font>

719
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,610
ramifications of how Aaron is going to

<font color="#E5E5E5">deal with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer request and but</font>

721
00:31:53,610 --> 00:32:00,779
that's a separate matter entirely<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

722
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:02,429
that assumes that Aaron is always part

723
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:05,250
of the process so they currently are

724
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:07,049
part of the process but if we keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

725
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,419
and relaxing the policy if we ever get

726
00:32:07,049 --> 00:32:11,158
to a point where possibly Aaron is not

727
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:13,710
part of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> process as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the transfer</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">agent of the escrow agent yes then it</font>

729
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:19,820
becomes I would think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would become</font>

730
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:22,110
quite a challenge well just

731
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:24,480
extemporaneously<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say that it is</font>

732
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:28,469
possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now in the rpki</font>

definition for some entity to allocate

all of its resources to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

736
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:39,090
wanted to insert some other trusted

party to speak to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transfers so that</font>

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,100
the second party<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be assured</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

739
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:45,689
addresses would never get pulled back

740
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,570
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a different matter</font>

741
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:51,649
entirely if Aaron wasn't the second

742
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:51,649
party<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

743
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:00,769
this is manish for merit one<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern I</font>

744
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:02,659
had with the this and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin</font>

account the cost on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgb global</font>

747
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,918
routing table and this policy more than

anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a direct impact on the</font>

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,950
growth of that table I mean if you're

going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to trade</font>

752
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,269
whole massive increase in the global

753
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:22,279
table my personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion is I've always</font>

754
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:24,019
said you know I've always thought that

755
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:26,149
Erin probably should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be concerned</font>

756
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:28,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this but the more you look at</font>

757
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:31,789
policies like this they cannot exist

758
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:34,549
independent of or an awareness of the

759
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:36,769
impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global routing table just</font>

760
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:38,809
keep in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point that's made</font>

761
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:40,700
clear in all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our Dex's the</font>

transfer policy in place is this this is

765
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:54,320
primarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the purpose of keeping</font>

00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:56,720
contact information accurate yeah and

767
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,580
what's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> the growing routing table I</font>

768
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,620
mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just the cost of doing</font>

business on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to you</font>

770
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:05,870
just have to keep upgrading new gear and

771
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:07,760
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply the cost to do business if</font>

772
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:14,179
you can't do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> then get out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>
