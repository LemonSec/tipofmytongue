are responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for working together</font>

22
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,519
when we have global policies to make

participate in tomorrow's ipv6 panel

discussion we have a discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

64
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,030
about status of ipv6 in the operator

65
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,190
community we definitely welcome feedback

66
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:45,260
if you can stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the iron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting the</font>

67
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:46,930
iron meeting runs through Friday we're

68
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,519
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss a number of interesting</font>

69
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,440
policies that are on the docket this

70
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,410
includes a global policy for assignment

71
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,170
of ASM blocks an allocation a global

72
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,569
policy for allocation of ipv4 blocks to

73

regional internet registries this<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy</font>

74
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,890
has some interesting implications

75
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:07,879
because it sets what happens to return

76
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:10,069
blocks and it also sets how return

77
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:13,760
blocks are divided<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and used by the</font>

78
00:03:10,069 --> 00:03:15,738
rirs when there isn't much space left so

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,310
a fairly important issue for operators

80
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:22,180
to look into open access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ipv6 we have</font>

81
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,579
some very modest criteria for ipv6

82
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:28,459
allocations and this policy makes them

83
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:30,260
more modest removing a little bit of

84
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:32,780
them and it's worth discussion in the

85

88
00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:40,400
that actually came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit in</font>

89
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:41,780
earlier discussions this week will be
