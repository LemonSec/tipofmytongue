quantitative data about these trends

whereas most of the previous analysis is

this really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is nothing of the sort this</font>

146
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,060
is just a s level very coarse-grained

147

we'd expect from the commercial data or

180
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:58,900
through all the slides we're really

181
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,479
looking at percentage our estimated

182
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,830
percentage of all internet traffic and

183
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,600
that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a number of reasons</font>

184
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,400
including the fact that the data is a

185
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,460
little bit noisy as people add routers

186
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,650
lose routers join the nonnamous

with that said<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain traffic I</font>

191
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,190

00:09:13,899 --> 00:09:18,829
so jump into the major findings as i

said i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot of</font>

dramatic some the shifts have been even

over the last two years it<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:42,349
as an estimate of the popular

224
00:09:40,099 --> 00:09:45,379
imagination that the internet was is

225
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:47,059
very democratic nebulous cloud and she

234
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:06,499
what my mother doesn't realize is that

235
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,809
likely she's going and this is few

00:10:16,069 --> 00:10:20,988
coming up in a few slides a really

241
00:10:18,109 --> 00:10:23,869
dramatic<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in the distribution of</font>

243
00:10:23,869 --> 00:10:28,729
years really the traffic migrating out

of the edge out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprises into</font>

245
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:34,399

amongst the googles and Microsoft's of

247
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,989
the world perhaps the most compelling

248
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:41,659
result in the slide deck I'll come to

249
00:10:38,989 --> 00:10:44,329
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> three or four slides is that</font>

250
00:10:41,659 --> 00:10:47,749
in 2007 it really was the case that

251
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:49,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousands of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs contributed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

252
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:50,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">really you had to get to basically</font>

253
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:52,459
several thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs to reach 50</font>

254
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:57,229
percent on average of<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet traffic</font>

255
00:10:52,459 --> 00:11:00,649
as of<font color="#CCCCCC"> July 2009 you only need a hundred</font>

256
00:10:57,229 --> 00:11:02,619
and fifty origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns to generate fifty</font>

257
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:06,799
percent on average all internet traffic

258
00:11:02,619 --> 00:11:08,419
so very dramatic shift not only has

259
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,299
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic been coming from</font>

260
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:13,449
shifting and consolidating but also the

261
00:11:11,299 --> 00:11:15,819
applications have been changing as well

262
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:17,620
basically over time Warren

263
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,140
our traffic is migrating to the web and

264
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,210
we're seeing declines basically in all

265
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:24,699
other well-known ports and application

266
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,800
groups you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the one way I think of</font>

267
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:29,800
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the great vision the great</font>

268
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:34,300
battle for the end-to-end network has

269
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:37,479
been fought and it's been lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> as IPS is</font>

270
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,390
IDS's firewalls even microsoft recently

271
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:42,640
converted<font color="#E5E5E5"> xbox which used to use all of</font>

272
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,790
its own protocols and ports just to port

273
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:48,250
80 presumably to simplify some the

274
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,469
headaches of customer management and

275
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,700
configuration so increasingly we're

276
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,340
seeing a shift to port 80 and

277
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,860
increasingly I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the data belies the</font>

278
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:59,230
shift others have written about about

279
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,340
the web increasingly being the front end

280
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:04,270
for mail and all other applications

281
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:06,790
finally I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most interesting</font>

282
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,610
point at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my perspective is</font>

283
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what really is fascinating about</font>

284
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">the changes is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> degree</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of economic</font>

285
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,290
change and logical topology change that

286
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,000
we're seeing for the first time I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

287
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,270
we've crossed the threshold where the

288
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:24,480
majority of traffic now flows directly

into regional and into a poor the most

324
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,570

still have an Aegis coffee mug on my

330
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,100
actually look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data again looking</font>

331
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,880
at all asn traffic from their

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:16,760
perspective of the 110 ISPs giving us

333
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:19,100
anonymous traffic data I'll stress again

334
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,020
in the gray box that the data here we

335

have is no relationship to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Observatory</font>

336
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,270

337
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:29,149
on the view of these ISPs from all the

338

342
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,810
rather than get into a long discussion

343
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,209
about what is a tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 what is not if</font>

344
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:48,439
you're one I'll say whatever wikipedia

345
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:49,969
says must be is truth so this just

346
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,690
responded i think the page patrick

347
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,370
helped edit on the list of tier once and

348
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:58,820
again this is a weighted average percent

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:02,350
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all traffic with level three global</font>

350
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:07,010
crossing the top in the other tier ones

351
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:08,750
but then what was true for maybe 10 12

<font color="#CCCCCC">years of the internet the world has been</font>

some of the economic and some of the

well you know one of the key components

00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:51,219
that's really driving the change we call

changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also new economic models and</font>

614
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:44,800
this perhaps is the hardest to quantify

615
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,440
since a lot of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes place under</font>

616
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,169
NDA but there's a lot of experimentation

617
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,960
with paid content such as ESPN 360 or

618
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:56,820
the sky<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the UK we're seeing a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

folks experiment with paid transit and

620
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,090
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think most broadly what really</font>

621
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:04,210
are seeing is in economic terms

622
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:05,949
disintermediation<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in the economic</font>

624
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">means removal of intermediaries from the</font>

625
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,800
supply chain as both folks like Google

626
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,440
and Akamai and others are looking both

627
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,389
at cost but increasingly it's not about

628
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,450
cost it's actually about performance as

629
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:24,910
the CD ends and the hosters and others

630
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:26,080
have s la-based metrics and very

631
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:29,440
interested on the getting best

632
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,020
performance from the content to the

633
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,540
consumer so this brings us at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

634
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:36,670
my diagram of what if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't show what</font>

635
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,500
the new internet looks like increasingly

00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:40,059
the data shows a new internet really

637
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:44,200
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a much more densely</font>

638
00:26:40,059 --> 00:26:46,270
interconnected cloud of large consumer

639
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,190
and content all direct peering whether

640
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,750
it be settlement free or paid transit or

641
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:51,390
other

642
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,950
things under NDA the cheer ones are

00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">still large they still are a critical</font>

connected content and consumer and I

649
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,100
think that you know there really is no

650
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,780
local provider anymore the locals have

651
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,070
all been absorbed in the regional so we

652
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,600
have much flatter<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well just</font>

you can say what you want about was

YouTube a good idea or bad idea but this

673
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:07,110
is I think a fairly dramatic change to

make an acquisition<font color="#E5E5E5"> alpi it for several</font>

the net about what's happening we've

talked to analysts it really seems to be

707
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:29,539
the case that Comcast successfully

708
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,100
execute on the triple play they entered

709
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:33,740

764
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:53,030
namely youtube and so forth so i think

765
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,250
broadly the conclusions would come from

00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:57,980
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at both the well-known ports and</font>

declining as more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more traffic</font>

is mainly because wired and other people

as they describe it here to peer back in

growth was sixty seventy percent all

795
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,159
networks were bending down FCC you know

796
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,990
there's no neutrality discussions

797
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,230
there's just incredible amount to press

798
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,700
all around peer-to-peer so it's perhaps

799
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:15,770
interesting that when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

800
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:18,650
well-known ports as well as payload

801
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:21,320
based analysis of peer-to-peer that by

802
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:23,570
2009 the great evil boogeyman of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet is retreating and retreating</font>

804
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:28,250
quickly again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is market share so</font>

805
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:29,600
absolute volumes of peer-to-peer may not

806
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,740
have dropped it significantly but as a

807
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,110
percentage of

808
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,179
traffic peer-to-peer is not growing as

809
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:37,070
quickly as other traffic forms so it's

810
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:40,010
losing market share in fact we believe

811
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,510
there's an absolute decline as well so

812
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:43,910
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most popular well-known</font>

813
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,710
ports but the analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the same if</font>

814
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:48,380
you look at Korean ports if you look at

815
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:52,340
Chinese peer-to-peer if you look at all

816
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:54,200
of the sorts of data sets and I should

817
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:55,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">mention that you know the trend varies</font>

818
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,309
by region Asia actually has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

819
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:02,300
slower to decline in peer-to-peer than

00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:04,250
other parts of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world so peer-to-peer</font>

821
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,919
there are still significant volumes

822
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:09,230
appear to peer peer to peer is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gone</font>

823
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:10,850
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still in some some networks</font>

824
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:13,490
it's still thirty forty percent of all

825
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:15,710
traffic but broadly we think it's closer

826
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:18,199
eighteen to twenty percent globally on

827
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,899
average<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and the growth has slowed</font>

828
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:23,089
so that's declining in terms of internet

829
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:25,638
market share from all other applications

830
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:26,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think when we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the data we</font>

831
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,460
talked to providers we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

832
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,530
analysts we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to three</font>

833
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,629
conclusions about why the shift is

834
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:34,220
happening number one there's clearly

835
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:36,859
some evidence of provider traffic

836
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:38,868
management again providers in different

837
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:40,879
parts of Europe and perhaps a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

838
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:43,369
North America actually doing different

839
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,600
sorts of traffic engineering but I don't

840
00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that's really the significant</font>

841
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,069
story and neither his next one which is

842
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:51,049
there have been significant improvements

843
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,550
in peer-to-peer it used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the case</font>

844
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,010
when we look at peer-to-peer clients

845
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:57,470
again it would as happily go to Asia<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

850
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:08,540
peer-to-peer but really I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think when we</font>

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,960
been eclipsed by streaming CDN and

861
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:32,240
direct download and it should mention

862
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,400
that by streaming in CDN really it's a

863
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,040
success on the commercial legitimate

864
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,040
sources like I player and iTunes and

865
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:42,509
Hulu and so forth as well as direct

866
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,850
downloads which have varying degrees of

867
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:50,310
I think focus on intellectual property

868
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:51,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">issues this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one example and I</font>

869
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:54,270
like this graph because this very

870
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:56,880
clearly allows us to distinguish the

871
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:58,890
contribution of direct download this

872
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,590
graph is part of a quiz can anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

873
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:08,640
when megavideo became a customer of

00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:09,810
Carpathia Hosting I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> Homs all I'm</font>

875
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,150
running out of time so I'll jump to the

876
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:15,330
answer it clearly was that dramatic

877
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:17,280
spike<font color="#CCCCCC"> November</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of early two thousand</font>

878
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:19,560
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the very dramatic</font>

879
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,900
spike in the contribution really over

880
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:23,820
overnight Carpathia went from you know

881
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:26,160
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small I mean in terms of traffic</font>

882
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:27,690
volume to now approaching five point

883
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,440
five point six percent of all internet

884
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,930
traffic so I'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish with just</font>

885
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,550
a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes left for questions again</font>

886
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,560
there is a tech report coming out which

887
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:39,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">is 30 or by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time we're done you know</font>

888
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,670
maybe even longer pages hopefully will

889
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:44,190
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> out shortly providing much more</font>

890

891
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet's at an inflection point for</font>

893
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:53,640
with the internet certainly the focus

894
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:56,220
was all about connectivity speeds and

895
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:59,430
feeds today we're really seeing the

896
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,500
economic discussions the academic

897
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:04,919
discussions technical discussions really

00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:12,090
basically had only handful of economic

models of care metered based internet

902

new technologies which like whether it

00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,370
be netbooks or cloud and I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

910
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,530
what cloud means anymore by the way but

911
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:37,410
we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> wealth cloud the migration</font>

00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,120
of applications the web and at least

915

916
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">means there's lots of really interesting</font>

917
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:50,160
security challenges in engineering

918
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,050
challenges and finally this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

919
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,509
beginning as we talked to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

920
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:56,070
LTE folks as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to other things the</font>

921
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:58,750
mobile space since

922
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:01,990
we think the rate of<font color="#CCCCCC"> change based on the</font>

923
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:04,240
data is accelerating and we'll even more

924
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:06,100
dramatic in the next few years with that

925
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,729
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly four minutes for</font>

926
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:08,730
questions

927
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,259
hi quick thanks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot for sharing this</font>

928
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:28,010
one thing that jumps out at me is of

929
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:29,990
course video is a much larger amount of

930
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,930
traffic for any interaction one might

931
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:35,509
have with an application right when you

932
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:37,279
download a video that's going to be lots

933
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:39,920
and lots of megabytes versus downloading

934
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,350
an email or Twitter or whatever I wonder

935
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,560
if that's kind of skewing things in the

936
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:48,620
analysis I mean if the growth of video

937
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,660
traffic you know it goes pretty big

938
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,109
anyone screaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> video traffic will show</font>

939
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:56,830
up very very high in your analysis right

940
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:59,300
so we're kind of discounting the

941
00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:02,049
importance of those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not doing</font>

942
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:04,940
video would you agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that yes I</font>

943
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:06,740
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in the tech report you</font>

944
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:10,940
know it takes an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tweets to</font>

945
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:12,649
make up a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> HD screen whereas you</font>

946
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">know clearly as SMS is demonstrated</font>

947
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:19,370
volume and difficulty of delivery don't

948
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">always equate with pricing Patrick I did</font>

949
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:23,750
mention after my yes you did thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

950
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,009
so in the report you mentioned inter<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s</font>

951
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:28,220
traffic and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned that you try</font>

952
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:30,650
to group companies so lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies</font>

953
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,020
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> telia tisk lead telefonica</font>

954
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:34,910
comcast etc have a backbone and then

955
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:37,250
they have an AS with eyeballs in it are

956
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,540
you measuring from their backbone<font color="#E5E5E5"> or are</font>

957
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,030
you grouping that together are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

958
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:44,930
measuring the backbone to eyeball is

959
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:46,040
edge or how does that work yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might</font>

960
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,450
be easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take it offline business</font>

961
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,370
gets a little bit complicated but we did

962
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:51,350
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a s paths to avoid a number of</font>

963
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:53,720
issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> including double counting of SN</font>

964
00:39:51,350 --> 00:39:56,000
so tried to capture as close to the edge

965
00:39:53,720 --> 00:40:00,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network as we could the group asn</font>

966
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just to add some data to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

967
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:06,170
paper optimized peering a s is less than

968
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:09,170
twenty percent of our traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Thank</font>

969
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:11,540
You Patrick since the gentleman from

970
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:15,380
Carpathia has nothing to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll ask a</font>

971
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:16,490
question when you rank so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

972
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,020
networks that are bigger on inbound

973
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:19,790
networks that are bigger on outbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

974
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:22,550
you showed some of the ratio<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff when</font>

975
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:25,000
you rank the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network's by traffic is</font>

976
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:26,960
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of taking ignoring the vector</font>

977
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,310
dimension of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

978
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,300
ranking total bytes

979
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:34,220
seen inflows so a large so if someone is

980
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:38,120
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> five or number six it could be</font>

981
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:39,919
all in all out or some mix yeah so in

982
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,470
the most of the ranking it was in plus

983
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,090
out so it was the overall vector though

984
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,009
he did to the analysis separately which

985
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:47,750
was you saw you know some vestiges of

986
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,340
that and like the comcast discussion

987
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,500
which is kind of an interesting metric

988
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:53,120
right itself is some of the data

989
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,280
presented in the tech report broken out

990
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:57,380
that way or it's mostly just the hidden

991
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,150
plus they out mmm maybe a little bit

992
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,490
more but I think it's mostly in plus out

993
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,920
we ran out of room in time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

994
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:08,390
thanks yep you already asked a question

995
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,100
Patrick now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another is this what</font>

996
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:14,450
are the number is 95th percentile pink

997
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:17,390
average the primarily average so bites

998
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:19,189
delivered toes yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

999
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:21,890
I think I'm out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time I should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font>

1000
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:24,770
that my co-authors Farnham and I think

1001
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,410
Scott and John are here<font color="#CCCCCC"> gandee's Mike I</font>

1002
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:30,160
think he's hunting and kill some wild

1003
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:30,160
animals but thank you

1004
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:40,250
you
