and I'm covering what we call like the

51
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:02,349
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten techniques we would like to get</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of materials and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already got an hour</font>

58
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,260
about this is a primer that was put

59
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:19,629
together several years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

60
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,129
community which we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp</font>

61
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">sac which is network service for our</font>

security group it's a group that helps

63
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:27,459
each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect each other's</font>

00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">different operational security</font>

74
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,720
organizations out there operational

75
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,010
security is the type of security that

76
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,010
when you're not looking for problems

77
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,569
problems happen to you right so in other

78
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,159
words stuff happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you you get an</font>

79
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:55,978
attack you getting violated you getting

80
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,388
das attack whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you need help</font>

81
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,010
because we live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a world where we</font>

82
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:02,849
can't do this by yourself anymore you

83
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:07,328
need peers you need to work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

84
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:08,349
this material it should go up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

85
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:09,849
it's not up there there'll be two

86
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,069
versions they'll be a PDF version and

87
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:13,478
they'll be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerPoint version we</font>

88
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed the slides in such a way that</font>

89
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,409
it's free use because one of the things

90
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,940
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found out years ago is that</font>

91
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:20,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are those people who are really</font>

92
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">good at service of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security and they</font>

93
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,289
come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the techniques and the</font>

94
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:24,969
deployed a technique so I'll point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

95
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:26,320
chris maher over here he's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

96
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,510
guys he he figured out what two

97
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,449
techniques on networks he's run but um

98
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:33,729
you know I you know I can do better

99
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,530
slides and Chris can do so he'll figure

100
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">out the technique and then i'll do the</font>

101
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,000
slides right and then crystal use my

102
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,620
slides and wherever companies at right

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,060
and this is what this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of works you</font>

104
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:45,909
know growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> up da ones over here he did</font>

105
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">this presentation last time so he did a</font>

106
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:49,180
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> slides so what we do is tho</font>

107
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:51,009
those of us who are good illustrators we

108
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,870
put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the slides those of us who</font>

109
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:54,970
are good technicians and figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

110
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,289
to do stuff we figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font>

111
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,820
help each other out this way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we make</font>

112
00:04:56,289 --> 00:04:58,900
this for use so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way you can take</font>

113
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">these slides if you're trying to</font>

114
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">convince your management we</font>

115
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,029
to do this you grab this slide deck and

116
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:06,729
you cut and paste into your company

117
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:08,199
slide deck that's what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is out there</font>

118
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:10,419
for so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we're making easy</font>

119
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,279
because you see in it here you say hey I

120
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:14,169
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that technique well I want to</font>

121
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:15,819
do it another<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of this technique</font>

122
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,979
because these are all the basic they're

123
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:19,989
actually add ons you can do to this that

124
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,669
people have figured out you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

125
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:25,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">convince your management that's what</font>

126
00:05:21,669 --> 00:05:28,659
these slides are here for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

127
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:30,758
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 10 basic ones that are</font>

128
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:32,319
vendor-independent in other words pretty

129
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,519
much any<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor gear you get out there</font>

130
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,110
you can use them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one of the</font>

131
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,240
criteria looking at the bake it vendor

132
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,830
agnostic as the foundation techniques

133
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,899
and these are the techniques when

134
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,269
somebody picks up the phone and says hey

135
00:05:40,899 --> 00:05:44,259
I need help to stop a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doss attack you</font>

136

need to be at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same level playing</font>

137
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:48,490
field because I hey let's do it let's

up my network i<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannot call it that way</font>

143
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:59,649
you can work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with your peers together</font>

144
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:01,269
using the same foundation baseline

145
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:03,159
technique with it so that's the idea

146
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,389
with this stuff and what's this all

147
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:06,129
about you know what do you tell your

148
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,499
boss when your network blows up from a

149
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:11,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">DOS attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's intentional or</font>

150
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:14,469
collateral right so in these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you</font>

151
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:16,419
know all happen out there um this

152
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:18,729
watershed moment actually happen at a

153
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:20,498
nano service where security is kind of a

154
00:06:18,729 --> 00:06:22,359
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> feel from like enterprise</font>

155
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:23,439
security it's really interested is

156
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,979
really hard to take someone who's a

157
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,539
who's like you know certified and

158
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:29,619
trained and<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise security and get</font>

159
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:31,839
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think in the service of our</font>

160
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:33,459
security world because what's different

161
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,529
about it is enterprise security comes up

162
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,269
in firewalls and<font color="#E5E5E5"> IEPs and you know</font>

163
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:40,659
audits and audit trails and things like

164
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:43,749
that where a service or security guy is

165
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:45,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh let me wrap this problem you</font>

166
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:46,929
know you control backbones and routing

167
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:52,479
protocols it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different mentality and</font>

168
00:06:46,929 --> 00:06:54,638
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a.m. to get a</font>

170
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,759
engineer thinking that you can actually

171
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">use a rat protocol as your biggest</font>

172
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,619
strength that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the taken route to null 0</font>

173
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,629
is one of your best defensive tools that

174
00:07:02,619 --> 00:07:07,119
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect your network a guy</font>

175
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,979
who is used to firewalls an access list

176
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:10,449
can't get their mind set amount as a

177
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:12,460
paradigm shift with it so that's why

178
00:07:10,449 --> 00:07:14,800
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different different field</font>

179
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">30 2000 we had these big press visible</font>

180
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,430
attacks we have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of</font>

181
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,199
the room go work in the attacks though

182
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,669
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog that you know certain</font>

183
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:22,960
people said hey we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually step</font>

184
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:24,430
up and start thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how we're</font>

185
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,109
going to protect the service by our

186
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:29,639
backbones and that's where this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

187
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:33,520
starting evolved from so and you know

188
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:35,590
overview right so you know there's all

189
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,030
this stuff going out there now there's a

190
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,590
community out there so this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

191
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,239
here this interest in wiring article

192
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,770
it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull up with it</font>

193
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they call this the community of</font>

194
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">the affected all right and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk</font>

195
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:47,770
more about this group called<font color="#E5E5E5"> MSP sec</font>

196
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,990
which we entirely encourage people to

197
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:51,758
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at joining because with this with</font>

198
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:53,740
this demonstrating with this article

199
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,729
demonstrated is when the attacks happen

200
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:59,530
against estonia<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the people in</font>

201
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">estonia the networks in estonia we're</font>

202
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,979
having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard time figuring how to</font>

203
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:05,289
defend themselves but what was happening

204
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:07,960
is immediately they reached out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> NSB</font>

205
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:09,759
sec we got like one particular guy from

206
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,948
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Estonian computer emergency</font>

207
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,930
response team vetted into<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp suck and</font>

208
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,550
then you had the entire world helping

209
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:19,169
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> Estonia every service of our</font>

210
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,909
backbone helping out bostonia right and

211
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,310
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the key ways that Estonia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

212
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:25,840
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not by Estonia doing</font>

213
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,460
something by themselves but by then

214
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,530
collaborate with service<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyers all</font>

215
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,880
over the world our best defense is each

216
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,529
other so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look around here in</font>

217
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,689
the room right getting to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

218
00:08:32,529 --> 00:08:36,909
other is really really important because

219
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,589
when stuff happens we got to rely upon

220
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:40,929
each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defend ourselves that's</font>

221
00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:43,029
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way that the end-to-end paradigm</font>

222
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,800
you know of the internet means we have

223
00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:48,430
to work with each other end-to-end to

224
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,079
defend ourselves so in this some more

225
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,810
slides you can use in here that we put

226
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:54,670
in with it so MSP<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC is is and this</font>

227
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,899
this this isn't like hierarch only thing

228
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of throw slides in their</font>

229
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:59,440
kind of show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this stuff in</font>

230
00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,089
there and there's there's a you know

231
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,220
communities out there that work with

232
00:09:01,089 --> 00:09:06,399
each other I'll talk I'll dive into some

233
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,959
of them in NSB<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC is one of them here's</font>

234
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,450
a URL with it this is kind of where this

235
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:15,040
all came from I'll dive in a little bit

236
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:17,410
more economic cycles how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

237
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,199
here have heard huh Murray team camry

238
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay right so there's a guy over there</font>

239
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rob Thomas all right he's one of the</font>

240
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,640
uptick

241
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:29,650
I think the founder of team covering

242
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:31,060
right he noticed in conversations he and

243
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:34,329
I are having my and man many many years

244
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're noticing as the criminals</font>

245
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:38,950
were coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monetary in other words</font>

246
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,620
we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have people who go out there</font>

247
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,120
and hack for fun you can make tons of

248
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,280
money at this and so people hack for

249
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,470
profit they you know break in a networks

250
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:48,790
profit they'd austral profit and then

251
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,530
when we're watching after a couple years

252
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:52,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're notice in certain things and one</font>

253
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things we noticed was that these</font>

254
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,719
these cycles these cycles that go

255
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:58,240
through like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance dos attacks</font>

256
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,280
and this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas right</font>

257
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,170
now you go watch up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people said you</font>

258
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,689
know four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago there was lots of</font>

259
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:07,000
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> dos attacks and then things happen</font>

260
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:09,190
and we had a down cycle so you have this

261
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,870
down cycle going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

262
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:13,060
have dos attacks on the rise so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

263
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,740
more more dos attacks now with the dos

264
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,520
attacks are different all right and

265
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,710
because what happens is you have lots of

266
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright with those</font>

267
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:24,220
lots of problems going on to community

268
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,570
mitigates the problem then what happens

269
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,490
is the criminals go out there and they

270
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:28,660
do research and development and they

271
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do it better than the white</font>

272
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">hack people so the black cats are better</font>

273
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,840
at the rd they come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> better tools</font>

274
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,910
and they're back at it again so what

275
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,860
happens with service<font color="#E5E5E5"> our security is to</font>

276
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,209
be mindful<font color="#E5E5E5"> that here you're looking at</font>

277
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:42,250
different techniques you may say well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

278
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have this problem right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now well</font>

279
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,300
this problem right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now could be for many</font>

280
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:48,070
different reasons all right and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

281
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,079
the reasons it could be is because we're

282
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:51,610
in a trough right now compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

283
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">business and it doesn't mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

284
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:54,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to get hit it just means at</font>

285
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:57,430
this moment of time there is any

286
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,280
motivation or the bad guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies</font>

287
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,260
in there at the go after you right so

288
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,120
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some of the things to</font>

289
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">be mindful of that even though you're</font>

290
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,440
seeing it here you may not face it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

291
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,510
the preparation beforehand with a lot of

292
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">these techniques is not capital</font>

293
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,650
intensive and it's not like you know big

294
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,390
labor intensive a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font>

295
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:18,970
techniques are actually you know you

296
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:20,470
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know some time to do on it you</font>

297
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">can get it deployed and you then you're</font>

298
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:24,190
ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and it's on standby it's</font>

299
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,290
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system of defense ready to go in</font>

300
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,150
case you need it trying to build these

301
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:29,500
techniques like a romantic remote

302
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:33,310
trigger black hole in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle of a</font>

303
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">DOS attack is very finicky you know and</font>

304
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:36,349
i know i've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> on big telco providers</font>

305
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,390
before in the mid

306
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:39,710
dos attack and we've actually deployed

307
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,230
remote trigger black hole in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle</font>

308
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a DOS attack and it can be done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

309
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:45,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's rather it would be much</font>

310
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,700
better that you actually have it

311
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,170
prepared and then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get hit with</font>

312
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,090
a dos attack you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can just</font>

313
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:53,180
drop the packets at the edge of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

314
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:54,530
network or send it over to a sinkhole do

315
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,329
whatever with it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know don't wait for</font>

316
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:59,209
the attack now we're all this stuff is

317
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:01,670
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from is coming from experience</font>

318
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:03,170
right so this is actually we throw the

319
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,670
slides out there to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nsp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sec</font>

320
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:05,750
community and other peers out there and

321
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,640
you look through it and they say what

322
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,620
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what about that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

323
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,910
you know if they have time with it so

324
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's actually come from from the</font>

325
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:14,209
experience with it and what we're doing

326
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">over here is doing the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> powering parts</font>

327
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,130
that's what this presentation is about

328
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:22,010
the other thing to keep where this is

329
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:24,620
coming from is a 40 45 at the 40 2020

330
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:26,600
goal the 40 40 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> year old</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean Dolan</font>

331
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,950
who actually can't come here much

332
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,480
anymore because it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not funded in his</font>

333
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,850
new job at department homeland defense

334
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,800
but when he came here a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when he</font>

335
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:36,530
was doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> MSP set I'll service our</font>

336
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,719
security stuff at<font color="#CCCCCC"> SBC he was noticed in</font>

337
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,040
this pattern the pattern being that you

338
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,930
know whenever we get these passes in

339
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,240
these upgrades you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know Microsoft Azure</font>

340
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:46,339
Patch Tuesday that forty percent of the

341
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,080
his customer base you know goes and

342
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,970
upgrades right away another forty

343
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,470
percent takes time to look at it and

344
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:53,330
figure out what to do with it needs a

345
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,490
nudge in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and wealth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great but you always</font>

346
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that twenty percent that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will never</font>

347
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:59,090
ever do<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything and these are the</font>

348
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,890
computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> get infected and violating get</font>

349
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,930
bodied and used in criminal activities

350
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:05,449
and that twenty percent is really really

351
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:07,910
hard to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> care of and that twenty</font>

352
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,190
percent is a growing number the net has

353
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:12,050
grown dramatically and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20-percent what</font>

354
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,970
used to be millions and computers when

355
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,189
Sean was first noticed in this is you

356
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,110
know tens of millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> computers and then</font>

357
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,900
the devices like your ham phones and you

358
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:22,850
know the all over devices so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this</font>

359
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,500
this problem set is gone that twenty

360
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,180
percent they talked about other

361
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,100
customers who just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care and will</font>

362
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,420
never respond and never patch is going

363
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,190
to keep on growing which means the

364
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,849
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of machines available to the bad</font>

365
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:36,470
guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to continue to increase</font>

366
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright continue to increase with each</font>

367
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,130
of those devices have a more and more

368
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:42,740
first hog of the sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets that</font>

369
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:45,290
can throw on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so and</font>

370
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,940
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them go on mobile which makes it</font>

371
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,430
even more interesting with it so this

372
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem set this 40 40 20 rule</font>

373
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:52,459
is something that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be with us</font>

374
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">for quite a long time because there's</font>

375
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:56,240
not much that people can dent into this

376
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have looked at this Microsoft</font>

377
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,380
looks of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> people cite this 40 40 20</font>

378
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,089
rule and this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big dangers</font>

379
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:03,680
that we have to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

380
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,350
we have our networks as a resilient as

381
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,819
possible alright so the walk through

382
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,140
these techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going to walk</font>

383
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,970
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> them there's a quick summer we</font>

384
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,490
would do with it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the</font>

385
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:16,760
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I met</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nola enemy as</font>

386
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,950
part of whether whether the steering

387
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,930
committee puts me on a program committee

388
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:23,240
or not one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

389
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,160
doing is we<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed this past year that</font>

390
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need do two more refresh of service</font>

391
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,170
of our security topics and nanog so what

392
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,589
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see is one or two good</font>

393
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,360
solid speakers coming into nanog so

394
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:37,550
those of you are here the first time

395
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,930
come on back<font color="#CCCCCC"> again because we're going</font>

396
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have solid topics in there if you</font>

397
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,260
can't make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> then watch the sessions</font>

398
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,390
when we put it online since<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

399
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,649
stuff is videotaped and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

400
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,050
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chance go back to the other</font>

401
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:49,520
security talk type in security as part

402
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,870
of the keyword search or topics and look

403
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to some of the old videos that we have</font>

404
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,930
because it talks about some of the

405
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,550
threat vectors so some of the first

406
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:57,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we're going to do over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

407
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,540
neuron<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to get sessions on the</font>

408
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,550
new threat vectors in so so you can

409
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,400
understand what is the threat out there

410
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,510
right so how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you gauge a threat in</font>

411
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,120
today's threat because a threat

412
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,319
environment has changed is all changed

413
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,880
and we want to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information out</font>

414
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,640
to you so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take that back to your</font>

415
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,930
organization's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so we set this</font>

416
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,189
up in such a way where I put this

417
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,449
executive summary I'm going to flip

418
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:20,600
through this executive summary you talk

419
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,950
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these techniques and it's in here</font>

420
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,270
so that way you can cut and paste and

421
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:24,890
put in your slides you can go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

422
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:27,170
boss and say here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to do</font>

423
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,420
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 slides here's what we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

424
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,550
do so number number one you tell your

425
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,290

is ready to go written down and I mean

429
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,640
written down in paper not like on<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

don't wait until the last minute to go

437

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not a good thing to do all right</font>

disadvantage all right

444
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:08,119
example way back in slammer 2003 those

445
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,650
networks are apart of MSP sec they're

446
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,720
able to recover really quick those

447
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:12,829
networks are not part of NSB sec they're

448
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,779
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> clueless that they were down</font>

449
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:17,510
there is a direct differentiation

450
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:18,710
between how to plug in to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

453
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really important to be able to</font>

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,660
invest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those communities to plug into</font>

them I not<font color="#E5E5E5"> DBA there's a phone system</font>

456
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,459
out there that knocks use only a ton of

457
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,140
a system number and then the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

459
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,500
use this for conference bridges we use

460
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,150
this for operational security many

463
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:45,440
phone system so how do you call<font color="#E5E5E5"> dtp</font>

464
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,270
person at the other service provider

465
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,370
well this is a way of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way</font>

466
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,319
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> that phone rings you know you pick</font>

467
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,910
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that phone what you know and somebody</font>

468
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,200

Batman film<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll be really cool</font>

470
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,330
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it's a red phone and it</font>

471
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:57,860
beats and says when that phone rings

472
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,020
pick it up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's somebody you</font>

through and review your point protection

00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,270
how do you protect your routers and

switches and host of the inside your own

479
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,819
infrastructure making sure your

480
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:16,819
infrastructure can't be taken down right

right to determine what type of packets

come into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network your boundary is</font>

488
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:35,030
a is a national boundary that a ton of a

489
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,370
system boundary is something that you

490
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:38,960
have control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over all right you just</font>

491
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:41,209
don't say I accept any pack in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

492
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,890
and me who lives in other side of world

493
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,570
you know I have a right to some attack

494
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,429
of wherever I want to that isn't it

495
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:47,899
explicit right your ton of a system

496
00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:49,640
boundary is an autonomous system border

497
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,740
control so you have to say here's my

498
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,179
policy here's how I enforce my policy

499
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,890
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of packets I allow</font>

500
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:56,840
through is those order pack as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I drop</font>

501
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:58,520
and you can determine that sort of thing

502
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,899
whether other<font color="#CCCCCC"> one have network you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

503
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,270
whether it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> service by our enterprise</font>

504
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">remote trigger black hole this is</font>

505
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:06,110
probably one of the number one

506
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,880
techniques that we use out in the net

507
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,189
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll walk through how this works</font>

508
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,320
motor go black hole is used in BGP and

509
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:15,470
just taken the packets and route into

510
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,169
null 0 is what we do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it alright so</font>

511
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:19,090
you drop them to null 0 and

512
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:21,370
drops it<font color="#E5E5E5"> down in the big bucket it was</font>

513
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,810
so this tool is probably used<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

514
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:24,850
the most out in the net to go out there

515
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">and drop dos attacks and dos attacks or</font>

516
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">in action sinkholes instead of dropping</font>

517
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,629
the packet take the packet to a section

518
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:36,040
of my network and then analyze it

519
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,540
because the packets coming in it's an

520
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,550
attack in progress I can see what's

521
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:41,409
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on with and sinkholes i'll talk</font>

522
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,190
about basics and codes but some networks

523
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:47,020
have taken sink holes to really wild

524
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,100
architectural innovation<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean some of</font>

525
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,990
the innovation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people are down in</font>

526
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">sinkholes and now we wanted a topics</font>

527
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,540
that go in there and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can get</font>

528
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of these guys to come in and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

529
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,920
how they deployed sinkholes in their

530
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,720
network right over over the years so

531
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:00,430
cinco's is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our key analysis</font>

532
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,290
techniques you take something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like for</font>

533
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,970
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> conficker how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

534
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">very calm factor right tomorrow i'll</font>

535
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,340
talk about conflict is part of

536
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">contractor working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group all the</font>

537
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:11,340
conflict is dumped into singles right so

538
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,450
understanding what sinkholes are and

539
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:15,939
understanding the multiple tool abuses

540
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:17,290
with it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is inhabited pre</font>

541
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,000
deployed inside your network gives you

542
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,850
options because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what these tools</font>

543
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,350
are is about given options you've heard

544
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">this before i hope you've heard this</font>

545
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:29,500
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> but bc p38 you know if the packet</font>

546
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,120
comes into you and its source address is

547
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,620
it something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> said you can route</font>

548
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,050
to you then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should drop it check</font>

549
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,129
that source address<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright and there's</font>

550
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,629
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different techniques out</font>

551
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:40,180
there for doing this there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

552
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,560
unicast RPF and acls as a whole

553
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,510
multitude of different techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

554
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,250
technologies you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use to do source</font>

555
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:47,379
address validation as it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> into your</font>

556
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,270
network don't allow spoofing to come in

forcement things prefix filters there's

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,350
a i'll be covering priesthood prefix

<font color="#CCCCCC">filtering and kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> russian a bit</font>

561
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,879
through it because it's a bunch to it

562
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:02,470
there's a tutorial<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dan ons ago</font>

563

in New York that you can pull up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

564
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,070
goes too in-depth and prefix filtering

565
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,990
prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fulton is really incorrect in</font>

566
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,210
critical because bgp glues us all

567
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:14,380

the black hole got leaked out the rest

of world and what happened collateral

through BB GP speaking routers spammers

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:42,220
like bgp speaking routers so hacker go

582
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,810
out there and scan some of the ssh

583

scanner that goes on<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there is a</font>

bad guys buy and sell them but the bad

586
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,840
guys use them for spam they don't use

587

them to take out the net you take 12<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ooh bad stuff so</font>

591
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,690
prefix felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> an important total</font>

592
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:06,100
visibility total situational awareness

593
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,860
understanding what's going on on your

594
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">network all the time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tons of</font>

595
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:13,110
data out there that's built into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

596
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:15,490
network gear that you can tap into

597
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:17,560
everything from of course you've hold

598
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,870
for net flow and talk net flow but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

599
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,370
many people ever thought that end ntp is

600
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,840
a visibility tool everybody's think of

601
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,810
network town protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a visibility</font>

602
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,720
tool right this guy Peter laughs<font color="#CCCCCC"> berg</font>

603
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:30,639
who's one of the industry you know

604
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,020
gadfly personalities on the net but one

605
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,270
time he came up to be about five years

606
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,460
ago but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not eight years ago he said hey</font>

607
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,470
you can use MTP as a security tool as

608
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:40,780
scratching my head goes into lab starts

609
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:43,120
doing stress out there and very very

610
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">much MVP jitter monitoring on their</font>

611
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,320
shows it SLA tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so there's</font>

612
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,629
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of visibility tools you can do with</font>

613
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,450
you do on your network right so that's

614
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:56,230
the total visibility with it as a bonus

615
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,030
like there's more out there so some of

616
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,760
the stuff will bring in for instance

617
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:03,160
quarantine wall garden techniques if you

618
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,710
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer and that customer has</font>

619
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:07,570
infected computer in the past people

620
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,760
said it was is way too expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

621
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,710
clean that computer<font color="#CCCCCC"> off but now there</font>

622
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,440
are techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> different providers</font>

623
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,080
have figured out<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost effectively how to</font>

624
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:19,510
start the remediation process<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

625
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,540
so comcast last week announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

626
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:25,570
they're a bit right and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more out</font>

627
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,100
there right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cox says there's quest as</font>

628
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:29,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">there so we want to bring these guys in</font>

629
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,020
and say here's how our techniques work

630
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:34,389
here's how we do it each of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

631
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:36,700
different it fits aligns towards their

632
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,440
business practice but<font color="#E5E5E5"> its own is that a</font>

633
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">quarantine war garden where I can</font>

634
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,640
identify I know where the bad you know

635
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:43,760
infected computers are how do I help my

636
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,270
customer who's been

637
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">eyes get cleaned up right so you know</font>

638
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,450
there's techniques like that there's

639
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:51,889
core hiding techniques where you can

640
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:53,180
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ojai jacour do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

641
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,490
everybody to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything you or you</font>

642
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:58,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">can hide you core right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these are</font>

643
00:22:55,490 --> 00:23:01,040
to either to a point where they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

644
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,479
everybody agrees to it or their vendor

645
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,770
specific which is why they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not up</font>

646
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,910
here right now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're getting to a</font>

647
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:06,470
point where there's some of these

648
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,330
techniques are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting to where this</font>

649
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,640
vendor in<font color="#CCCCCC"> neutral</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in other words you can</font>

650
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,139
do at anybody's equipment and everybody

651
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,600
agrees to it but there's other technique

652
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:16,280
so when you start with this this gets

653
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,899
you started then there's more things to

654
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,220
look at and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a look at</font>

655
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,600
depends on your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> and your</font>

656
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,540
service you know what what you have on

657
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:25,699
your network so let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

658
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,780
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one compare your knock it's</font>

659
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most important one</font>

660
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:31,520
everybody has a knock I hope everybody

661
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,290
has a knock whether it's a centralized

662
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,150
not if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really not big displays on</font>

663
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:38,750
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> pcs whatever you have somebody to</font>

664
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:40,970
move ones in network and you know no

665
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,620
knock is perfect the thing is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

666
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:43,940
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on improving the processes</font>

667
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:49,040
and this is part of improving the

668
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:50,600
processes right so inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NOC you</font>

669
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,909
know you need to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

670
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,889
security awareness now some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say</font>

671
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,570
oh you have a separate security team or

672
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:58,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">integrated security team and this is a</font>

673
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">question I always gets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> onto me so my</font>

674
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,879
security operations center be the same

675
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,110
as a network operations center so it's

676
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,640
all depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your business</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you got to</font>

677
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:07,010
see what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business looks like I've</font>

678
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,140
seen very successful big networks where

679
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,120
there are security people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not</font>

680
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,770
people with one in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same I've seen</font>

681
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,429
other successful businesses where there

682
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:18,410
were two distinct teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so it all</font>

683
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,630
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your business with it of how</font>

684
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,240
you put it together but the key thing is

685
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,520
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have people inside your operations</font>

686
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,380
who no operational security who practice

687
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,330
operational security where does the dos

688
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,800
attacks get escalated what are the guys

689
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,840
who practice who the guys to care about

690
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:36,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools these are things you need with</font>

691
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,730
it right so and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of constant</font>

692
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,650
improving every time the incident

693
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:41,540
happens don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay incidence</font>

694
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:42,890
over and forget what happened go back

695
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:45,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">and do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> post-mortem and figure out how</font>

696
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:46,940
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make things better because it's</font>

697
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,949
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen again there's a cycle</font>

698
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,140
fullness it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen again</font>

699
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:55,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and what you want to prepare for</font>

700
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,420
is is in it as it happens again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

701
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:57,170
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation there's not a</font>

702
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,940
presentation

703
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:01,430
done where I talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

704
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:05,150
with conversions there's a talk I give

705
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:06,590
in the Juniper mindset<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I say long</font>

live the internet the internet died two

707

anymore what we have is a global public

709
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:15,140
munication system that rides on IP and

710
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,910
if you look at it convergence has

711
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,190
happened and we didn't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

712
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,440
when we something happens today tomorrow

713
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:22,970
more conversions going to happen so

714
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,250
today on your network you may not have

715
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,500
emergency life life reporting services

716
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:29,270
that the FCC requires reports for

717
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,180
because its life dependent services

718
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:34,129
today but tomorrow you probably will all

719
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:36,080
right and on those services you know

720
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:37,670
that go down you know people's lives are

721
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,379
at stake I can't pick up the phone and

722
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:41,930
call 911 because your service is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

723
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">tossed right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a serious sort of</font>

724
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:45,920
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what's happened with</font>

725
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:47,570
convergence right all the regulatory

726
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,610
stuff that happened in old telco will is

727
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,560
coming on all the inner people and this

728
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:53,120
is changing the way you have to think so

729
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,710
while we have that twenty percent of the

730
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,090
badness that keeps on growing those that

731
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,040
have conversions to happen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as</font>

732
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,050
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's more critical so you can't</font>

733
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">just let this stuff to say oh well I my</font>

734
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,680
dice attack the das attack is over let

735
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,240
me go do my next job you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta look at</font>

736
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,520
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> can I make things better because</font>

737
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,960
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come again it's just part</font>

738
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,820
of what we have because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want</font>

739
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,830
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> up there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say okay you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

740
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,120
practice I do and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

741
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:16,210
like the fire department going to a fire

742
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:18,800
and say oh how's the fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> engine work</font>

743
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:20,270
you have to practice these things you

744
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:22,280
know throw some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in the lab you</font>

745
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:26,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">know can be done a lot go back to the</font>

746
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:29,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">original 2002 now there was a Chris and</font>

747
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:31,100
Brian right so I got a man and they

748
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,500
taught<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's how we do remote trigger a</font>

749
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,570
black hole at verizon business and then

750
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,700
you know the day before chris says oh we

751
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,770
should demonstrate this very go get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

752
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,120
us some routers so I go over and grab a

753
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,460
whole bunch of routers and they set up a

754
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,719
demonstration in all of us it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

755
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,160
demonstration<font color="#E5E5E5"> we shut up in the front we</font>

756
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,900
had like five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six different routers</font>

757
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,920
and there were small routers and you was

758
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,290
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

759
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,660
technique works so you can do this sort

760
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:56,300
of thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and practice it in a</font>

761
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:58,100
lab before we get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network all</font>

762
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,090
right the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with firemen all</font>

763
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,679
right you know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to practice</font>

764
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:02,629
practice practice before you go to the

765
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,780
fire you can't wait you know can't train

766
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:07,760
on the scene of the fire yeah I got to

767
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:09,260
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the methodology around this you</font>

768
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,680
don't wait until the<font color="#E5E5E5"> merge enci to say</font>

769
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:13,230
okay what do I do

770
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,580
all right you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta not only drill but</font>

771
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:17,160
you got to have a method behind the

772
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,320
madness so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of many different</font>

773
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">approaches right and this is approach</font>

774
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,460
that you know you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can deep dive</font>

775
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,510
and drill on it where you go through and

776
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,400
the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do is prepare</font>

777
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,230
preparation part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when an</font>

778
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,390
incident happens so you did like use a

779
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">DOS attack you got to find out okay what</font>

780
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,890
type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dos attack isn't is it</font>

781
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:37,980
saturating my bandwidth is a state or en

782
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:39,900
dos attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an ICP is a tcp what is it</font>

783
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:42,270
then I got to classify<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay where's this</font>

784
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,280
coming from who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> captain what impact</font>

785
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:46,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">does happen then trace it back where's</font>

786
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,060
it coming in from right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I have</font>

787
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:50,520
enough information say now I go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

788
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,770
and react and how do I react which tool

789
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,300
is appropriate to react because you have

790
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">different types</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of dos attacks out there</font>

791
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,720
and there's different techniques you

792
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:59,730
want to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all right if how are</font>

793
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,470
you go to react with it because there's

794
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">das attacks out there that we see dos</font>

795
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,780
attacks of being designed to trick you

796
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:08,730
oh let me go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and do drop</font>

797
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,860
everybody's source address to a source

798
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:12,780
address drum because I got you know 20

799
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,760
different source addresses that I got as

800
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,649
part of the sauce attack and I don't

801
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,750
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the source addresses I don't</font>

802
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,460
notice the source address is equal<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo</font>

803
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:22,320
and google and microsoft and all the

804
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:24,600
critical sites that goes there spoofed

805
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,790
the common in a spooked so that actually

806
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">real sites but I go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there into a</font>

807
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,030
source address black hole now I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

808
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,639
knocked<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all my other customers from</font>

809
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:34,110
going to Google Microsoft and Yahoo you

810
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,150
know I now go my customers calling me up

811
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,669
and we've seen those sort of tricks that

812
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bad guys were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so this</font>

813
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,580
is why it's having some of the method

814
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,240
and not just automatically throw this

815
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,310
tool black right so the methodology

816
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,480
behind is is really really important

817
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:53,280
with it so mitigation communities as i

818
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,430
said before our best offenses ourselves

819
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:59,010
so there's a bunch of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there all</font>

820
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">right and there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more out there that</font>

821
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:03,810
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

822
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:05,550
mitigation communities and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm just</font>

823
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to drive into first one like if</font>

824
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,580
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had not part of any any how many</font>

825
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">people here is where is a hands how many</font>

826
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:14,820
people here are part of MSP sec okay so

827
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,350
this is this is you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a lot of</font>

828
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">good new people here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we want to get</font>

829
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:21,540
you there tomorrow<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the same time</font>

830
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,100
whatever the rooms<font color="#CCCCCC"> fasb seckbach detail</font>

831
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,850
how many people have got their home

832
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,189
networks

833
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,159
set up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DC old at least anybody home</font>

834
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,110
network setup oh one other person detail

835
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a good tool that anybody who's not</font>

836
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:36,059
into logs and doing forensics one

837
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:38,419
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got what DeShields is that</font>

838
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:41,100
it shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that community defense works</font>

839
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:42,840
right you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> take your home network you</font>

840
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,668
can send your long as you send whatever

841
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,309
scanning your network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it into a</font>

842
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:49,169
collective IDP firewall log analyzer and

843
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:51,059
you get these charts<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of them and</font>

844
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:53,549
they get alerts about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> scanning you</font>

845
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:55,139
and then if anybody wants to find out

846
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:57,870
what sort of badness is hitting your

847
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:00,659
system right then you go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and</font>

848
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:02,549
you subscribe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fight back so for</font>

849
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:04,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">instance it's interesting you know I'm</font>

850
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:06,059

907
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:11,580

908
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:13,530
trust level is that me as a network

anybody see these addresses in your list

921
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:41,280
can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your net flow logs we're</font>

922
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:43,139
exchange and information that if if

923
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">warriors were in the room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they would</font>

924
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,500
have a heart attack because they feel

925
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:47,639
like oh my goodness while you're sharing

926
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,260
this information that's confidential

927
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,929
information you shouldn't be sharing

928
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:53,820
that but you need to share that to

929
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:55,799
collaborate with each other right so

930
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:58,590
that's why there's this trust vector

931
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:00,030
where you have people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who vet you in CA</font>

932
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:02,010
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know this person I've worked with</font>

933
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,240
this person this is put somebody who is

934
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,040
not going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blabber in their mouth</font>

935
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,570
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> press over the sort of</font>

936
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">information we exchanged with each other</font>

937
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,530
so we can defend ourselves right so

938
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,299
that's where the veteran comes in with

939
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,399
it so that's why I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> into groups like</font>

940
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:16,650
this putting the black dot on coming to

941
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,720
you know a tutorial like this going to

942
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,250
SP sec Boff<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

943
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,200
the halls if you see a black dot on them

944
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:24,660
just go up and say hey hi you don't

945
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,400
introduce yourself and this is the sort

946
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,650
of thing we need to do you know to go

947
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,210
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build the trust</font>

948
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:31,890
relationships out there so we can defend

949
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,960
ourselves because this sort of thing

950
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:36,090
happens all the time service what I a is

951
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,080
get with hit with the dots attack if the

952

thoughts attack that's club<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

953
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,250
collateral damage<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other words one</font>

954
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:44,490
customers getting hit but he's getting

00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,880
das attack well those 40 Meg's don't

958

just disappear

959
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,400
those 40 bags go all the way down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

960
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:58,350
router that's supporting that 10 meg

961
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,080
that one big connection well whereas the

962
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,090
other 39 Meg's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right well that</font>

963
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,919
router that PE router starts dropping

964
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,260
them well that PE router may not be

965
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">strong powerful enough to drop and now</font>

966
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:12,510
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the connections connected</font>

967
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:15,530
to that PE PE router<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop in connections</font>

968
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:19,110
so you have collateral damage<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so</font>

969
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:21,210
40 you know is a big number<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys help me stop this attack</font>

975
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:33,149
here's the destination address can

976
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:35,609
everybody stop all packets going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

977
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:37,350
destination address and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say</font>

978
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:39,720
yeah no problem you start working it

979

980
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,810
the source addresses give me source

981
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,850
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is food and</font>

982
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">people look to interface blogs look to</font>

983
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:48,600
the flow logs<font color="#CCCCCC"> fishing you information</font>

984
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:50,638
right so then you get this information

985
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,469
feeding into you and you start working

986
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,450
the attack they figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out okay how do I</font>

source address what botnet is it coming

990
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,319
from anybody spot the control channel

991
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,089
let's go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the controller for the</font>

992
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,250
botnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we go take off the</font>

993
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:08,940
control of the botnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then cut off</font>

994
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:11,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the head of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the botnet right so um this</font>

995
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:15,140
is typical typical sort of collaboration

996
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:17,399
happens in sp set community<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so</font>

997
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,890
then this is this whole realm about

998
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,510
operational trust where you gotta trust

999
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">your people you know the meets</font>

1000
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:24,570
expectations it's like trusting your

1001
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:26,370
buddy behind you and your wingman or

1002
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:27,990
whatever right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is sort of trust</font>

1003
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happens and this is the sort of</font>

1004
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:31,140
thing unfortunately this is how I want

1005
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,400
to keep the internet glued together this

1006
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,710
how we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep global telecoms</font>

1007
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,290
together because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to</font>

1008
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">really stop the bad guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right the</font>

1009
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:40,680

1010
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:42,810
botnet then they go build another button

1011
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,310
act because remember that 40 40 20 rule

1012
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,110
that twenty percent is always going to

1013
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">be there the bad guys always going to</font>

1019
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:58,830
do that internationally with an

<font color="#E5E5E5">international legal system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's not</font>

00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:09,810
the backbones we got to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

be perfect all right it's not designed

1031
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:23,009
to solve all the problems for

1032
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,509
operational security there are other

1033
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:25,830
groups fortunately other groups go out

1034
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:29,190
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their specialization groups</font>

1035

autonomous system number colon and then

1128
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,420
some number and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people do is</font>

1129

right so like MTT America they've run it

1131
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:08,040
off the asterisk system right so so you

1132
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,250
can call anybody in their company

1133
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:14,670
through I not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ba right so you can go</font>

1134
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:16,410
to that extreme with it and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font>

1135
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,150
worked in the middle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sniper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so here</font>

1136
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have a lots of das ich ooze with the</font>

1137
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:21,570
slammer big stress on the net<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're</font>

1138
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:24,750
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to each other on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I nachdi be a</font>

1139
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:27,210
conference bridge why because I knock

1140
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:28,530
DBA is in your network and you control

1141
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:30,720
the backbone and

1142
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:33,690
it kind of all just kind of works quite

1143
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,029
well you get statistics don't work

1144
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:37,620
who is around some of other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

1145
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,180
packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearinghouse it look for the PCH</font>

1146
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,799
they can give statistics with it and we

1147
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,020
got presentations that given on that or

1148
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,820
you can look up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ritva but one of the</font>

1149
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:47,970
interesting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they show is</font>

1150
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:50,220
that the because there's a consistent

1151
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,660
number of calls every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day in other words</font>

1152
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:55,709
people talk to each other use that act

1153
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,930
DBA to call all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time right and so</font>

1154
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:00,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">that number is everyday but the duration</font>

1155
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,220
of the call increase is correlated when

1156
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,900
there's stuff happened and I'm net so

1157
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:06,230
when stuff has happened on a net the

1158
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">duration of the call increases by x 10</font>

1159
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,020
so no it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same group of people</font>

1160
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:11,460
people who keep in the neck glued

1161
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,660
together talking to each other it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

1162
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,120
of how they talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1163
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,339
phone rings somebody I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk to</font>

1166
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:23,850

irate customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is yelling at me or</font>

1168
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:27,180

1172
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,860
when there's a problem I think up the

1173
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:35,970
phone on ring I put people on bridge and

1174
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,160
we work in a problem together and you're

1175
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:40,980
on longer so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on our</font>

1176
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,730
DBA you go to website is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to</font>

1177
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:47,220
set up these days it's um you know PCH

1178
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:48,870
net this past<font color="#CCCCCC"> Patrick fallstrom was out</font>

1179
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,669
industry this is a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of his nephew</font>

1180
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:52,080
back when he plugged in design<font color="#CCCCCC"> rock BB</font>

1181
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:54,120
asus<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they kind of use that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1182
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:57,810
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward and getting</font>

1183
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,730
hooked up these days with it so and is

1184
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:01,470
being used as a bunch like<font color="#E5E5E5"> d geeks and</font>

1185
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stockholm you know they got a whole</font>

1186
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:04,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of phones there's there's a bunch</font>

1187
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,390
of exchange points you go to the site<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1188
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,129
show you which exchange points<font color="#CCCCCC"> or using</font>

1189
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,990
it so a lot of exchange points are using

1190
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:14,780
it for like troubleshooting on exchange

1191
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:17,540
point work so ionic DBA point protection

1192
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:20,460
this is protecting the router itself

1193
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:22,050
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

1194
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:23,430

1195
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,080
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outside world because these</font>

1197
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:29,700
break into routers and it's surprising

1198
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:32,100
you know probably about<font color="#E5E5E5"> once every other</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">found this intelligence because some</font>

1202
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,060
juniper router got broken into over here

1203
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not controlled by juniper</font>

1204
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,880
networks but they're calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> me up</font>

1205
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,030
because they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

out

1207
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:46,920
you know how to contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that party to</font>

1208
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:49,770
say hey your router's home<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you know</font>

1209
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,940
and criminals especially the commercial

1210
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:52,860
criminals want to go after<font color="#CCCCCC"> these routers</font>

1211
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,600
they find ways of using them for their

1212
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,190
to support the criminal activity

1213
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,140
everything from route and tunnels

1214
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:59,940
through it<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up tunnel connections to</font>

1215
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,950
using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to inject bgp routes for like</font>

1216
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,110
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 minutes and then DJ you know</font>

1217
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:06,750
and pull with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routes so they had</font>

1218
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:09,270
withdrawal specific routes right so they

1219
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,160
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> puff stand behind it so they're</font>

1220
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,810
after these routers they like to do with

1221
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so is important for people to</font>

1222
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:16,650
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like really pay attention to it</font>

1223
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:19,800
and pay attention from a holistic man

1224
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">standpoint let's just say okay I just</font>

1225
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,060
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it vty access-list on it</font>

1226
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:26,190
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it from a whole a</font>

1227
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,650
holistic perspective of you sitting at

1228
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:30,060
home or sitting here how many people

1229
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">here this is interesting how many people</font>

1230
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:37,020
here are currently logged on to a router

1231
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:38,399
in the room hoodie is 1234 here right so

1232
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,490
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to think of yourself in this</font>

1233
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,080
room as you're in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room and look at</font>

1234
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:45,899
the whole path between you and the swim

1235
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:50,370
all the way to your router's right and

1236
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,630
is this whole path secure right and

1237
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,980
that's a sort of security we're talking

1238
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:57,330
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> lapointe protection with it is</font>

1239
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,250
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and and here at nanog right</font>

1240
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:00,960
and your router is back at home are they

1241
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:04,800
they secure so you start everything from

1242
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,480
the ssh on the router VT y axis list

1243
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,340
you're talking about looking at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path</font>

1244
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,310
what do you use to connect up you know

1245
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,630
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all like for instance um juniper</font>

1246
00:44:11,310 --> 00:44:13,799
routers telnet it's not configured

1247
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:15,840
automatically you have to manually

1248
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:18,810
configure it you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we rather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1249
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,600
configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSH right for example you know</font>

1250
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:25,680
so go encrypted path that sort of thing

1251
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:27,990
but as you do this stuff you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots</font>

1252
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices are using triple a in</font>

1253
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:30,569
other words are you just putting

1254
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,670
passwords on the router or using some

1255
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:35,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">sort of triple-a to it if you do in</font>

1256
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,140
triple-a are you using you know triple-a

1257
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:38,460
that has the whole path secure how do

1258
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,930
you secure the whole path with it

1259
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,000
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people throw up radius</font>

1260
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,440
well radius does it but radius when you

1261
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,940
look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for radius of its most</font>

1262
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,740
default version if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't do some</font>

1263
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,090
certain tricks you can have commands

1264
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,799
going into clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they clean the</font>

1265
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:51,620
router<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the server over here so look</font>

1266
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,420
at the whole holistic part of it right

1267
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:57,240
are you using win time passwords

1268
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so one time password is used to be</font>

1269
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,419
like oh wow they're expensive but one

1270
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">time password systems are very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DD</font>

1271
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:05,549
these days right so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the all these</font>

1272
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:07,530
sort of things add up for protecting

1273
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:10,380
routers because they're there<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

1274
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:12,569
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> it triple a service have you</font>

1275
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:15,540
checked<font color="#CCCCCC"> the path to the triple a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

1276
00:45:12,569 --> 00:45:16,770
because a bad guy knows you know says

1277
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:18,599
okay how do I go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service</font>

1278
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:21,869
provider let me boss their triple a

1279
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:23,430
service all right what happens to your

1280
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:25,819
router when you replace server

1281
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,500
disappears oh I default on my default

1282
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:30,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well how often do you change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1283
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,730
default passwords on your router how

1284
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,010
many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have def your company right</font>

1285
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,270
do you change every time somebody leaves

1286
00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:38,520
a company's you go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and change</font>

1287
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:40,530
you know yeah md5 keys and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1288
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,720
passwords and y'all you know routes and

1289
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:44,940
things like that do you change no I mean

1290
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,618
you're supposed to but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1291
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">just too tedious to do that sort of</font>

1292
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:51,240
stuff right so you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1293
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:55,200
information like that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be out there</font>

1294
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:56,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the marketplace all right the bag got</font>

1295
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,890
marketplace all right so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

1296
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,359
out to take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it you know doing</font>

1297
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:01,859
things like distributing you to triple-a

1298
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:07,290
servers in different parts of network so

1299
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:10,910
it's you know out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so tack X plus</font>

1300
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:14,220
and other things out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

1301
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:16,470
the other thing to look at is is you

1302
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:21,328
know look at your protection on your

1303
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:24,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">router you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco are a CL juniper</font>

1304
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:25,859
ll 0 filters right I don't know what

1305
00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:27,420
Huawei<font color="#CCCCCC"> annakut all uses but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

1306
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:29,520
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> your equivalent you don't look these</font>

1307
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:32,400
filters or how you set these filters up

1308
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:35,670
on the router and audit them in a year

1309
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,410
and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right don't just</font>

1310
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,270
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I got certain protections on</font>

1311
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:40,799
there and I don't look at what's being

1312
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:44,460
hit on my router as a matter of fact

1313
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:46,559
looking at the drops off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these lists</font>

1314
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,930
give you really good intelligence on the

1315
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:54,299
visibility part all right a good example

1316
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:58,020
of this back in two thousand there's one

1317
00:46:54,299 --> 00:46:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">network who is also a TV channel that</font>

1318
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:01,799
was new they're going to get hit with a

1319
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:03,119
DOS attack and the reason why they knew

1320
00:47:01,799 --> 00:47:05,520
they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get hit with a das attack</font>

1321
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,210
was to tools they took their<font color="#CCCCCC"> host</font>

1322
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,390
protection<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACL</font>

1323
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:13,570
they logged all the drops so then permit

1324
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:17,680
permit permit deny any TCT deny any IP

1325
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:19,869
log<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that syslog and</font>

1326
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,359
they put in an mrt<font color="#E5E5E5"> g graph data graph</font>

1327
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:24,339
and said<font color="#CCCCCC"> every day here's my how many</font>

1328
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:27,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are knocking on my door here's</font>

1329
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:29,830
how many drops<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get every day then i'll</font>

1330
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:32,349
send one month before the elections in

1331
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">two thousand the u.s. elections it</font>

1332
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:40,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">spiked it when multiplied times ten and</font>

1333
00:47:35,490 --> 00:47:41,830
it stayed there multiply x 10 right and

1334
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:43,210
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tell them was somebody's</font>

1335
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:44,859
really paying attention to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

1336
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:45,910
somebody keeps on scanning<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network</font>

1337
00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:49,470
trying to figure out what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in</font>

1338
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:52,750
network now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> did it cost them a</font>

1339
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:55,890
configuration on the router pump it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

1340
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:59,670
the syslog mr<font color="#E5E5E5"> TG pump it into a graph</font>

1341
00:47:55,890 --> 00:48:02,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright we get these scans all the time</font>

1342
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,720
hitting our routers all right and this

1343
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,790
is valuable telemetry information and

1344
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,200
it's stuff you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at because</font>

1345
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:09,700
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only look at says here's how</font>

1346
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,680
many here's how much knocking on the

1347
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:13,299
door happens but what type are knocking

1348
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:15,490
on the door am<font color="#CCCCCC"> i getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it with</font>

1349
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,440
tellement<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH oh they just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shipped the</font>

1350
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,000
protocol not are looking for radius well

1351
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,980
now they're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for why are you</font>

1352
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for idiots or now they're</font>

1353
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:24,460
sending these other packets to me that

1354
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,410
you shouldn't send all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting</font>

1355
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know different ports that are not</font>

1356
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:30,098
you know it tells you information and

1357
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,629
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> information goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through and said I</font>

1358
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:33,099
need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my network do I have</font>

1359
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:35,770
some port open<font color="#E5E5E5"> this shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be opened</font>

1360
00:48:33,099 --> 00:48:38,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so that's what you do this this</font>

1361
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">um you know palm perspective or pushing</font>

1362
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,140
the access list how to your you know on

1363
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:45,820
the router devices itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1364
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:49,359
another thing is how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people got</font>

1365
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:51,820
rancid run it answer it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes answered</font>

1366
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:53,049
powerful security tool because rancid is

1367
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:54,940
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those tools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's popped up</font>

1368
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:57,450
several times in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past where people</font>

1369
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:01,500
have found out their network was owned

1370
00:48:57,450 --> 00:49:03,640
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the rancid changes I</font>

1371
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,980
mean we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about whole networks</font>

1372
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:08,410
what he had like over 20 routers broken

1373
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:09,880
into and the only way they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out was</font>

1374
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,490
somebody looked at and say hi i got

1375
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,839
rancid errors but because the bad guys

1376
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,819
will on the router and configuring

1377
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:17,440
things into the router and rancid popped

1378
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,000
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> says oh there's a you know who</font>

1379
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,680
changed here and they go in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1380
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,130
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it they found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out oh</font>

1381
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:23,470
wow

1382
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:25,690
okay that this whole network is owned

1383
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:27,609
right so rancid is not only a tool for

1384
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:29,079
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage your configs but there's</font>

1385
00:49:27,609 --> 00:49:30,970
also an important security tool because

1386
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:32,650
it monitors and says anytime there's a

1387
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,180
change on your network you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should go out</font>

1388
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:38,740
there and have have a log of<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose</font>

1389
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:42,848
change of what we're all right so point

1390
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:44,709
protection edge protection this is drawn

1391
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:48,940
your tongue of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system and think of</font>

1392
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:52,000
it as a national boundary that's your

1393
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,799
autonomy you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> control over that and</font>

1394
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,150
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of like my personal rant</font>

1395
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:56,890
about you know you have control of the

1396
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:59,230
autonomous system you set up an

1397
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:00,700
organizational policy what packets go on

1398
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:02,920
what packets go out with service go oh

1399
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and which services go out and then you</font>

1400
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,809
have the power or network here today to

1401
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,339
enforce that what firewalls whatever you

1402
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:10,539
want to force it with and this is what

1403
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,250
we're talking about with edge protection

1404
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got to figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're</font>

1405
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,950
going to protect with and there's

1406
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:16,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">several different techniques you can do</font>

1407
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:18,578
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you know so you go out there and</font>

1408
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:21,460
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want the outside world to</font>

1409
00:50:18,579 --> 00:50:23,799
send telnet into me for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1410
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:26,170
in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that I should tab no tail</font>

1411
00:50:23,799 --> 00:50:28,029
net ever come in and reach any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my</font>

1412
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,079
routers and that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> your policy then</font>

1413
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:31,990
you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your ports on the</font>

1414
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:33,789
edge right this is an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1415
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:36,848
sort of things you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do on</font>

1416
00:50:33,789 --> 00:50:39,700
the edge so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you get this</font>

1417
00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:42,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of infrastructure access-list this</font>

1418
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:45,038
I a CL concept infrastructure access

1419
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:47,619
list you know is that access list you

1420
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:50,349
put on all devices facing out from you

1421
00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:53,500
network from the from hearing routers to

1422
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:55,960
customer routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right and that</font>

1423
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:58,509
access list is designed to say here's

1424
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,009
what goes into my my infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1425
00:50:58,509 --> 00:51:01,569
here's what passes through to all my

1426
00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:03,730
services whether it's a transit service

1427
00:51:01,569 --> 00:51:06,069
or you as a service provider doing some

1428
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:10,299
well some financial service or web

1429
00:51:06,069 --> 00:51:12,910
services whatever all right starting

1430
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:15,190
with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can start with deny</font>

1431
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:16,839
any of your space from external in other

1432
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,880
words you have infrastructure access

1433
00:51:16,839 --> 00:51:21,250
links why should you allow anybody in

1434
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,829
the world if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have inside a backbone</font>

the link between two periods inside your

world ever pingos<font color="#CCCCCC"> two connections you</font>

1439
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:34,330
know why should they go out there and

1440
00:51:33,069 --> 00:51:37,120
try to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in those two</font>

1441
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:39,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so you can say okay on that</font>

1442
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:42,700
particular you know link<font color="#CCCCCC"> between those</font>

1443
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:44,380
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> P routers don't allow any advil and</font>

1444
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:46,299
allow any traffic to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly to them</font>

1445
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:48,310
that doesn't stop people from doing

1446
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,980
transit across transit works just fine

1447
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:52,360
but those that link should be protected

1448
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,830
because that's critical to your service

1449
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:54,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's what we talked about where you</font>

1450
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,500
can go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of stuff</font>

1451
00:51:54,910 --> 00:51:57,580
you could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> default and</font>

1452
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:00,070
figure out what you should put in that

1453
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:03,670
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> access list things like</font>

1454
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:07,090
fragmented packets from<font color="#CCCCCC"> our packets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

interview<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers your router should</font>

1457
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,760
never receive a fragmented packet so

1458
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:14,799
fragmented packet reaches your router

1459
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,120
then sometimes broke you don't even need

1460
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,500
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that packet if it was the</font>

1461
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:19,029
fragmented packet you just need to know

1462
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:21,010
fragmented packets or hit my router

1463
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:22,330
sometimes broke you see fragmented

1464
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,950
packets in my network means one or two

1465
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:27,160
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes broke was somebody's</font>

1466
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:28,089
attacking me<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right because it's</font>

1467
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,529
hitting your router it's hidden you

1468
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:31,360
switch it in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> host infrastructure</font>

1469
00:52:29,530 --> 00:52:32,950
gear those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in there all</font>

1470
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:34,510
right it's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you know</font>

1471
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:36,160
fragmented packets and end at some

1472
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:38,530
application over a wireless link in

1473
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:40,149
Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's a different sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1474
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:43,180
scenario that's not what's comment into

1475
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:44,740
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so you look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

1476
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">things you can automatically figure out</font>

1477
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:48,520
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> should I put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure</font>

1478
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:49,930
assets list it kind of comes up really

1479
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:54,400
clear if you start you know thinking

1480
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:56,259
through so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know permit transit</font>

1481
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,910
traffic through it all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1482
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">your services so you identify those with</font>

1483
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:05,470
it right you know the fragment to the

1484
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:08,710
core you know example you know anything

1485
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:10,750
with source 127 001<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you</font>

1486
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:12,910
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at you know groups like that right</font>

1487
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,860
so you kind of group them all together

1488
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:18,670
you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorts of things you put</font>

1489
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:20,410
pass in there with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right if</font>

1490
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:22,210
anybody has a deployed infrastructure

1491
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:24,100
excellence list then here's a quick

1492
00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:25,180
methodology you can use with it it's

1493
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,410
kind of we've used this in many

1494
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,299
different deployments<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how to employ</font>

1495
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:30,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure access list which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

1496
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,720
not do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all at once I've seen many</font>

1497
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:32,740
providers go out there and they spend

1498
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,480
months and months and<font color="#E5E5E5"> months trying to</font>

1499
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,399
build this very<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated list and</font>

1500
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,040
what happens is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get it</font>

1501
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,450
deployed because it's so complicated

1502
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes the best way to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1503
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:45,009
in phases<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take the things you know</font>

1504
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:46,390
you can do is start with those right and

1505
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:47,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start adding to it so your phase 1</font>

1506
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,808
phase 2 phase 3

1507
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:52,058
is for you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> learning with it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1508
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:54,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so you can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through like number</font>

1509
00:53:52,059 --> 00:53:57,849
one put up a list and say here's my idea

1510
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,529
but don't drop anything just permit them

1511
00:53:57,849 --> 00:54:01,029
all and count them so then you can

1512
00:53:59,529 --> 00:54:02,619
validate so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay here's all the</font>

1513
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:04,779
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I permit through here's the</font>

1514
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff I want to drop an accountant so</font>

1515
00:54:04,779 --> 00:54:08,559
then you can all you know get the swing

1516
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:10,629
what we call a classification stage how

1517
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,210
much badness is already out there you

1518
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,950
know you say no ssh going into you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1519
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:16,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">SSH of talk about going into my routers</font>

1520
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:18,430
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropping at first I just</font>

1521
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:20,440
permit it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Count it and say oh wow</font>

1522
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:22,839
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot going on here all right</font>

1523
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,670
then you can say okay here's any of this

1524
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:26,288
critical you know i miss anybody there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1525
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,450
miss any service and am I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1526
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:30,519
impact anybody is any heads going to pop

1527
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:32,169
up because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just drop this and this</font>

1528
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:34,328
classification stage helps you figure

1529
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:36,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">out what heads are going to pop up when</font>

1530
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:38,260
you do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right then you begin to</font>

1531
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:40,240
filter and do a suit you know don't try

1532
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:41,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do everything in detail you do here's</font>

1533
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,910
the things i know i can leave the drop

1534
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:45,368
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't get source</font>

1535
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:47,710
address 127 001 for example coming in

1536
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:48,880
you can say okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want how</font>

1537
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:51,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that says they can tell me so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drop</font>

1538
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1539
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,579
get it deployed make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure your network</font>

1540
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,649
stable you take a deep breath say okay

1541
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:58,839
this is good right then you look your

1542
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,549
lungs is he okay what's the next level

1543
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:03,700
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do if you phase two</font>

1544
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:06,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so this is this is a kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

1545
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:08,558
phased approach that can keep your you

1546
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:10,180
know your network more stable that way

1547
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,680
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying to say okay I want</font>

1548
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,788
to try to filter everything you have

1549
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,379
months of meetings trying to figure

1550
00:55:12,789 --> 00:55:16,059
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> the filter all right</font>

1551
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,549
sometimes it's better just to start

1552
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:20,349
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and roll on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and phase then</font>

1553
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:22,480
to try to make it all perfect because

1554
00:55:20,349 --> 00:55:24,009
it's never<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be perfect right so</font>

1555
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,750
then you roll up your your basic

1556
00:55:24,009 --> 00:55:27,099
protection and then you just increase

1557
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:30,509
deployment and you keep on with your

1558
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:32,410
cycle with it right so so you know it's

1559
00:55:30,509 --> 00:55:33,940
another thing to think about is

1560
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:36,609
universal access list I'm never going to

1561
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a perfect tool so this is a tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1562
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:40,180
your tool kit but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> never going to</font>

1563
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,589
be perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when people say hey I got</font>

1564
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,078
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> assets list I'm all</font>

1565
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:45,400
protected right and then some vendor

1566
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,859
comes out and says oh here's a

1567
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,819
vulnerability of this crafted packet it

1568
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:51,160
goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> right through the infrastructure</font>

1569
00:55:48,819 --> 00:55:52,930
assets list right they're never going to

1570
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,180
be perfect tools out there so this is

1571
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">adds resilience to network to two</font>

1572
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:59,500
problems but don't think of this and

1573
00:55:57,220 --> 00:56:00,649
don't communicate to your bosses hey we

1574
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:02,150
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> an infrastructure has to play</font>

1575
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,920
so we're all protected it's like when

1576
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,990
people say hey I put a file<font color="#E5E5E5"> on front of</font>

1577
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,789
my network I'm protected I'm secure I

1578
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:09,799
got a firewall all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> no it doesn't</font>

1579
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:12,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">work that way right it's the same thing</font>

1580
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:14,569
with these it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a layer of your</font>

1581
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:18,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">defense with it well it took a black</font>

1582
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:20,480
hole bgp you know it surprises<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1583
00:56:18,589 --> 00:56:23,470
and say bgp is one of our most powerful

1584
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,150
security tools and it ended up that way

1585
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:28,430
right how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here martial arts</font>

1586
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:30,230
people everybody martial arts guys you

1587
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:32,779
know there r hardstyle soft styles

1588
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:34,730
hardstyle is you know brute force hit

1589
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:36,920
each other the soft styles or you cannot

1590
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:38,839
redirect it upon its energy<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

1591
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aikido you kind of need a director upon</font>

1592
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:42,230
its energy somebody comes at you instead

1593
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:43,788
of just became head on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

1594
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:46,490
redirect them that's what we're doing

1595
00:56:43,789 --> 00:56:48,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">with bgp we redirect into energy attack</font>

1596
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:49,819
comes at us instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting brute</font>

1597
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,950
force and trying to throw a firewall

1598
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:53,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">acl's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right in front of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that attack what</font>

1599
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:56,720
we're doing is we redirect that energy

1600
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:58,579
to null 0 to a sinkhole to you know

1601
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,640
shunted service to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> clean up service</font>

1602
00:56:58,579 --> 00:57:03,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so the basic motor go black hole</font>

1603
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,049
is the first of many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different uses of</font>

1604
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:07,970
using bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> to instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of being brute</font>

1605
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:09,349
force against the badness you kind of

1606
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:12,439
redirect it to the direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1607
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:15,680
go because us as people who control the

1608
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:17,809
routing protocols we control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flow we</font>

1609
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:20,960
control traffic flow we're traffic

1610
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:22,940
engineers that's what we do so what

1611
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,619
we're doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're engineering the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DOS</font>

1612
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,470
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the badness to the direction</font>

1613
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:29,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to go and this is the mental</font>

1614
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:32,240
hoop that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security people have</font>

1615
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:34,609
to change and get a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> mindset</font>

1616
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,410
paradise shift to understand these<font color="#E5E5E5"> peas</font>

1617
00:57:34,609 --> 00:57:40,759
this and many other techniques were used

1618
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:43,609
in BGP with right so here's a network

1619
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,220
layout and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have bgp across my network</font>

1620
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:47,808
and basically in my Knock network

1621
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,578
operations center here i have what i

1622
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:51,710
call a trigger router this could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1623
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:53,569
router it could be a it could be a box

1624
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:55,839
in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> garber does this RV has a trigger</font>

1625
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:58,730
element to it right for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right um</font>

1626
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:00,589
so you take and you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want a</font>

1627
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:03,799
black hole I got an attack going on

1628
00:58:00,589 --> 00:58:06,109
somewhere so over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I send in the BGP</font>

1629
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:07,609
advertisement the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP advertisement then</font>

1630
00:58:06,109 --> 00:58:10,308
gets flooded to every router and saw my

1631
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:12,500
network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then on those routers I have</font>

1632
00:58:10,309 --> 00:58:14,930
a configuration setup that configuration

1633
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:16,880
could be I'll you know this basic

1634
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:19,098
two approaches we use we use a static

1635
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,869
route pointer or we use a community

1636
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:22,910
poignant community pointer gives us more

1637
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:25,010
granularity so that's what most people

1638
00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:27,049
use is using the community so this

1639
00:58:25,010 --> 00:58:29,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">advertising over here has a particular</font>

1640
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:31,819
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> and based off that community</font>

1641
00:58:29,059 --> 00:58:33,319
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in this case what we're</font>

1642
00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:36,140
going to do is a willing to send it to

1643
00:58:33,319 --> 00:58:38,808
null 0 so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can have a DOS attack</font>

1644
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:40,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming in through all my network and I</font>

1645
00:58:38,809 --> 00:58:43,160
can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stop it on my edge</font>

1646
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:45,170
because when it all adds up and hits my

1647
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,420
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> down here my target you know</font>

1648
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:49,190
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> big bandwidth all hit in one PE</font>

1649
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:52,550
router and what I need to do is I need

1650
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:54,160
to lessen the damage I need a lesson to

1651
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:57,500
damage I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push to attack out here</font>

1652
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:59,540
now from a service perspective you want

1653
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,609
to a customer getting hit you know they

1654
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:03,079
get a Doss attack you know you can

1655
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:05,900
immediately they call you<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset I need</font>

1656
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:07,670
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a dose right say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok no problem</font>

1657
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,559
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your address this is ok let me</font>

1658
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:11,780
give you some relief go take your black

1659
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:13,819
hole you now push the attack off the

1660
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:15,470
targeted IP address and you push it up

1661
00:59:13,819 --> 00:59:17,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these guys over here so you're</font>

1662
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,859
dropping over here these routers over

1663
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,180
here are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more likely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taken you go to</font>

1664
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:22,759
customer says I've just given you

1665
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:26,480
partial service recovery the address

1666
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:28,520
under attack is still dost it's just

1667
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,520
instead of hidden down here the address

1668
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,040
is black hold over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but all your</font>

1669
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,450
other addresses you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can still now send</font>

1670
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,390
traffic before he couldn't send any

1671
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:41,058
traffic the link was choked up if it's

1672
00:59:38,390 --> 00:59:42,940
given impartial service recovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1673
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:45,140
he doesn't have full service recovery

1674
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:46,880
right for full service recovery you need

1675
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,440
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some you know clean up tools and</font>

1676
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,270
sifting tools you know other products in

1677
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,829
there to do full<font color="#E5E5E5"> service recovery but</font>

1678
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:55,309
this is this gives you partial service

1679
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:57,559
recovery all right now this technique is

1680
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:59,119
used over and over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again how</font>

1681
00:59:57,559 --> 01:00:02,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">many people here have this configure in</font>

1682
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:04,819
their network right so this technique is

1683
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:06,200
out there it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right you can</font>

1684
01:00:04,819 --> 01:00:07,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">look around tomorrow and you can talk to</font>

1685
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,450
different people have got a deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1686
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:10,250
network there's many different

1687
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:11,868
deployment you know I've gone through

1688
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:13,760
I'm talking about oh about 50 different

1689
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:16,040
networks I've worked with you know get

1690
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,410
this deployed no network and the

1691
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:20,329
deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this you can do it in a</font>

1692
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:24,410
way the point network it doesn't curl

1693
01:00:20,329 --> 01:00:25,520
any downtime right you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> deploy in the</font>

1694
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,779
middle of a dos attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> I highly</font>

1695
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,780
recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't deploy in the middle</font>

1696
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,580
of a toss attack but it's

1697
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,960
two big natural carriers in a beloved

1698
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:32,730
austech where the bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> was getting hit</font>

1699
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:34,680
and said the way for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to stop this is</font>

1700
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:36,060
deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technique right because</font>

1701
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:37,680
they couldn't throw a CL is to stop it

1702
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:39,420
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the technique of deployed so</font>

1703
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,910
this kind of works out we got white

1704
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:43,830
papers on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this right so vendor-specific</font>

1705
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:45,299
white papers you know the cisco got a

1706
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:47,340
white paper rivers got white paper on

1707
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:48,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jennifer's got slides on it you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1708
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:50,160
through the configuration with it

1709
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,200
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of peer advice you could</font>

1710
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,879
get questions on it this is a question

1711
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you thought nanog say hey can people</font>

1712
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,090
send me pointers on how to configure

1713
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:58,800
remote of a black hole on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my network if</font>

1714
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:00,990
I we get a lot of private answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1715
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:03,810
of experience about how to do this all

1716
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:05,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we do this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry</font>

1717
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:06,930
is when you do it on your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1718
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:08,549
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue on right this is where I've</font>

1719
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:13,350
shown this slide before where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1720
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">work at all the all the way back it's a</font>

1721
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:18,450
hammer it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a perfect tool but it's</font>

1722
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:20,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">very common you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a carpenter uses a</font>

1723
01:01:18,450 --> 01:01:22,919
hammer all the time right so it's a

1724
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:24,300
common tool you use right but it's it's

1725
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:27,060
not a tool that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

1726
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:29,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">every situation as a carpenter all right</font>

1727
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:31,500
and those consequences with it too

1728
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:33,150
unfortunately because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

1729
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,500
providers found this tool and we found

1730
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a very effective tool to stop</font>

1731
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:39,660
the bad guys control channel so we see a

1732
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:42,240
botnet you see the controller black hole

1733
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:45,299
it on the net so everybody black holes

1734
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:47,879
it all right then the bad guys say oh ok

1735
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll move off of a ir c control channel</font>

1736
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:51,390
I'll move the peer-to-peer so

1737
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,770
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the reasons why we</font>

1738
01:01:51,390 --> 01:01:54,779
have peer-to-peer botnets today is

1739
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:57,600
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good at black hole</font>

1740
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:59,430
on their controllers<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so so</font>

1741
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:01,350
there's there's consequences with this

1742
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:03,299
right but it's a tool that you know I

1743
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:04,770
recommend every provider if you have

1744
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:06,420
multiple routers you have DGP in your

1745
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:10,230
network have this thing pre configured

1746
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:12,240
and ready to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so it's out</font>

1747
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:14,070
there all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there's here's some</font>

1748
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:16,799
white papers out there there's another

1749
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:19,200
tutorial with this there is you know

1750
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,450
Chris kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this one who</font>

1751
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:23,430
is that Verizon back in 2002 so this has

1752
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:25,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">been out for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a while 2002 you can pull</font>

1753
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:31,049
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> his presentation we're he and Chris</font>

1754
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:34,250
Chris O'Brien gremlin right he's still

1755
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:34,250
working at<font color="#E5E5E5"> school system or</font>

1756
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,860
hosting company now right<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so</font>

1757
01:02:36,450 --> 01:02:39,419
they came in and they actually walked

1758
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:42,300
through in detail here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the configs we</font>

1759
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,980
used right here is how we did this

1760
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,320
here's a demonstration about routers how

1761
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:47,790
we did this here's how we do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1762
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,660
network at that look at the time right

1763
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:54,330
so straight up with it and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there</font>

1764
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:56,250
there is there is an RFC on this all

1765
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,890
right and there's a new internet draft

1766
01:02:56,250 --> 01:03:01,800
that Warren kumari's doing a source

1767
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:03,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">space drop right so just add it to this</font>

1768
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,770
and then we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at there's</font>

1769
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:09,540
other papers on how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> sinkholes and</font>

1770
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff so let's let's talk sinkholes so</font>

1771
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:13,620
sinkholes is kind of like Swiss Army

1772
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,500
knife now some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say oh aren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1773
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:18,870
talking about honey notes no different

1774
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,600
so a sinkhole is something that you

1775
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:22,740
engineer into a network it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

1776
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,710
that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to throw a lot of</font>

1777
01:03:22,740 --> 01:03:27,660
packets down a pipe to analyze with it

1778
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:29,070
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Swiss Army knife because the</font>

1779
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:31,080
uses of people are finding out with

1780
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:32,640
sinkholes is multitude now one of the

1781
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:35,430
uses you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use in a sinkhole is</font>

1782
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,830
opponent hunting it in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1783
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:39,290
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> honey net and sinkholes are two</font>

1784
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:41,400
different things the sinkhole is

1785
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:44,400
something you engineer into your network

1786
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:47,220
and you can put a hunting it into but

1787
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">hunting is not a sinkhole okay it's the</font>

1788
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:51,620
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about you wouldn't take</font>

1789
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:55,859
and throw a Doss attack into a honey net

1790
01:03:51,620 --> 01:03:57,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">die right so we're in a sinkhole you</font>

1791
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,220
would throw a DOS attack into a into a

1792
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:02,009
sinkhole because it's designed to take

1793
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:03,270
that level of attack traffic right you

1794
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:06,690
can use them amount of all sorts of

1795
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:08,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">things you can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the black holes</font>

1796
01:04:06,690 --> 01:04:09,780
Tar Pits<font color="#CCCCCC"> shantz honeynet honey pots all</font>

1797
01:04:08,850 --> 01:04:14,279
these different things you can put

1798
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:15,960
inside of a sinkhole right so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1799
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:18,900
is the name that it's it's you know it's

1800
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:20,670
not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Donny net and</font>

1801
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sinkhole with it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason why</font>

1802
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:25,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get into slides here so here's</font>

1803
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,480
here's a attack scenario right so I got

1804
01:04:25,050 --> 01:04:29,940
crossed my network I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack</font>

1805
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">going into a customer right customers</font>

1806
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,700
called me up and said hey I need help

1807
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:35,430
with this das attack what I do with it

1808
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">now I can use the same remote trigger</font>

1809
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:40,080
black hole but instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the</font>

1810
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:42,780
black hole and pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to null 0 I</font>

1811
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:45,390
point the black hole to my sink hole and

1812
01:04:42,780 --> 01:04:47,440
my sink hole over here is designed to

1813
01:04:45,390 --> 01:04:50,170
take you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> over here this</font>

1814
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:53,500
could be a 40 gig attack and I designed

1815
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:55,359
that to be a 40 gig sinkhole now 40 gigs

1816
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,410
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> blocked traffic right so this is</font>

1817
01:04:55,359 --> 01:05:00,400
where you get techniques like any

1818
01:04:56,410 --> 01:05:02,259
casting calls right but say this over

1819
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,400
here is designed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the attack and</font>

1820
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:04,510
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make sure it's designed to</font>

1821
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:06,130
take the t'akon companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1822
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:07,390
designed to take the attack at that

1823
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:09,460
speed what's going to happen is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

1824
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:11,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take down that sinkhole right so what</font>

1825
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:13,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do over here is they go and advertise</font>

1826
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:15,940
this address this address under attack

1827
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:19,180
advertise it into the sinkhole so now

1828
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:20,740
I'm able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to monitor the attack now the</font>

1829

customer just got partial service

address that's dost<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and that</font>

1834
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:38,828
when IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is dost I'm advertising</font>

1835
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,419
that / 32 over here now inside the

1836
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:42,880
sinkhole<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can start seeing what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1837
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:44,200
on with this guy I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it out</font>

1838
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">hunting that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can point it on a</font>

1839
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,770
honeypot I can do all sorts of little

1840
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:49,990
things with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also monitor when</font>

1841
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:52,150
they attack disappears I could also

1842
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:54,848
monitor if the tech disappears did the

1843
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:56,710
attack rotate because what these bad

1844
01:05:54,849 --> 01:05:58,869
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do is they'll do rotate the</font>

1845
01:05:56,710 --> 01:06:01,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">rotate their attacks now rotating</font>

1846
01:05:58,869 --> 01:06:03,880
attacks means they shift the attack so

1847
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:06,849
the basic rotation would be shipped IP

1848
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:08,790
address so he shifts IP address and he

1849
01:06:06,849 --> 01:06:11,200
attacks a different IP address down here

1850
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:13,829
because these bad guys who do dos

1851
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:18,368
attacks they're not ghosts attacks

1852
01:06:13,829 --> 01:06:20,020
they're extortion they're black ball and

1853
01:06:18,369 --> 01:06:21,640
there you know political let me take

1854
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:23,650
down the site there's a there's a human

1855
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:25,810
motivation behind these things it just

1856
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:27,160
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> Doss for fun there's some sort of</font>

1857
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,049
motivation there's either criminal

1858
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,640
motivation because of doing it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

1859
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:32,319
or there's a political motivation

1860
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,299
because they have some political game

1861
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:37,089
behind it which means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

1862
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,890
monitoring these attacks which is why a

1863
01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:40,540
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times shoved sudden these into a</font>

1864
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:42,069
sinkhole allows you to monitor what's

1865
01:06:40,540 --> 01:06:43,660
going on see what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it so</font>

1866
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:46,720
we can collect more data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1867
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:48,790
what happens when they rotate all right

1868
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:50,109
and they can rotate with IP addresses

1869
01:06:48,790 --> 01:06:51,609
they can rotate with their different

1870
01:06:50,109 --> 01:06:53,619
state ataxic it's a different state

1871
01:06:51,609 --> 01:06:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacks at you it can start with ICMP</font>

1872
01:06:53,619 --> 01:06:58,270
and the ship to IP and ship the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP trip</font>

1873
01:06:55,839 --> 01:07:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">to TCP you know small window size</font>

1874

different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1876
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:06,279
right so here what I've done is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1877
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,589
pulled the attack away from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my my</font>

1878
01:07:06,279 --> 01:07:12,069
customer I've given impartial service

1879
01:07:08,589 --> 01:07:14,890
recovery also this router down here I've

1880
01:07:12,069 --> 01:07:17,140
eliminated collateral damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1881
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,848
because I pulled the attack off and I

1882
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:20,529
start working in a sinkhole now what I

1883
01:07:18,849 --> 01:07:23,259
put in Sunday's sinkhole put all sorts

1884
01:07:20,529 --> 01:07:24,970
of monitors right we use a sleeve

1885
01:07:23,259 --> 01:07:27,160
sequels this is you know and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font>

1886
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:29,558
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor things like sequel worms</font>

1887
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,879
and things like that we know badness out

1888
01:07:29,559 --> 01:07:32,650
in the net we know what computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1889
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,869
infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> because what happens is people</font>

1890
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:37,720
configure the sinkholes and it put some

1891
01:07:34,869 --> 01:07:39,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">dark IP address space a what's dark IP</font>

1892
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,589
address space dark IP address space is

1893

your dark IP address space and stuff is

configured on the router and let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it not</font>

1900
01:07:52,059 --> 01:07:55,749
do anything because when you put in an

1906
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:07,299
haven't allocated and I stick it into a

1907
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:09,399
sinkhole instead and put some simple

1908

monitors on it everybody who<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan and</font>

sinkholes 80s sinkholes is where I take

1920
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,908
my sinkhole address and I put it on many

1921
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:43,448
different sinkholes look at it in

1922
01:08:39,908 --> 01:08:46,269
different parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1923
01:08:43,448 --> 01:08:47,979
instead of I've a big national network

1924
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:49,900
my network spread all over the United

1925
01:08:47,979 --> 01:08:52,000
States instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just putting my sink</font>

alone here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Detroit or wherever your</font>

1927
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,170
headquarters<font color="#CCCCCC"> that instead I take here's</font>

1928
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:58,120
a mega pop here's a mega pop here's in

1929
01:08:56,170 --> 01:09:00,580
mega pop here's a mega pop all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I</font>

1930
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:02,679
take you know six different mega pops<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1931
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,929
configure a sinkhole eats all six mega

1932
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:09,339
pops and I put one address on each and

1933
01:09:04,929 --> 01:09:11,408
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast it into my network okay so by</font>

1934
01:09:09,339 --> 01:09:13,069
any cast it into my network now when I

1935
01:09:11,408 --> 01:09:15,049
go through and I take

1936
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:17,059
attack traffic to a customer and I

1937
01:09:15,050 --> 01:09:20,360
shunted over to the sink hole it goes to

1938
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:22,520
the closest sinkhole<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

1939
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:24,740
way you can distribute the load LTE

1940
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:25,910
network it's a way of just distributing

1941
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:27,559
out you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have as big of a</font>

1945
01:09:31,430 --> 01:09:35,960
one right this is deployed this is

1946
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:38,059
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some people taught</font>

1947
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:39,800
me because they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with one</font>

1948
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:41,300
sinkhole and it went out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well I on</font>

1949
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:44,810
just any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast and a deployer all over</font>

1950
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:46,160
the place<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I don't know if I</font>

1951
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:47,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">can tell which which provider is out</font>

1952
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:51,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">there but they do to any casting calls</font>

1953
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:53,090
with it right so they work and I take

1954
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:54,800
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> conficker comforter we</font>

1955
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:56,960
had like you know five different

1956
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:58,700
sinkholes already set up and what confer

1957
01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:02,000
could came up we said we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

1958
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:03,889
and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and take all the DNS that</font>

1959
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,520
configures using for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> control channel</font>

1960
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:09,770
and shunt it into sinkholes and then

1961
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:12,710
monitor the sinkhole hits well we took

1962
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:15,500
existing sinkholes and we took the IP

wouldn't be able to respond to configure

1969
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:27,769
as fast as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could so that's why</font>

1970
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:30,440
setting these up you can set them up and

1971
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:31,760
do the minimal with them and then having

1975
01:10:36,530 --> 01:10:40,849
do you set up a base of sinkhole this is

1976
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:42,620
I actually walked somebody through this

1977
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:43,790
and that person is is here this

1978
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:45,170
confident see him in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1979
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:48,769
actually walk them through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

1980
01:10:45,170 --> 01:10:51,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">just go get a box load up TCP dump and</font>

1981
01:10:48,770 --> 01:10:52,760
look at an mrt<font color="#CCCCCC"> g graph and put it into</font>

1982
01:10:51,170 --> 01:10:55,100
your network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> start with one</font>

loaded up he started you know advertised

they got all this garbage come down in

1989
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:11,000
there like wow why is this going on in

<font color="#E5E5E5">my network why do I have bogan I might</font>

have people talking to Bogut address is

1992
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:17,780

1993
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:20,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so it can start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as simple as</font>

1994
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:23,840
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you can you know a basic</font>

1995
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:26,239
infrastructure you get a router<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

1996
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,550
put you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a switch inside and</font>

1997
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:30,259
you get computers inside here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do</font>

1998
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:32,539
analyzers and you can just grow it out

1999
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:34,460
from there right you could look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you</font>

2000
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:36,619
know people put<font color="#CCCCCC"> harbor boxes in there</font>

2003
01:11:39,139 --> 01:11:43,010
right so in quarantines with it you can

2004
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:44,960
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> backscatter traffic on there so this</font>

2005
01:11:43,010 --> 01:11:46,550
is grows up with it if you don't know

2006
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,980
about backscatter backscatter is a good

monitor and donate their domain names

2014
01:12:03,469 --> 01:12:10,550
with backscatter right we should bring

<font color="#E5E5E5">that up and refresh people what we found</font>

2020
01:12:17,570 --> 01:12:21,230
somebody went after juniper networks so

2029
01:12:38,059 --> 01:12:43,159
backscatter wise so as they're hitting

2030
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:47,058
the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dns server that they're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Juniper authority so all we needed to do</font>

2033
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:56,360
on our part for our juniperus thority is

2034
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:59,239
monitor backscatter and then we can see

2035
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:01,159
who in the world which dns caches in the

2036
01:12:59,239 --> 01:13:04,280
world is getting hit with the commence

2037
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:07,518
the attack against our domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

2038
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:09,469
so backscatter even though you go back

2039
01:13:07,519 --> 01:13:11,719
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this 2001 paper that KO first</font>

2040
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:13,880
mentioned backscatter is<font color="#E5E5E5"> example one of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">those tools so backscatter was really</font>

2042
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:18,349
interested in 2001-2002 we saw a lot of

2043
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,820
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have other tools that kind</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> less interested people still kind of</font>

2045
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:24,440
looked at it but was it big then come

2046
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:26,599
last summer<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right then a colleague</font>

2047
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:28,579
up in Canada realizes hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kaminski's</font>

2048
01:13:26,599 --> 01:13:30,650
noisy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's looking like backscatter</font>

2049
01:13:28,579 --> 01:13:32,210
all over the place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I now we have a</font>

2050

weighted of detecting when somebody

01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:39,559
actually tries to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kaminski all right</font>

2052
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,100
backscatter so toolkit service for our

2053
01:13:39,559 --> 01:13:42,020
tool

2054
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:44,000
you look at the toolkit back together if

2055
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:46,600
you don't know what backscatter is check

2056
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,610
out this paper all right read about it

2057
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:52,400
it's very important tool you know to go

2058
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:54,519
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there sinkholes is the one of the</font>

best<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways of monitoring the backscatter</font>

2060
01:13:54,520 --> 01:14:00,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so you know you can monitor spoof</font>

2061
01:13:58,310 --> 01:14:01,910
ranges with it all right you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put</font>

2062
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:03,320
little a little classification less

2063
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:05,570
taxes with there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

2064
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:07,639
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it so one of the</font>

01:14:05,570 --> 01:14:09,410
deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> dies we're going to be I'm going to</font>

2066
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:11,360
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on getting over the next year</font>

2067
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:14,300
is getting some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys who go to I</font>

2068
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:16,969
seen run really really robust sinkhole

2069
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,710
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and really</font>

2070
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:21,650
convinced on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state come on come over</font>

2071
01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:23,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and give us the details give us</font>

2072
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:25,759
good deep dive tutorials on this stuff

2073
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:27,380
you know people off<font color="#E5E5E5"> scene slides like</font>

2074
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,990
these before but what we need to get is

2075
01:14:27,380 --> 01:14:31,430
really operational experience of some of

2076
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:33,620
the guys who do this stuff and have all

2077
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:35,240
their scripts and look at the script

2078
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:37,220
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing with it so people others</font>

2079
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:40,010
can say hey I can do the same thing I

2080
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:43,940
can get this going all right some safety

2081
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:45,920
precautions of sinkholes no export all

2082
01:14:43,940 --> 01:14:47,900
right and the reason I say no export is

2083
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,050
just think of what happened in Pakistan

2084
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:54,980
with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> too you don't want to run into</font>

2085
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:56,780
the one of those mistakes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

2086
01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:58,429
other other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pulling the</font>

2087
01:14:56,780 --> 01:15:00,259
garbage out I cannot mention this you

2088
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:02,450
get your router when you configure your

2089
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:04,730
aggregate on your router's right to pull

2090
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:06,830
in and garbage anyways because you're

2091
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:09,469
advertising your aggregates out you know

but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can also do is send it over</font>

2101
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,910
to you know your<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sink hole over so</font>

2102
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:34,010
it's another sinkhole where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> this slide</font>

2103
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:36,430
I guess I didn't have a slide there but

2104
01:15:34,010 --> 01:15:38,810
send it into the sinkhole with it right

2105
01:15:36,430 --> 01:15:44,990
here's an example of any cat sinkholes

2106
01:15:38,810 --> 01:15:48,590
kind of covered all this so sorts

2107
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:50,030
address validation check our time real

2108
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:55,800
quick

2109
01:15:50,030 --> 01:15:58,230
bc p38 basics of this if you haven't

2110
01:15:55,800 --> 01:16:00,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard this before as any packet from</font>

2111
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:02,489
your customer whose source address

2112
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:07,980
doesn't match what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed to</font>

2113
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:10,678
route drop it okay and so if you're my

2114
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:12,000
customer and I've allocated a block of

2115
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:14,100
addresses to you and you're sending<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

2116
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,130
address is that as out not<font color="#CCCCCC"> belong into</font>

2117
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">my block I shouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be mountain as</font>

2118
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:20,790
those packets through unless I have some

2119
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:22,469
sort of contract even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I have some</font>

2120
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:25,019
sort of contract it says I do that then

2121
01:16:22,469 --> 01:16:27,030
I'll know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what those addresses are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

2122
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's basically what it what the</font>

2123
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:33,330
what the technique is there's an RC on

2124
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:34,769
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCP 38 IRC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 28 27 there's some talk</font>

2125
01:16:33,330 --> 01:16:36,300
about updating this because there's

2126
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,409
other techniques we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

2127
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:41,670
maybe some<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things we should be</font>

2128
01:16:37,409 --> 01:16:44,159
doing like you know do we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dscp</font>

2129
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:45,870
code points for example so we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen</font>

2130
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:48,150
to any dscp code point or should we

2131
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:49,679
figure out what do you see p code points

2132
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:52,199
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i allow which ones i don't allow</font>

2133
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:54,510
right so there's talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and we</font>

2134
01:16:52,199 --> 01:16:58,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">found that out because as people certain</font>

2135
01:16:54,510 --> 01:17:00,510
providers have rolled out voice services

2136
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:03,360
right they found there was a direct

2137
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:05,190
correlation to them enforcing what we

2138
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:08,400
call what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I call Biffy serve phase zero</font>

2139
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:10,199
a fee for if he surveys zero is like we

2140
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,230
set all the packets come into my network

2141
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:14,610
to DSC<font color="#E5E5E5"> pico point of zero and they found</font>

2142
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:17,489
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a bunch of security things</font>

2143
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:19,710
disappeared off the network now they

2144
01:17:17,489 --> 01:17:21,780
were doing this to prepare<font color="#CCCCCC"> for voice TOS</font>

2145
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:25,560
invoice right and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> found a</font>

2146
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:27,809
collateral benefit of security right so

2147
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:29,100
this is what is that right now it's on

2148
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,620
the source address of people looking at

2149
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:33,480
other things with it where do you filter

2150
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:35,280
your filter on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it this</font>

2151
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:37,199
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service provider edge right</font>

2152
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:39,059
service for our edge where I'm doing

2153
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:41,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Apeiron has always been a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

2154
01:17:39,060 --> 01:17:43,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">more complicated about trying to do that</font>

2155
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:44,730
dynamically and operationally you know

2156
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:46,679
effectively because trying to maintain

2157
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:48,809
acl's on the service wire edge is much

2158
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:51,270
harder than maintaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> acl's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down here</font>

2159
01:17:48,810 --> 01:17:53,510
on the customer bench so it's very much

2160
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:55,620
been a customer edge sort of technique

2161
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:57,060
principles around this is filt as close

2162
01:17:55,620 --> 01:18:00,360
to your customer as possible as

2163
01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:02,020
precisely as possible and and try to do

2164
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:04,030
source and destination as much as

2165
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:05,560
possible you can combine this if you do

2166
01:18:04,030 --> 01:18:07,690
an ACL you can combine this with the

2167
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,550
infrastructure access-list many people

2168
01:18:07,690 --> 01:18:11,559
do there are multitude of techniques

2169
01:18:09,550 --> 01:18:12,910
down there is a static access list which

2170
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,700
a lot of people talk about there's

2171
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:16,900
dynamic access list of you got triple-a

2172
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:20,260
triple-a has capabilities where you can

2173
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:22,210
load dynamically<font color="#E5E5E5"> access list whenever</font>

2174
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:25,150
that connection comes up there's unicast

2175
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:28,330
RPF which is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've use the route</font>

2176
01:18:25,150 --> 01:18:30,280
table as my authority of what I do so in

2177
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:32,200
other words<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll do to look up if I have</font>

2178
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,389
a path afford and path to the router

2179
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:36,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">then I can use that forging path and</font>

2180
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:38,410
look up the source address to see if

2181
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:40,810
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> matches off the interface okay</font>

2182
01:18:38,410 --> 01:18:45,550
there's cable source verify this is

2183
01:18:40,810 --> 01:18:48,610
actually in pcc PCM the doctors to it

2184
01:18:45,550 --> 01:18:51,310
got put in right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ducks is three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

2185
01:18:48,610 --> 01:18:54,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is in the docsis spec with packet</font>

2186
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:56,290
cable I'll multimedia right and then I p

2187
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:58,990
source verify which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

2188
01:18:56,290 --> 01:19:00,100
equivalent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll find this in a new</font>

2189
01:18:58,990 --> 01:19:03,340
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group where they're trying to</font>

2190
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:06,220
expand this in savvy or somehow one of

2191
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:10,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one of the working groups</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sadi right</font>

2192
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:13,120
so with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're so so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

2193
01:19:10,570 --> 01:19:16,540
the new technology is about making this

2194
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:18,340
operationally cheaper to do is what

2195
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:20,920
they're doing with it but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many</font>

2196
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:24,760
providers who do do this and if you

2197
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:27,160
don't do this then you know we a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

2198
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">people encourage you to do this now give</font>

2199
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:33,400
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> where this is a threat there</font>

2200
01:19:30,580 --> 01:19:36,250
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of open dns cache resolvers out</font>

2201
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:38,650
there and is open dns cache resolvers a

2202
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:41,410
very vulnerable as we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out last</font>

2203
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:44,259
year two classes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss attacks that</font>

2204
01:19:41,410 --> 01:19:46,690
can have a amplification effect in other

2205
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:49,360
words a small packet going in will

2206
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:52,509
generate more bigger packets coming out

2207
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:56,530
of the open dns resolver and the thing

2208
01:19:52,510 --> 01:20:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that facilitates this is the ability of</font>

2209
01:19:56,530 --> 01:20:03,460
people to spoof addresses all right and

2210
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:06,040
so we we saw last year basically bad

2211
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:07,870
guys going after each other yeah that's

2212
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:09,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we were fortunate but we receive</font>

2213
01:20:07,870 --> 01:20:11,470
collateral damage through a series of

2214
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:13,900
attacks last year from these bad guys

2215
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:14,949
going after each other so is basically

2216
01:20:13,900 --> 01:20:17,768
two games

2217
01:20:14,949 --> 01:20:21,280
you know black in each other right so

2218
01:20:17,769 --> 01:20:24,369
but what it exposes is so that hey if we

2219
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:26,559
had bc p38 deployed more ubiquitously

2220
01:20:24,369 --> 01:20:29,170
across the internet then this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

2221
01:20:26,559 --> 01:20:32,229
attack would be harder to implement

2222
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:33,429
right would make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lemonade we still</font>

2223
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:35,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to close up the US open resolvers</font>

2224
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:37,840
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make it harder for the</font>

2225
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:40,420
bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out there and use abuse</font>

2226
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:42,429
the net in their favor right this has

2227
01:20:40,420 --> 01:20:44,650
been successfully deployed in big

2228
01:20:42,429 --> 01:20:48,760
providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so big providers do</font>

2229
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:50,829
this right and here's an example you

2230
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:52,780
know one provider took about settlements

2231
01:20:50,829 --> 01:20:54,639
to go through it and start it on you

2232
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:57,280
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab this is over at Cisco</font>

2233
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:59,889
start at cisco lab unicast RPF and went

2234
01:20:57,280 --> 01:21:01,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">through on one router and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one you</font>

2235
01:20:59,889 --> 01:21:02,739
know one line card in one router then

2236
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:04,929
one rather face<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers</font>

2237
01:21:02,739 --> 01:21:06,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">and one pop and several routers and then</font>

2238
01:21:04,929 --> 01:21:08,530
finally adopted as a standard and went

2239
01:21:06,760 --> 01:21:10,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">through method but you know step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by step</font>

2240
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:12,489
methodology until it became a default

2241
01:21:10,329 --> 01:21:14,139
standard default config every new router

2242
01:21:12,489 --> 01:21:16,239
that came up was configured with this

2243
01:21:14,139 --> 01:21:18,130
they have total confidence around it so

2244
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,718
a lot of times if you're a big provider

2245
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:22,269
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this this is a matter of</font>

2246
01:21:19,719 --> 01:21:25,719
gaining confidence over time they get it

2247
01:21:22,269 --> 01:21:28,300
done and people have done it right so

2248
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:30,579
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done so took a lot of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

2249
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:32,800
lot of patience unicast RPF doesn't work

2250
01:21:30,579 --> 01:21:34,630
for all customers one of the big

2251
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:38,289
providers United States uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> X's list</font>

2252
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:42,039
there is unicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPL other big providers</font>

2253
01:21:38,289 --> 01:21:45,969
that states use a kiss RPF right other

2254
01:21:42,039 --> 01:21:49,179
big providers use<font color="#CCCCCC"> docsis three you know</font>

2255
01:21:45,969 --> 01:21:51,099
so there's different different big

2256
01:21:49,179 --> 01:21:54,190
providers all working<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so it</font>

2257
01:21:51,099 --> 01:21:55,989
works it out there so you know cut the

2258
01:21:54,190 --> 01:21:58,119
excuses people say oh I can't do it

2259
01:21:55,989 --> 01:22:00,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">because those lots of different ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

2260
01:21:58,119 --> 01:22:01,900
it's not just unique a star p up<font color="#CCCCCC"> acl's</font>

2261
01:22:00,670 --> 01:22:09,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's lots of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways of doing</font>

2262

it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay control plane protection whoops</font>

2263
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:16,570
there's bgp vgp security um you know

2264
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:17,678
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attack</font>

2265
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:19,058
vectors out there here's a couple of

2266
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,170
presentations that people can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

2267
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:24,699
you know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked about different</font>

2268
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:27,130
attack vectors of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp it's still you</font>

2269
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:27,339
know scary when you look at bgp and you

2270
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:30,730
say

2271
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:32,830
hmm what would happen if you know the

2272
01:22:30,730 --> 01:22:35,110
scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave earlier where you got</font>

2273
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:37,840
bad guys take 20 different routers and

2274
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:39,940
20 different locations of the world then

2275
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're bgp speaking routers & D</font>

2276
01:22:39,940 --> 01:22:45,809
aggravated in that all simultaneously

2277
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:48,519
what would happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the net some</font>

2278
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:50,739
interest in sort of things would happen

2279
01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:53,409
to do that everything from routers fail

2280
01:22:50,739 --> 01:22:55,598
an old fallen over because either there

2281
01:22:53,409 --> 01:22:57,460
are fibs or the ribs would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2282
01:22:55,599 --> 01:23:01,300
take take in you know that number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

2283
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:02,920
prefixes right<font color="#CCCCCC"> to flappin all over the</font>

2284
01:23:01,300 --> 01:23:04,869
place and then networks didn't

2285
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,969
disconnect it because flat dampen and

2286
01:23:04,869 --> 01:23:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">would knock them off to you know</font>

2287
01:23:06,969 --> 01:23:11,320
rerouted and traffic rerouted it's a

2288
01:23:09,010 --> 01:23:12,580
mess of different stress out there and

2289
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:15,340
it'll be one of those hard things to

2290
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:19,480
recover from but yet that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very real</font>

2291
01:23:15,340 --> 01:23:22,119
threat that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have today and the bad</font>

2292
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:23,709
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not doing it because the bad</font>

2293
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:26,259
guys need the Internet to stay up and

2294
01:23:23,710 --> 01:23:28,239
stable for them to make their money but

2295
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:30,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have politically oriented people and</font>

2296
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:33,730
terrorist out there who want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to disrupt</font>

2297
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:36,820
right so the threat vector around this

2298
01:23:33,730 --> 01:23:38,619
is actually even though you know bgp

2299
01:23:36,820 --> 01:23:40,030
hasn't changed much you know the

2300
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:41,320
importance of actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

2301
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:42,940
and making sure you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> things to</font>

2302
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:45,070
protect your control point is actually

2303
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:47,129
even more serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we got these</font>

2304
01:23:45,070 --> 01:23:49,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">things what we call home multi-vector</font>

2305
01:23:47,130 --> 01:23:52,929
terrorist incidents which is you take

2306
01:23:49,810 --> 01:23:54,820
for instance all<font color="#E5E5E5"> london with the two</font>

2307
01:23:52,929 --> 01:23:56,590
bombings imagine what will happen with

2308
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:59,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">london and two bombings and then</font>

2309
01:23:56,590 --> 01:24:01,360
somebody simultaneously d aggregate you

2310
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:02,949
know on 20 different routers bgp we're

2311
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:05,230
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> foreign systems are going down</font>

2312
01:24:02,949 --> 01:24:07,750
because this stuff impacts phone voice

2313
01:24:05,230 --> 01:24:09,610
and you haven't the cell phones off a

2314
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:11,949
telephone system off at a terrorist

2315
01:24:09,610 --> 01:24:16,449
attack and what you have in a population

2316
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:18,280
terror right so as that twenty percent

2317
01:24:16,449 --> 01:24:20,888
we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that never gets</font>

2318
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:22,030
fixed and the badness is never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2319
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,619
go away because we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a way to</font>

2320
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:25,630
knock down the doors and grab the guys

2321
01:24:23,619 --> 01:24:26,409
even though we know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're at you</font>

2322
01:24:25,630 --> 01:24:27,630
know because we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

2323
01:24:26,409 --> 01:24:29,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">international legal system and</font>

2324
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:32,199
convergence all happening this stuff

2325
01:24:29,889 --> 01:24:34,300
becomes more and more critical right so

2326
01:24:32,199 --> 01:24:37,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to walk through this right</font>

2327
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:39,460
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have time constraint but</font>

2328
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:40,570
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another from the nanog in new</font>

2329
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:41,980
york

2330
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:43,239
you know kind of keep and keep you know

2331
01:24:41,980 --> 01:24:48,519
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more detailed presentation</font>

2332
01:24:43,239 --> 01:24:50,709
on that so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> after bgp you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

2333
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:53,020
big macro cues that go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to be GPU can</font>

2334
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:54,820
saturate your your<font color="#CCCCCC"> queue paths you can</font>

2335
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,920
saturate the link you can drop the TCP

2336
01:24:54,820 --> 01:25:00,280
session you cause it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP to go down</font>

2337
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:02,530
recursive look up to attend right so

2338
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:05,099
social engineering attacking around

2339
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:07,840
device go into the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself right</font>

2340
01:25:05,099 --> 01:25:09,820
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the router you know and</font>

2341
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:11,619
we talked about this people go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

2342
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:13,119
breaking the routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> most common way is</font>

2343
01:25:11,619 --> 01:25:16,179
it go out there and look for your

2344
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:18,070
customer routers or a multi-homed most

2345
01:25:16,179 --> 01:25:21,070
common way of doing it is this scan for

2346
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:23,380
telnet and ssh and then when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> go on</font>

2347
01:25:21,070 --> 01:25:25,540
tenants uptown it and ssh what did you

2348
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:28,420
do first<font color="#CCCCCC"> passport did try a cisco so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

2349
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:30,610
can pass with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the choice juniper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

2350
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:33,670
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's what they</font>

2351
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:36,790
do and we you all have customers who do

2352
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:39,030
that sort of thing out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

2353
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:40,960
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> received punt pass this</font>

diagram how a lot of routers are built

2357
01:25:44,590 --> 01:25:48,909
you have an ASIC over here you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you got basically a big step down</font>

2368

here with a gigabyte of attack these<font color="#CCCCCC"> q</font>

2376
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:32,530
make resistance saturate the link by

dos attack link goes down<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and down up</font>

2382
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:51,559
and down you get what you call das flat

2383
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:53,660
as it goes up and down ok so these sort

2384
01:26:51,560 --> 01:26:55,520
of things with the das la paz a link

2385
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:58,040
goes up and down then cause flapping

2386
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,390
going on flat dampen it goes goes in

2387
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:02,210
there and you get dampened out you know

2388
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:05,720
it becomes even worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> top in the TCP</font>

2389
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:08,570
session right dropping the TCP session I

2390
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:11,150
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and I best certain things I</font>

2391
01:27:08,570 --> 01:27:14,330
can spoof all this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I just</font>

2392
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:18,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to guess in there back in 2004 it</font>

2393
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:21,980
was revealed that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP if you have</font>

2394
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:24,230
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> live tcp sessions okay then you can</font>

2395
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:25,519
sit there and start guessing all right

2396
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:27,200
and you got this thing called window

2397
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:29,300
hopping and you don't have to get as

2398
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,490
precise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all you have to do is get</font>

2399
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:32,840
inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the window which means you do</font>

2400
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:34,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this thing called window hopin you take</font>

2401
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:35,300
your sequence numbers and you just go

2402
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:37,990
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sequence number here's a</font>

2403
01:27:35,300 --> 01:27:40,400
sequencer you hop up the window<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

2404
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:42,889
we're talking about instead of tens of

2405
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:44,540
thousands of packets to knock down with

2406
01:27:42,890 --> 01:27:47,330
a reset we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about hundreds of</font>

2407
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:51,170
packets okay so that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in</font>

2408
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:53,330
2004 this<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't changed because this is</font>

2409
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:56,180
inherent the way TCP was built<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

2410
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:58,730
so this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP you know resiliency</font>

2411
01:27:56,180 --> 01:28:00,650
issue but if you're not mindful of this

2412
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:02,839
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you leave you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BZ PCF sessions open</font>

2413
01:28:00,650 --> 01:28:05,660
where people can telnet and get a TCP

2414
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:07,610
packet to that bgp session then it's

2415
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:08,990
vulnerable to this right infrastructure

2416
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:10,460
access list and some of the other

2417
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:13,190
techniques this is what you use to take

2418
01:28:10,460 --> 01:28:16,070
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this this is also where this</font>

2419
01:28:13,190 --> 01:28:18,019
technique TTL security mechanism right

2420
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:19,490
yes don't put for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Mexican upper</font>

2421
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:21,260
we actually get in the feature make it

2422
01:28:19,490 --> 01:28:23,120
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to collegiate to</font>

2423
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:25,520
make it work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> juniper but the TTL</font>

2424
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:27,380
security mechanism is set up where a lot

2425
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:30,440
of bgp sessions you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

2426
01:28:27,380 --> 01:28:32,360
especially bgp ebgp sessions you know

2427
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,669
when I appearing with somebody we're

2428
01:28:32,360 --> 01:28:36,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">right next to each other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

2429
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:39,230
what you're doing is you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

2430
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:41,420
when the packet leaves like over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here at</font>

2431
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:45,259
Romans router and reaches my router is

2432
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:47,780
TTL is 255 right now by the time that

2433
01:28:45,260 --> 01:28:50,810
packet reason reaches my<font color="#CCCCCC"> btp process</font>

2434
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:52,880
you'll either be TTL 245 or 250 for

2435
01:28:50,810 --> 01:28:54,159
depends where I decrement it's very

2436
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation dependent</font>

2437
01:28:54,159 --> 01:29:01,119
so all I need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check and say are you a</font>

2438
01:28:56,439 --> 01:29:03,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">TKE TTL 255 or 254 right do I check if</font>

2439
01:29:01,119 --> 01:29:06,429
I'm like something larger then you're

2440
01:29:03,729 --> 01:29:08,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">not one hop away from me all right so</font>

2441
01:29:06,429 --> 01:29:11,729
there's lightweight technique so GT sm

2442
01:29:08,619 --> 01:29:13,989
general-purpose TTL security math is a

2443
01:29:11,729 --> 01:29:15,999
mechanism is one of the techniques out

2444
01:29:13,989 --> 01:29:18,669
there you can use to defend and build

2445
01:29:15,999 --> 01:29:21,489
more resiliency with it not

2446
01:29:18,669 --> 01:29:23,889
authentication hopefully we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out</font>

2447
01:29:21,489 --> 01:29:27,669
of TC p.m. it's stuck in TC p.m. but

2448
01:29:23,889 --> 01:29:31,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll get the update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to md5 problem of</font>

2449
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:33,130
md5 out there today is mb5 is as I've

2450
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:36,188
said for years even though it adds

2451
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:37,809
resiliency if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it deployed</font>

2452
01:29:36,189 --> 01:29:40,419
today I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend applying it</font>

2453
01:29:37,809 --> 01:29:43,749
you use GT sm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is because</font>

2454
01:29:40,419 --> 01:29:45,489
you know when md5 was created we didn't

2455
01:29:43,749 --> 01:29:46,869
have mission critical services and

2456
01:29:45,489 --> 01:29:50,949
multiple services with one BJP

2457
01:29:46,869 --> 01:29:52,719
connection md5 you know um you don't

2458
01:29:50,949 --> 01:29:54,610
have a key and you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be changing</font>

2459
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,289
the key over time the problem of md5 is

2460
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:59,110
do a key exchange and changing the key

2461
01:29:56,289 --> 01:30:01,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">drops</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accession you reset the session</font>

2462
01:29:59,110 --> 01:30:04,239
all right now there's some Kluge's that

2463
01:30:01,809 --> 01:30:06,070
we did halfway the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lotan for is IETF to</font>

2464
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:07,388
come out they have you no arguments

2465
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:10,030
about the correct way of doing where we

2466
01:30:07,389 --> 01:30:12,070
can actually we set a key without

2467
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:13,869
dropping the session that's our problems

2468
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:15,820
that then be five today you know some

2469
01:30:13,869 --> 01:30:19,030
people say oh you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use md5 the</font>

2470
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:20,768
problem with nd5 is you know we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

2471
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:22,719
links or multiple services some of those

2472
01:30:20,769 --> 01:30:24,639
services or regulated services you can't

2473
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:27,010
just keep on changing the key drop on

2474
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:28,809
those sessions<font color="#E5E5E5"> off not not a good thing</font>

2475
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:30,639
anymore but hopefully we'll get we'll

2476
01:30:28,809 --> 01:30:35,739
get this coming IETF soon with it so

2477
01:30:30,639 --> 01:30:40,749
does md5 stop you know up there droppin

2478
01:30:35,739 --> 01:30:42,638
<font color="#CCCCCC">IGP you know ospf and I eigrp open one</font>

2479
01:30:40,749 --> 01:30:44,949
of the reasons why people have moved is

2480
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:47,939
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and different networks one of the</font>

2481
01:30:44,949 --> 01:30:52,360
reasons they justify to use is is is too

2482
01:30:47,939 --> 01:30:53,679
it's not often attackable<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so I</font>

2483
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:55,478
can't sit in the one side of the world

2484
01:30:53,679 --> 01:31:00,309
and send it packing across and try to go

2485
01:30:55,479 --> 01:31:01,840
after the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp right so you know the so</font>

2486
01:31:00,309 --> 01:31:03,729
the several providers who have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

2487
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:05,420
sort of migration with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm</font>

2488
01:31:03,729 --> 01:31:09,360
going after thy GT

01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:11,040
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pakistan issue mentioned this</font>

here's the length of the Pakistan issue

2494
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:19,230
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were told to they didn't</font>

2495
01:31:17,850 --> 01:31:21,270
like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> videos that they did about</font>

2496
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:22,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Pakistan government and that the</font>

01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:24,239
government says remove these videos and

2498
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:27,150
they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can't so it's okay</font>

2499
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:28,830

2501
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:33,780
technique I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about but they didn't</font>

2502
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:35,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">put no no export so because they didn't</font>

filter Murphy filter is what I call a

2505
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:43,710
filter of last resort so at vgp I use

2506
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:44,820
this Murphy's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Murfreesboro networking</font>

write anything can go wrong will go

2508
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:48,480
wrong so even though you put no export

2509
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:50,070
you can put another filter and say don't

2510
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:51,629
export these communities know as you do

out there and do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do that</font>

there and if anybody wants to look at

01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:40,890
how bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can get way back the 707</font>

01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:52,530
why they weren't impacted was you know

2536
01:32:49,949 --> 01:32:55,559
what happened with 707 flooded out

2537
01:32:52,530 --> 01:32:57,780
through the network but this garbage in

garbage out happened cause a lot of

because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got another tutorial you can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">look up on aggressive prefix filtering</font>

the aggressive people expel<font color="#CCCCCC"> term is</font>

2547
01:33:11,340 --> 01:33:15,210
where you say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't accept any bgp</font>

2548
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:18,410
packet coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to me I actually select</font>

2549
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:21,560
what I come in I select on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on boundaries</font>

2550
01:33:18,410 --> 01:33:22,940
and there's there's a loose mode of

2551
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,320
doing it and there's a strict mode of

2552
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:26,480
doing it a strict mode of doing it is

where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go through and say here's what</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the regional registries say they're</font>

2556
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:36,200
take the boundaries that they give and

2557
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:39,080
i'll be very strict on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then the</font>

2561
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:47,240
techniques have proved especially during

2562
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:50,450
the 707 those service bars we're doing

2563
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:53,450
similar to that did not get<font color="#E5E5E5"> impacted by</font>

2564
01:33:50,450 --> 01:33:54,769
this right so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is kind of protecting</font>

2565
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:56,450
yourself because somebody's can be

sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on other side of the planet the</font>

2567
01:33:56,450 --> 01:34:00,710
aggregate the net right and are you

01:33:58,970 --> 01:34:04,040
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to select a you know except all</font>

these last 30 tues all right where's

01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">your boundary at what will you accept</font>

2571
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:13,010
right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll flip through you know flip</font>

2577
01:34:26,810 --> 01:34:31,150
is doing all the filtering with it so

2578
01:34:33,770 --> 01:34:38,360
and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever need slides to explain</font>

01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:42,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">all this get the slide right here at for</font>

your management total visibility

telemetry this is what you're doing

2582
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:52,160
total visibility telemetry this is not a

2583
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:54,260
new concept and you go through military

2584
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,490
realms you go to power systems and

2585
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:56,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got to have a full</font>

situational view what's happening on

2587
01:34:56,900 --> 01:35:02,019
your network the more data you can get

2588
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:03,710
in in cost-effective way the better

2589
01:35:02,020 --> 01:35:05,660
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us there's a lot of</font>

2590
01:35:03,710 --> 01:35:07,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-effective ways of bringing data in</font>

2591
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:08,690
to your network operations center to

2592
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:11,330
give you visibility what's happening

2593
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:12,769
with it we have access to lots of data

2594
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:14,600
you can stream off of routers and

2595
01:35:12,770 --> 01:35:16,550
switches we have lots of probes and

2596
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:18,500
sensors we can pull off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so</font>

2597
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

2598
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:24,080
important so<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple things like SNMP arm</font>

2599
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:25,250
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> net flow right so there's there's a</font>

2600
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:26,360
lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> addendums</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've put on</font>

2601
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">here where you can pull off some of the</font>

2602
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:30,170
data this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a chart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Roland</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dominance it is is it's quite</font>

2604
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:33,800
good because what you're doing is a

2605
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:37,730
holistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach looking at the whole</font>

2606
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:39,320
body the whole system right and look

2607
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:42,080
into the interactions between all the

2608
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:43,519
different components method right so you

2609
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:44,660
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to listen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

2610
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,750
components of network and different

2611
01:35:44,660 --> 01:35:50,330
parts correlate it all together right so

2612
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:52,370
and fortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's tools out there</font>

2613
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:55,040
that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go out there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

2614
01:35:52,370 --> 01:35:56,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">in by right away now of course you have</font>

2615
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,730
companies like you know over networks as

2616
01:35:56,630 --> 01:36:00,950
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little stuff right away but in no way</font>

2617
01:35:58,730 --> 01:36:02,719
of doing this I've recommended people is

2618
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:06,380
go download the free<font color="#CCCCCC"> where stuff first</font>

2619
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:08,540
and fire at the fever stuff all right

2620
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:10,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the freeware stuff you don't you</font>

2621
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:12,769
know your capital cost is basically

2622
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:14,870
servers with this space and open source

2623
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:16,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools all right and freeware tools you</font>

2624
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:17,840
load on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then when that open</font>

2625
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:19,849
source tools you start seeing what sort

2626
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:21,320
of data you can get and then that kept

2627
01:36:19,850 --> 01:36:23,270
all starts giving you an indication of

2628
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">what sort of vendors you want to look at</font>

2629
01:36:23,270 --> 01:36:26,570
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple vendors who will</font>

2630
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:28,400
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring this stuff down but at</font>

2631
01:36:26,570 --> 01:36:31,009
least you broke the ice and with your

2632
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,629
bosses right if you get permission you

2633
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:35,120
say hey we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start looking at this</font>

2634
01:36:32,630 --> 01:36:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and looking at flow data all right</font>

2635
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:39,349
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> float out of going into my network</font>

2636
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:41,269
your bosses will be more likely to

2637
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:44,150
upgrade what you have if you've started

2638
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:45,650
started from freeware stuff right

2639
01:36:44,150 --> 01:36:47,599
because now they're seeing the data

2640
01:36:45,650 --> 01:36:50,660
especially if you take the down

2641
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:52,280
I given them in reports all right you

2642
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:54,139
start giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> them given product managers</font>

2643
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:55,880
reports you know here's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

2644
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:57,530
my network because this is only not only

2645
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:59,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">for security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is for understanding</font>

what's happening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network what do</font>

2647
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:02,420
your services are doing what sort of

2648
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:03,500
performance things are happening there's

2649
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:05,540
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things you can do</font>

2650
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:07,880
with this flow data you know you got

01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:09,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">steger out there you got you know SNMP</font>

01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:14,810
different you know spikes with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> armaan</font>

2654
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,860
you notice to got a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> armaan going</font>

2655
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:17,870
on switches a lot of switching

2656
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:20,630
technology out there you know here's an

2657
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:22,940
example of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp monitor and bgp itself</font>

2658
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:24,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right bgp actually had operations</font>

2659
01:37:22,940 --> 01:37:26,570
that happen with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

2660
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">like oh let's look at net flow you want</font>

2661
01:37:26,570 --> 01:37:29,570
to look appens with your routing

protocols and graph that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

2663
01:37:29,570 --> 01:37:33,410
your routing protocols would get you

2664
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:35,660
indications what happens with you take

2665
01:37:33,410 --> 01:37:38,180
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hour burn packet design both have</font>

2666
01:37:35,660 --> 01:37:39,620
where they take the protocols in and you

2667
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:41,960
look at the routing protocols for

2668
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:43,760
stability resiliency also<font color="#E5E5E5"> for security</font>

2669
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:48,560
you can correlate and see stuff happens

2670
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:52,460
with security<font color="#E5E5E5"> aspects of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah</font>

2671
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:54,800
there's a sound effect with it so and

2672
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:56,480
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> correlate the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with with the</font>

2673
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,910
flow data and a route and data together

2674
01:37:56,480 --> 01:38:00,860
you can see what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

2675
01:37:58,910 --> 01:38:02,660
impact with it now where this all comes

2676
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:05,030
in with total visibility is there's a

2677
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:07,220
there's a theme we're heading down and

2678
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:09,259
the thing we're heading down is when

2679
01:38:07,220 --> 01:38:10,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">people say well I'm doing all this SP</font>

2680
01:38:09,260 --> 01:38:13,190
security stuff and starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these</font>

2681
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:14,450
top tech deck<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten techniques and you</font>

2682
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:17,480
manageable to say well how do I know

2683
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:21,800
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is working how do I know this is</font>

2684
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:26,059
going to work fortunately for us we now

2685
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:29,090
know how to measure this it's called a

2686
01:38:26,060 --> 01:38:32,080
service level agreement it's an SLA you

2687
01:38:29,090 --> 01:38:34,040
give to yourself so what I call is

2688
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:35,809
basically set up a server full agreement

2689
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:38,720
with yourself internally it's like an

2690
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:41,060
SLA<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and it's the service level</font>

2691
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:42,710
tools that we use them for SLA that you

2692
01:38:41,060 --> 01:38:44,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">give for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your customer the IP p.m. tool</font>

2693
01:38:42,710 --> 01:38:46,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">set you take the IP p.m. toolset you</font>

2694
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:50,180
deploy in your network and that becomes

2695
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:51,710
your measure because any sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dos</font>

2696
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:54,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">attack security tax things like that</font>

2697
01:38:51,710 --> 01:38:56,330
becomes SLA variations and you can

2698
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:57,920
measure that and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> count that and</font>

2699
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:59,780
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an effective this tool to find</font>

2700
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:01,080
out whether it's working or not whether

2701
01:38:59,780 --> 01:39:03,540
these tools you use

2702
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:05,040
techniques<font color="#CCCCCC"> use when stuff happens how</font>

2703
01:39:03,540 --> 01:39:07,050
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you measure it how can you go to</font>

2704
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,720
your bosses every year it says how many

2705
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:11,760
SLA impact and dos attacks that we have

2706
01:39:09,720 --> 01:39:13,710
and that's the exact that's what you

2707
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:15,990
want to talk to your<font color="#CCCCCC"> boss with how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

2708
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:18,750
sl8 impact and dos attacks that we had

2709
01:39:15,990 --> 01:39:21,150
how long did it take to<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve those s</font>

2710
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:23,850
elite impact and dos attacks how many

2711
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:25,769
FCC reportable boss attacks that we have

2712
01:39:23,850 --> 01:39:28,410
right how many voice impacted dos

2713
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:30,210
attacks we have right and you can count

2714
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:32,519
these and then measure the effectiveness

2715
01:39:30,210 --> 01:39:36,000
of what how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> it took to restore the</font>

2716
01:39:32,520 --> 01:39:39,780
SLA level thus attack happened here at<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font>

2717
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:42,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">0 it took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me 10 minutes to fix it okay</font>

2718
01:39:39,780 --> 01:39:45,030
it's immeasurable now the measurement is

2719
01:39:42,690 --> 01:39:46,139
about the visibility and that's where

2720
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:50,340
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting on with the visibility</font>

2721
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:53,190
because hype es la right the IP p.m.

2722
01:39:50,340 --> 01:39:55,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">tool set is visibility its visibility</font>

2723
01:39:53,190 --> 01:39:57,210
let you see jitter packing performance

2724
01:39:55,290 --> 01:40:00,120
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the network right so using</font>

2725
01:39:57,210 --> 01:40:03,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">them all that syslog right MTP right</font>

2726
01:40:00,120 --> 01:40:05,490
correlation with that packet captures

2727
01:40:03,180 --> 01:40:07,890
right all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the visibility so let</font>

2728
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:10,500
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> give an example so we close up close</font>

2729
01:40:07,890 --> 01:40:13,560
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working the attack so</font>

2730
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:15,570
das attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sol a violation packet goes</font>

2731
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:17,190
in there goes in tax and network what

2732
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:20,549
you told a boss alright so I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an SLA</font>

2733
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:23,370
violation over here right so what you're

2734
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:25,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do is figure out what to do</font>

2735
01:40:23,370 --> 01:40:27,390
with this packing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an internet</font>

2736
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:28,530
when a packet was in the network one of

2737
01:40:27,390 --> 01:40:30,720
two things always going to happen that

2738
01:40:28,530 --> 01:40:32,460
packet number one the pack<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going</font>

2739
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:33,690
to get delivered number two sometimes

2740
01:40:32,460 --> 01:40:36,780
somebody's going to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it to get</font>

2741
01:40:33,690 --> 01:40:39,419
dropped somebody's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for it</font>

2742
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:42,090
to get dropped all right now is that

2743
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:43,290
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> your router because are</font>

2744
01:40:42,090 --> 01:40:44,580
going to be your customers runner right

2745
01:40:43,290 --> 01:40:47,610
who can taste where to get dropped so

2746
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:49,410
use that six phases so our sitrep here

2747
01:40:47,610 --> 01:40:51,660
is everything's normal all right then

2748
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:53,790
alarm<font color="#E5E5E5"> goods goes off target is getting</font>

2749
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:57,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">take tout I got collateral damage going</font>

2750
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:59,070
on right so now with the attack in

2751
01:40:57,570 --> 01:41:01,500
progress so I got a collateral damage

2752
01:40:59,070 --> 01:41:03,809
incident so I only got a customer

2753
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:06,180
screaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customer may not a call be</font>

2754
01:41:03,810 --> 01:41:08,130
a customer none of the DOS attack what I

2755
01:41:06,180 --> 01:41:12,030
do know is my alarms went off how<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

2756
01:41:08,130 --> 01:41:13,650
a PE router down ok so my alarms and my

2757
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">Knox's PE routers down I got a DOS</font>

2758
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:16,799
attack in progress

2759
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:20,429
collateral damage so what's the first

2760
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:22,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing you do this is a triage fixed a</font>

2761
01:41:20,429 --> 01:41:23,969
collateral damage don't fix the customer

2762
01:41:22,349 --> 01:41:26,699
problem fix the collateral damage<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

2763
01:41:23,969 --> 01:41:28,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">right solve the cloud a magician so I'm</font>

2764
01:41:26,699 --> 01:41:29,940
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the customer sacrifice the</font>

2765
01:41:28,650 --> 01:41:31,920
customer and said I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to push his</font>

2766
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:33,989
dos attack back all right i'll do a

2767
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:35,610
rotor go black hole so now I got the

2768
01:41:33,989 --> 01:41:38,040
collateral damage mitigated I pushed

2769
01:41:35,610 --> 01:41:39,960
attack up all my other customers are

2770
01:41:38,040 --> 01:41:42,449
restored that customer is still hit by

2771
01:41:39,960 --> 01:41:46,139
the attack so now I got the guy as a

2772
01:41:42,449 --> 01:41:49,110
partial service so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> restored partial</font>

2773
01:41:46,139 --> 01:41:50,190
service dos attack is still active now

2774
01:41:49,110 --> 01:41:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to go through and I got some</font>

2775
01:41:50,190 --> 01:41:53,610
options where's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toolkit I can use a</font>

2776
01:41:52,110 --> 01:41:55,650
sinkhole I can watch the doss<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

2777
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:58,290
activate clean pipes so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

2778
01:41:55,650 --> 01:42:00,269
is I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

2779
01:41:58,290 --> 01:42:01,769
do community-based drops no trigger

2780
01:42:00,270 --> 01:42:03,900
black hole<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can set up by communities</font>

2781
01:42:01,770 --> 01:42:05,849
and drops in different sections<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

2782
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:08,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so what I'm going to do here is</font>

2783
01:42:05,849 --> 01:42:09,840
I'm going to monitor your attack use btb

2784
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:11,820
communicate and send to one of my

2785
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:15,059
regional sinkholes so what I'm going to

2786
01:42:11,820 --> 01:42:17,429
do is over here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use a community-based</font>

2787
01:42:15,059 --> 01:42:18,360
trigger and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say ok this I'm</font>

2788
01:42:17,429 --> 01:42:20,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see which one goes to a</font>

2789
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:22,079
sinkhole and says okay over here this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

2790
01:42:20,790 --> 01:42:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">the one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went to the sinkhole so I</font>

2791
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:25,769
know the attack is coming in from this

2792
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:28,139
section<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my country on my network all</font>

2793
01:42:25,770 --> 01:42:30,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and send it over to a sinkhole now</font>

2794
01:42:28,139 --> 01:42:31,920
inside the sinkhole I go and I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

2795
01:42:30,270 --> 01:42:34,170
analyze it so now I go in here it says

2796
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:36,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DOS attack is still active</font>

2797
01:42:34,170 --> 01:42:38,369
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide a customer with</font>

2798
01:42:36,179 --> 01:42:40,050
some clean pipe service let's say now I

2799
01:42:38,369 --> 01:42:43,019
can do a clean pipe service over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

2800
01:42:40,050 --> 01:42:45,449
so now clean pipe service is a full

2801
01:42:43,020 --> 01:42:47,880
service recovery this is one where

2802
01:42:45,449 --> 01:42:50,480
they're under attack and they're going
