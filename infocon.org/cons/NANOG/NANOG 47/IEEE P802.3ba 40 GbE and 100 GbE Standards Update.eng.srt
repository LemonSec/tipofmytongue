1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:08,820
good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone it's been about a</font>

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,860
year since the last update so there have

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,960
been many interesting developments and I

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,759
have to show you my standard disclaimer

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,560
slide I don't represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I Triple E</font>

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,150
and these are all my opinion so why

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,709
hasn't there been an update recently I

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,840
kind of was thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when I</font>

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,609
was putting the slides together and you

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,289
know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> when this all started out there</font>

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,689
were lots of changes there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lots of</font>

12
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,230
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to report and lots of news and I</font>

13
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,480
think in two thousand six or 2007 I gave

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,610
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten updates around the world on</font>

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,828
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in the I Triple E and</font>

16
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,660
then things kind of slowed down as far

17
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,700
as new developments not necessarily as

18
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:47,190
far as what type of work was going on

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,440
the work just kind of got boring from an

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,410
operational standpoint because they

21
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,829
started to work on draft 10 and got way

22
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,788
way deep in the electrical and

23
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:59,100
specifications and then start this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

24
00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,739
called common resolution which is

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:05,339
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a room about half this</font>

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,020
size criticizes every word in the draft

27
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,570
and they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a ticketing</font>

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,520
system so every comment is put into a

29
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,339
ticketing system and then they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,570
it to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's resolved it</font>

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,869
could be a number of things technical

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,699
changes formatting spelling mistakes all

33
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,500
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of things so it's an enormous</font>

34
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,229
amount of work but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not very</font>

35
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,689
exciting to report on so a recent

36
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,820
developments draft tuta tuta was

37
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,100
finished in<font color="#E5E5E5"> august and the I Triple E</font>

38
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:34,350
calls this the crossing eyes and dotting

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,240
T's it's a subtle sense of humor that

40
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,399
they have over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but funny</font>

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,500
nonetheless and the big things that

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're working on is called the sponsor</font>

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:49,560
ballot and then giraffe 30 bottom line

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,360
is things are on schedule for 2010 so

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,890
you've seen this slide before but I did

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,780
it in a slightly different form at this

47
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,840
time and there are some things that have

48
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,369
changed since last year again as the I

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,780
Triple E starts to work on things they

50
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,860
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know this was a good</font>

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,960
idea but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not going to work</font>

52
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,180
practically your things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

53
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,008
change is that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,110
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a copper interface it used</font>

55
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:12,119
to be 10 meters over copper cable now

56
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,610
the distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 7 meters</font>

57
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,650
based on the technology limitations and

58
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,980
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were available today the</font>

59
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:23,370
other thing that was added is for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100</font>

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:26,340
meter on multimode they've also added a

61
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,330
125 meter on om for fiber so they

62
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,459
figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that they can go a little</font>

63
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,650
bit farther on for which is a little

64
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:33,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">better fiber gives you a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font>

65
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,400
distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

66
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,829
added is now that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting close to</font>

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,390
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty standard product out</font>

68
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:41,159
there are a lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can tell</font>

69
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,809
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the media and now it's</font>

70
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:46,019
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to look operationally so</font>

71
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,120
I have a line on each of the distances

72
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,400
and speeds that tells you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

73
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,140
media is going to be and what kind of

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,959
module what kind of media module is

75
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:58,440
going to be so you'll see a lot of talk

76
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,000
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> cfp cfp is kind of the one module</font>

77
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,530
that everyone is working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,090
standardizing tours and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a couple</font>

79
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides on all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different type of</font>

80
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,209
media coming up so for those of you that

81
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,970
are wondering about these very

82
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,379
interesting names like 40<font color="#E5E5E5"> G base</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> KR for</font>

83
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have a table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the reference section</font>

84
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:20,340
that tells you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decode that so</font>

85
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i skip over this slide or i put</font>

86
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,470
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the back but i wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on</font>

87
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:28,530
it this time and specifically really

88
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about what it means to you so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

89
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:33,569
important things as far as the I Triple

90
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:36,359
E is concerned are the draft so you see

91
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,010
a draft 10 to 20 and 30 and these are

92
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,109
milestones that the I Triple E has to

93
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,929
meet<font color="#E5E5E5"> because something happens that</font>

94
00:03:40,109 --> 00:03:45,030
corresponds to that so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example for</font>

95
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,720
giraffe 10 you see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top is</font>

96
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">taskforce review 30 is the ballot which</font>

97
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,980
is the important one that's the one that

98
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,108
they're working towards right now so the

99
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,160
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out is that you</font>

100
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:58,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">know when you talk about how to get</font>

101
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:01,319
product onto the market it's a spectrum

102
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:03,268
and a very careful balance so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that</font>

103
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,970
as kind of a spectrum line at the bottom

104
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,090
it's it's very difficult to figure out

105
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,680
how to do market timing based on where

106
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,500
the standards are going and what stage

107
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,629
the standards around right now so for

108
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,149
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a silicon vendor if</font>

109
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:20,519
you implement way too early and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then put</font>

110
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,760
your silicon out there already and then

111
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,050
the

112
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,760
have changes you're going to have to

113
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:27,780
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> your silicon and that could be a</font>

114
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,280
six months to a year process the optics

115
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,140
vendors have a challenge<font color="#CCCCCC"> too because</font>

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,969
they're trying to build form factors and

117
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,380
the switch router vendors are trying to

118
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:37,410
take all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things and put it into a</font>

119
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,230
line card so kind of as you look at the

120
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:43,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the development of the standard if you</font>

121
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,960
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at 2008 and what was going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on there</font>

122
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,000
2008 was when there was lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of news to</font>

123
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">report they were changed the objectives</font>

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,200
and it was just way too early to

125
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:54,210
implement<font color="#E5E5E5"> because no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really knew</font>

126
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,909
what the final objectives were going to

127
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:59,419
be so those were then adopted for f1 not

128
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">0 comes out has baseline proposals</font>

129
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,100
baseline proposals on feasibility not

130
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:06,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily technically complete so at</font>

131
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:08,160
this point people<font color="#E5E5E5"> were starting to think</font>

132
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,320
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what can we do how are we</font>

133
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,670
going to do this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scoping out</font>

134
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,400
implementation ideas draft 20 was really

135
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,650
the big milestone because if you look at

136
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,349
let's see that's July that's the last

137
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:25,500
technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> change so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was draft 22</font>

138
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:27,480
that was finished in the August so now

139
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,250
there are no more technical changes so

140
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,500
we've already seen some NSA is being

141
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,600
formed msa's are just a bunch of vendors

142
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,120
getting together to build a product so

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,240
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> msa's for all the new media that</font>

144
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,430
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need and we've also seen a number of</font>

145
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">first generation pre standard components</font>

146
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,900
and interfaces hit the market and we've

147
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,420
also seen technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrations so</font>

148
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">again as you get closer to drive 30</font>

149
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,700
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are becoming final people can</font>

150
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:55,590
start to do more<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drop 3 dot 0</font>

151
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,510
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said is the big is really the big</font>

152
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">next goal because that's when it goes to</font>

153
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ballot to be approved for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the final</font>

154
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,550
standards track not necessarily the

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,640
final standard but it's a complicated

156
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,340
process so anyway so it's a big deal for

157
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,979
the next vote and that's what you're

158
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,440
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see I think towards the end of</font>

159
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then spring after draft 30</font>

160
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,560
I think we'll see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

161
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,480
announcements about interfaces and

162
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,560
that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are really starting</font>

163
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:26,910
to ramp up for for volume production and

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,460
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and things hitting the market</font>

165
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:32,040
and then in 2010 when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standards</font>

166
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,450
available you might think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

167
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:35,700
things are done well actually that's

168
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,930
when the real fun starts because that's

169
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,930
when people<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to work on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font>

170
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,540
generation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology so you know you</font>

171
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:44,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial technology and cost and</font>

172
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:47,190
constraints that you're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and</font>

173
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,930
as technology changes does become

174
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,110
cheaper so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> always going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

175
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,450
something new that's on the road map if

176
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,130
you look at 10 gig for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

177
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,300
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 cake first came out it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a big</font>

178
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:03,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">300 pin laser that was on there and now</font>

179
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,280
we have sfp+ which is you know tiny so

180
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:10,080
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how those technology changes</font>

181
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,250
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to affect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 40 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

182
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I said most of these things</font>

183
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:15,810
already so again the big important thing

184
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,300
about giraffe 220 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's technically</font>

185
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,750
complete the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> achill change was in</font>

186
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,520
2009<font color="#CCCCCC"> July and we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of first</font>

187
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,900
generation and pre standard components

188
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,900
on the market so this is really good

189
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,669
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of media modules the</font>

190
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,370
cabling systems have actually been

191
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:35,370
readily available already and I have a

192
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,650
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides on the cabling test gear</font>

193
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,770
and network year we've had technology

194
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:43,080
demonstrations I know exia had pre

195
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,810
standard 40 gig in 100 gig interfaces<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

196
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,180
interrupt that they were demonstrating

197
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,880
bunch of the media vendors just had a

198
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,860
big demo at this conference in i think

199
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,800
it was in<font color="#CCCCCC"> vienna last September so they</font>

200
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,540
demonstrated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4100 gig cfp modules</font>

201
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the ethernet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alliance has been</font>

202
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,360
holding seminars and running white

203
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,830
papers and and having education efforts

204
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,850
for the past several years all along so

205
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,510
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the message out</font>

206
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:12,120
there about ethernet let's talk a little

207
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,280
bit about the new media modules and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

208
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,570
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to now that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we finally know what</font>

209
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,419
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to look like I can put in</font>

210
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,230
some pictures and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea of</font>

211
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:22,310
operational issues that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

212
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:25,860
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this qsfp has been around</font>

213
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,630
for a while it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new thing that's</font>

214
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,730
already used in<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfiniBand and then</font>

215
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,849
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to extend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the use to to 40</font>

216
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,770
gig short-range<font color="#E5E5E5"> interfaces the thing to</font>

217
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:36,330
remember about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is that it's it's</font>

218
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:39,179
really targeted for<font color="#E5E5E5"> high density and</font>

219
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,630
data center applications and the way it

220
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,120
looks I just did

221
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:44,620
google image search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for qsfp and and now</font>

222
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,400
this is what came up but it's a copper

223
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,900
or a fiber cable assembly and has four

224
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,610
channels it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> low power</font>

225
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,990
consumption so you know vendors love

226
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:57,790
that because you can make your equipment

227
00:08:52,990 --> 00:09:00,820
really dense cxp module this is a a

228
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,640
relatively new module it's not it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

229
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:05,620
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new it's already used its</font>

230
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,640
proposed to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> InfiniBand and</font>

231
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">100 PK interfaces I has 12 channels so</font>

232
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,790
obviously 100 gig would only use 10 of

233
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,100
the 12 channels and again this is a

234
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:17,290
short reach interface low power

235
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,720
consumption it's small its compact it's

236
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:22,089
about the size of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex FP and this</font>

237
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,940
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cable assembly as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

238
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:27,220
a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Finisar fiber assembly</font>

239
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,230
but obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred get copper would</font>

240
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,240
be some sort of twinax cable that that

241
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:36,970
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> connected to a cxp and then cfp so</font>

242
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,370
this is the new module that's been

243
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:42,280
developed specifically for mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> hunter</font>

244
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,040
gig but there are also some 40 gig CFCF

245
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,560
p modules this is a you know it's a big

246
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,689
honkin<font color="#E5E5E5"> laser so it's a lot bigger it</font>

247
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,550
consumes a lot more power but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do</font>

248
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,190
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more with it so from a design</font>

249
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,719
standpoint there's lots of electrical

250
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:58,210
connectors on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have lots</font>

251
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of channels into the media you can kind</font>

252
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:01,120
of do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some cool things I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if</font>

253
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,670
you were at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beer in here last night</font>

254
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,350
but alcatel actually had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have</font>

255
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,599
to pick it up and hold it so it's about

256
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,610
twice as big as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zen pack for those of</font>

257
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,890
you that don't remember xenpak that's

258
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,480
about this big cfp is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big and</font>

259
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:20,380
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some examples of all the things</font>

260
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,150
that people are doing with cfp so again

261
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,700
100 gig and 40 gig there's a variety

262
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,770
combinations this one the reflex

263
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,530
photonics one is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

264
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,380
see they actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 40 gig ports in</font>

265
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,339
one media module so that's an

266
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,970
interesting thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can do with</font>

267
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and you'll notice that on the reflex</font>

268
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,450
photonics modules there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

269
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:42,790
weird-looking connector that you might

270
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:43,710
not have seen before so that's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPO</font>

271
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,530
connector

272
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:50,130
talk about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a little bit oh and</font>

273
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:52,050
this here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpo mpo is a wonderfully</font>

274
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,120
strange acronym it means multi-fiber

275
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:56,459
push on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know who came up with</font>

276
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,190
that but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically a high density</font>

277
00:10:56,460 --> 00:11:01,050
cabling system I've never seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

278
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,630
deployed today but I did a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

279
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,880
googling and there's a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cable</font>

280
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,350
systems for<font color="#E5E5E5"> MP 0 2 MP 0 and then those</font>

281
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,450
these cassettes that you put into patch

282
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,190
panels that have a breakout on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back</font>

283
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:13,230
or you can just get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a breakout cable</font>

284
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,410
into SC or LC or whatever but so it's

285
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:20,040
basically a<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-density cabling system</font>

286
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:22,500
with parallel fibers so for 40 gig it's

287
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,599
a 12 fiber<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpo and then 400 gig it's a</font>

288
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,030
24 fiber<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpo again not all of them are</font>

289
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,790
used but that's just the packaging that

290
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:31,020
the cabling comes in and you know I was

291
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:34,620
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so this is going to</font>

292
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">make cross connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a challenge so people</font>

293
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,580
that provide infrastructure and data

294
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,770
centers are going to have to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

295
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:44,210
how to do this if operators actually

296
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:46,770
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpo or kind of cross connects and</font>

297
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:50,370
then switches and routers again so

298
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:51,900
alcatel had a cool card on display last

299
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,720
night you<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to pick it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up and hold it</font>

300
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,800
a lot of vendors have announced 200 gigs

301
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,180
per slot so the usual suspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

302
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:02,400
capabilities for 40 gig and then hunter

303
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,930
gig alcohol and juniper had the first

304
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:06,630
hunter gig interface announcements

305
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,859
earlier this year so kind of cool and

306
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,500
again you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

307
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">cfp medium and then you know like I said</font>

308
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:15,060
after drive 320<font color="#E5E5E5"> November I think we're</font>

309
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:16,979
going to see a slew of announcements for

310
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:22,260
more priests and her stuffs or the fall

311
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,990
or winter and then spring in 2010 so

312
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:27,150
again what to expect so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

313
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,160
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> generation of Technology it's</font>

314
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,590
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be somewhat expensive and it's</font>

315
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,380
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be low density so in the I</font>

316
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:37,440
Triple E the cost choices were made so

317
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:39,360
that you know hopefully a hundred gig

318
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,300
interface interface will be cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

319
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it than 10 x 10 gig interfaces that may</font>

320
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,349
not be initially true in the first

321
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,210
interfaces that we see i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

322
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:51,170
know the pricing for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> alcatel there's</font>

323
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:52,940
unifor interface but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know it's</font>

324
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,099
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cheap interface so it's</font>

325
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,810
basically you're gonna be initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

326
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,910
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really need it and can</font>

327
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,279
afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and you know there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

328
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,769
trade-offs there's operational issues is

329
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,490
it more cost effective for me to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

330
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:09,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten-by-ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flag</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or a 100 gig interface</font>

331
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:11,389
operationally how do I manage that maybe

332
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:14,230
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just look at hardware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> costs</font>

333
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:16,910
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> people look at the big picture</font>

334
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:19,040
so in the near term lag may be more

335
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,079
effective for you but again keep in mind

336
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made this point a lot my early</font>

337
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:24,620
presentations but the higher speed

338
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,589
interfaces are going to make 10 gig

339
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,680
denser and cheaper so if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think</font>

340
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:34,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">about my previous employer force 10 in</font>

341
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,290
2002 we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> two port 10 gig card 2004</font>

342
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:39,170
we had a four port 10 gig card and then

343
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,939
2009a 10 port 10 gig card so you know

344
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,889
the interfaces are getting cheaper and

345
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,690
like the street price<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I think on a</font>

346
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:47,060
10 gate port is there's got to be less

347
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">than a thousand dollars so whereas in</font>

348
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,810
2002 when it first came out it was

349
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:52,540
probably several tens of thousand

350
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,849
dollars so we'll see the same trend in

351
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,740
40 100 gig Ethernet and obviously you

352
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:59,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the density has to improve so</font>

353
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:01,459
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a next generation of</font>

354
00:13:59,149 --> 00:14:04,250
switching and routing here well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

355
00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:06,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">a one port under gigas interface is</font>

356
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,730
pretty awesome I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> any one</font>

357
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,680
considers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonable density</font>

358
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,180
especially when you consider that a lot

359
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,790
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> operators that I've talked to are</font>

360
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,439
actually to deploy a hunter gig lag the

361
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,569
first time around so they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

362
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deploy a hundred gig interface single</font>

363
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,870
on their backbone they're going to lag

364
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,089
at least two together for redundancy

365
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,519
purposes so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a one port</font>

366
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:27,019
under gig interface you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot</font>

367
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">of density I mean you know you quickly</font>

368
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,449
run out of the 14 or 16 slots capacity

369
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,430
so reasonable density I consider for

370
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:36,620
ports to be a reasonable density so

371
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:38,569
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take at least 4 to 500</font>

372
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,120
gigs per slot and that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

373
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:43,069
next generation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Technology and like I</font>

374
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,560
said the cost to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gator decrease as new</font>

375
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:50,089
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes feasible and</font>

376
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:53,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously volume increases so future</font>

377
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:55,959
meetings the I Triple E is has several

378
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,240
regular meetings<font color="#E5E5E5"> interims and plenaries</font>

379
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:00,768
so draft 320<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sponsor ballot is is</font>

380
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,550
the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> ticket item for next time</font>

381
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:04,070
because

382
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,560
that gets the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID I Tripoli state machine</font>

383
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:09,140
into the next state for the standards

384
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,939
approval and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

385
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,189
information if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to attend an i</font>

386
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,870
triple e meeting they're a lot like the

387
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:17,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">nana meetings where people are sitting</font>

388
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:19,240
around kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reading their mail and</font>

389
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,859
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just think there are more beards</font>

390
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,600
theatrically and less people at the bar

391
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:29,000
so it's kind of same thing you can read

392
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,620
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the public documents on this</font>

393
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,420
web page if you're interested all the

394
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,930
presentations and you know all the

395
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,920
charts if you're doubly if you know if

396
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,399
you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that kind of stuff</font>

397
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:43,279
go look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one of the comments I</font>

398
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,560
got back<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the pc my draft is that</font>

399
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,870
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to see the URL</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

400
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,279
actual draft specification well

401
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,589
unfortunately you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to the</font>

402
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,269
meeting to get the password for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

403
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:57,079
draft so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't I can't put that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

404
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:59,230
here but definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> read read up on it</font>

405
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,760
if you're if you're interested and then

406
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:04,310
since we have free standard stuff on the

407
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,380
market now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's time that this</font>

408
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:08,119
gets on your radar so if I were an

409
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,490
operator I think this is what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do</font>

410
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,040
I would look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> network growth and needs</font>

411
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:16,610
in the next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years probably you</font>

412
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I through 2012 maybe and and asked</font>

413
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,910
for road maps from people you know this

414
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:21,860
new technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to affect a</font>

415
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,439
bunch of your system so your optical

416
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,690
gear you're switching routing servers

417
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,570
and if you run a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of servers they</font>

418
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:31,640
were they were really pushing for 40 gig

419
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,980
interfaces as a server interconnect

420
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,899
option so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may see server vendors</font>

421
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,490
starting to offer blade chassis<font color="#CCCCCC"> zor</font>

422
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,660
something like that with the 40 gig

423
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:41,000
interface that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

424
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,640
hook into your network similar and then

425
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,410
also talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your transport providers</font>

426
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">and your IP transit providers and your</font>

427
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:48,890
internet exchanges and figure out what

428
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:51,050
they're going to do in the future and

429
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">what makes sense for you and then others</font>

430
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:54,920
I don't know if you have billing and

431
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,290
provisioning systems they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

432
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:59,599
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have new interfaces and then new</font>

433
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,149
new products and<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like that added</font>

434
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,280
and then really you know figure out

435
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,980
what's missing and ask your vendors for

436
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:09,139
it so will<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work with your optical</font>

437
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:10,309
infrastructure your cabling are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

438
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,040
gonna have to create your cabling

439
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,030
remember the

440
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:17,369
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPO connector for 40 gig short reach</font>

441
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,280
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no 40 kilometer 40 gig</font>

442
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,659
reach right now do you need 40 kilometer

443
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,119
40 gig that's something that you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

444
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about and if you need it start</font>

445
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:28,939
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it do you need you thur net</font>

446
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,290
Oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> a.m. and you need jumbo frames so</font>

447
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,710
these are all kind of things that you

448
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:37,770
can ask your vendors for and then what's

449
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,810
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah if you already if you look</font>

450
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,210
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology that we're going to</font>

451
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,159
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really be you know to really</font>

452
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,110
drive the cost down there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

453
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,150
demand for other interfaces and that's

454
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you know in some of my early talks</font>

455
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,660
you can go look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the archives we have</font>

456
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,550
pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the block diagram and stuff</font>

457
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,370
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the point is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

458
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:59,909
standard that<font color="#CCCCCC"> defines a flexible</font>

459
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:02,310
architecture so there's a allows as

460
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology changes it allows new stuff</font>

461
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,550
to be plugged in really easy without

462
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,470
going back through that multi-year<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

463
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:11,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tripoli process so this is really good</font>

464
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:13,020
so we expect a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> msas to happen</font>

465
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:15,150
as technology develops and becomes more

466
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost-effective so you know yeah we'd</font>

467
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:19,350
love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a serial 100 gig right now</font>

468
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,690
but yeah no one could afford it so it

469
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,429
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense so I think we're</font>

470
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:26,820
going to see serial specifications for

471
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">for for unit 100 gig I think we'll see a</font>

472
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,120
duplex multimode fiber of specification

473
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:36,300
for for short-range interfaces and then

474
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,689
also I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see higher speed</font>

475
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:41,340
signaling for backplane applications and

476
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,990
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of an interesting one</font>

477
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,270
I don't know if anyone's following this

478
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:48,050
but the Tripoli so the the

479
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">energy-efficient ethernet is working on</font>

480
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:51,899
some algorithms that would run in the

481
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,270
switching and routing equipment to

482
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,430
actually reduce the speed if the

483
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,690
interface isn't busy and then to ramp up

484
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,420
the speed if the interface becomes

485
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:02,070
busier so their theory is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

486
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,130
reduces<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power consumption around the</font>

487
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:08,040
world by some extraordinary amount so um

488
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,480
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this may be a possibility of</font>

489
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be incorporated</font>

490
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,880
into a 1400 gig so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

491
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:17,160
useful it is but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're</font>

492
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,100
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at and then you know if you had</font>

493
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:22,050
a crystal ball<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everyone would</font>

494
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,500
agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one's asking for slower</font>

495
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,510
interfaces or

496
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,090
seeing less traffic I mean we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

497
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:31,210
people you know asking us for 10 meg

498
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:33,399
interfaces and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

499
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,900
this is good because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> need for</font>

500
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,110
terabyte<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet has already come up</font>

501
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,610
multiple times both in the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

502
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,530
in the operator community so if there's

503
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,510
already some discussions about you know

504
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:47,260
what's next<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how is Ethernet going to</font>

505
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:48,850
evolve and the I Triple E I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

506
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an interest in the I Triple E other</font>

507
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:52,629
than that I attended<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of meetings</font>

508
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:54,280
but the I Triple E their<font color="#CCCCCC"> theory there</font>

509
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:55,960
for Syria losophy is that they really

510
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to promote Ethernet so they're very</font>

511
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pro ethernet and they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

512
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:02,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ethernet change you know unfortunately</font>

513
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,480
it just changes a lot slower<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe then</font>

514
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we need it I think people could</font>

515
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,300
argue that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 gig is is a little</font>

516
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:12,580
bit late right now but this is just the

517
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:15,070
way things go so I have a lot of

518
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:17,860
interesting references I mean I consider

519
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,600
them interesting behind this slide so

520
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:21,639
the the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Tripoli standards</font>

521
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,230
process you can see exactly you know

522
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">what goals and what milestones have to</font>

523
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,710
be sit in the state machine to get the

524
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,530
next state and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

525
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:32,400
that's the end of the presentation and

526
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:35,700
anyone have any questions or<font color="#CCCCCC"> comments or</font>

527
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,700
interesting thoughts

528
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,300
right
