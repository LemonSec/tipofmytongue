00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,200
there that I must have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been it never</font>

00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,910
occurred to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next up blame is</font>

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,530
sitting right oh he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> moved over there</font>

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,290
scared me for a moment thought we'd lost

him doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> whistles a little bit of</font>

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,980
history I get confused by

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:42,090
so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to present some some work</font>

11

that was done by myself<font color="#CCCCCC"> in jefferson</font>

00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:38,289
we're sort of breaking away from the

behave if if the root zone is is grown

35
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:05,110
in certain ways so it's sort of an

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting time to be a root zone</font>

increased load and increased deployments

of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> casted servers so for this study</font>

57
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:05,480
we were asked to look at five particular

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,640
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> five particular things that that</font>

59
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:09,560
can be affected by changes to the root

60
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,200
zone first of all just simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size</font>

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,850
of the zone itself secondly was

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,410
potential performance impacts ie

63
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:25,430
response latency third was how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

64
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:27,290
it take to start a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nameserver loading</font>

requirements for zone transfers and

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:40,400
finally changes in response size as as

69
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:45,470
we expect larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns messages because of</font>

90
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,090
then some brief descriptions sort of the

91
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,520
simplest zone was

92
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,409
none signs on with mostly ipv4 glue I

93
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,570
say mostly because what we really did

94
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,919
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we kept sort of the card ratio of</font>

95
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:06,240
ipv6 to ipv4 glue there next was again

96
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,880
unsigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> but a zone where we had one</font>

97
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,710
quality record for every a record so as

98
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,840
much ipv6 glue as ipv4 glue the next

99
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,330
three are signs owns we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sign zone</font>

100
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,000
with full epi b6 glue and ten percent of

101
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">tlds having d/s records than fifty</font>

102
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,810
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds having these records and</font>

103
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,510
finally one hundred percent of TLD seven

104
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,610
dias records and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe in all those</font>

105
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:35,159
cases we had we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> two dias records /</font>

106
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,530
TLD so then for each of these types of

107
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,770
content we had different sizes ranging

108
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:45,929
from 1000 to 10 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> tlds in the zone</font>

109
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:47,969
file so finally some results the the

110
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,880
first thing we looked at was memory

111
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:54,449
usage as the zone grows in these ways

112
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,229
how can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect memory usage to to</font>

113
00:05:54,449 --> 00:06:00,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">change on on the name servers we use</font>

114
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:03,479
this utility called<font color="#CCCCCC"> P map to report</font>

115
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:06,479
process sighs and also included shared

116
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:10,560
memory and other sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know minor</font>

117
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:14,880
aspects of the memory usage this graph

118
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,490
shows for all of the sizes of zones and

119
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,560
all of the types of zones how the memory

120
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:23,580
usage increases and as you can see after

121
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know some sort of in the larger</font>

122
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,570
sizes it's it's very proportional it's

123
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,770
very linear now that the lower size is

124
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,070
of course you have some overheads from

125
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:36,030
from other things but this is again this

126
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:39,120
is with<font color="#E5E5E5"> bind here's the situation for</font>

127
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">NSD there there you know if you cycle</font>

128
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,139
back and forth between these<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

129
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:46,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're quite similar one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to note</font>

130
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:49,200
however with<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSD is our server that had</font>

131
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:53,789
32 gigs of memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

132
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:55,320
load the 10 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLD signed zones so</font>

133
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,530
there's some some data points missing

134
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,530
there

135
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:04,180
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty basic conclusions here</font>

136
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:08,020
memory usage is proportional to<font color="#E5E5E5"> his own</font>

137
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:11,560
size if you compared a fully signed

138
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:15,219
fully glued zone to an unsigned or a

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,630
current zone you would use a bite twice

140
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,490
as much memory and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just mentioned</font>

141
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:23,200
NSD needs a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more than more</font>

142
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:30,610
memory than we had to load the largest

00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:36,010

144
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:38,590
latency so here we built some we crafted

145
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:41,140
some pcap files with DNS queries based

146
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,330
on characteristics from our day in the

147
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,280
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the internet data which was</font>

148
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:47,409
taken earlier this year and then those

149
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,020
queries are replayed with<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp replay and</font>

150
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:54,640
in all cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the quarry's were replated</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">itself so how long did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it take between</font>

leaving the boss obviously you know in

00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,650
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases this latency is is totally</font>

161
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,000
negligible because all the delays are

162
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,919
going to be experienced in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wide</font>

00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,870
delay is really nothing nothing to be

165
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:35,110
too concerned about one thing to notice

166
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:39,549
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that the performance does</font>

167
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:44,440
not change at all really as the zone

<font color="#E5E5E5">for the most part it's it's very</font>

175
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,580

with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even slightly lower</font>

177

this is the graph for bind with a

183
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:31,189
for the larger zones is these histograms

drop down significantly these the red

<font color="#E5E5E5">bit hard to see from this graph so I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">second cut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off so it turns out that</font>

194
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:02,180
something like seventy percent of Earth

195
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:06,139
only seventy percent of queries are

196
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:08,420
going answered within four seconds and

197
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:11,500
then of course as the Sun<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets bigger it</font>

198
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:18,979
gets a little bit well it gets worse

199
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:23,209
here's NSD on<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign zones much more</font>

200
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:27,040
consistent doesn't exhibit the same sort

201
00:10:23,209 --> 00:10:31,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">of problems and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also I should note that</font>

202
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,829
here we have a 4.5 million TLD zone I

203
00:10:31,069 --> 00:10:35,420
said before that we couldn't sign a 10

204
00:10:33,829 --> 00:10:37,339
million zone but we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign a</font>

205
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:43,519
zone of this size so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we included</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

206
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:45,670
this in this data and here's the CDF for

207
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,670
that

208
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:55,189
so as I said the bind performance is

209
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:57,410
stable for all sizes of unsigned zones

210
00:10:55,189 --> 00:11:01,879
for the for the sign zones we see some

211
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:04,219
degradation this is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I see</font>

212
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:07,730
is already well aware of and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

213
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,649
they already have a fix in the 9.7

214
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,170
version of mind which is currently in

215
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:14,329
beta testing and I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually some</font>

216
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:18,019
more to explain a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

217
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:19,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">this problem and SD performance is</font>

218
00:11:18,019 --> 00:11:21,589
stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> although we start to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

219
00:11:19,369 --> 00:11:27,019
degradation at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest zone that we</font>

220
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:28,069
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to load so I just want to</font>

221
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:30,110
explain a little bit about the

222
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:33,110
performance problem we saw with bind and

223
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:36,949
how this is sort of such a corner case i

224
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:39,079
guess this problem only occurs when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

225
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:41,389
use n sec to sign your zone it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

226
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,729
occur with insect 3 if you're not

227
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:47,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with the differences between n</font>

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:49,309
sakura and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sec 3 really you would you</font>

229
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">would use n sec 3 if you were trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

230
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,899
sort of hide your zone contents in sec

231
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,999
has a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it makes it easy to</font>

232
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,819
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of walk your zone and with his own</font>

233
00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:59,839
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route it's it's so sort of open</font>

234
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:03,679
anyway that there's no reason to hide

235
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:07,759
anything so in sec will be used to sign

236
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,199
the root zone this problem only occurs

237
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:10,790
with his own like the route where you

238
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:13,819
had where it's likely to have a large

239
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:18,879
number of glue owner names that gets

240
00:12:13,819 --> 00:12:20,779
sorted in between the non glue records

241
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,879
that's kind of a mouthful and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have an</font>

242
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:26,360
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what that looks like on the</font>

243
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide this problem you know only</font>

244
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,429
starts to become significant when we're

245
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:36,139
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> zone size own size of 100,000 or</font>

246
00:12:31,429 --> 00:12:38,029
more and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason no reason</font>

247
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:40,610
really to panic about this because we're

248
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:42,079
sort of quite a ways away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from any time</font>

249
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:48,319
where where this could really be a

250
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:51,258
problem for deployed root servers so

251
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:52,549
this slide shows an example of this is

252
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:57,619
some cut and paste of one of the zones

253
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:59,509
we used in the test here we have NS

254
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:00,490
records for the comms own and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

255
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:06,100
other records

256
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:07,990
and then here starting here<font color="#CCCCCC"> with if you</font>

257
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,709
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the pointer this is where we</font>

258
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:13,209
start to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some some glue records not</font>

259
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,859
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the comms own but but</font>

260
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,640
these glue records and with calm so they

261
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:20,920
get sorted in between calm and whatever

262
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,730
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> after it in this case CIM</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> baston</font>

263
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:26,380
and for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> zone we had something like</font>

264
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,330
10,000 of these types of glue records so

265
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:29,410
I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem in bind was that</font>

266
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,029
there was some kind of linear search

267
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:34,990
here that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not optimized enough</font>

268
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:36,520
and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> most other types of owns</font>

269
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:38,500
wouldn't wouldn't have this kind of

270
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:47,160
characteristic in them so should not be

271
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:50,410
a problem how am i doing on time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

272
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:51,819
I'll speed up some of this the third

273
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,819
task was to measure start in reload

274
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,050
times these graphs are also sort of

275
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,149
boring because lots of straight lines

276
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,859
lots of proportional behavior but I

277
00:13:58,149 --> 00:14:03,160
included<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tables</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just for fun and</font>

278
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,829
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example that when we</font>

279
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,969
start to get to zone sizes where you

280
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:09,910
know it takes a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a</font>

281
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,640
second to load you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see proportional</font>

282
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:15,339
behavior so for for this case a hundred

283
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,920
thousand TLD zone it takes eight seconds

284
00:14:15,339 --> 00:14:20,829
or 1 million zone it takes 87 seconds

285
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,990
and the next size it takes nine hundred

286
00:14:20,829 --> 00:14:24,250
fifty seconds to load and that's

287
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,380
relatively consistent through all these

288
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:33,130
all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> zones sizes and it's it's the</font>

289
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:36,250
same for reload times here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

290
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:39,160
for an SD oh I should also probably

291
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,980
mention that we have some missing data

292
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,810
here because again on our server with 32

293
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:52,290
gigs of<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was not enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a</font>

294
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:54,910
reload for bind here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data for NSD</font>

295
00:14:52,290 --> 00:15:02,740
conclusions everything here is

296
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:04,510
proportional to his own size test for

297
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:08,160
let's look at the zone transfer

298
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:10,870
characteristics particularly bandwidth

299
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,380
this graph is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit complicated</font>

300
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:17,440
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try to explain it on the XX</font>

301
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:23,290
here we have the size of the zone file

302
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:26,110
on disk and on the y-axis is the amount

303
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:29,260
of data sent over the network for<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone</font>

304
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:32,170
transfer as a percentage of the zone

305
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,939
size so the hundred percent line is is

306
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:36,520
right here this would be where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> took</font>

307
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,910
exactly as much bandwidth to to transfer

308
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,640
the zone as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as it exists on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> disk</font>

309
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,380
these four clusters here represent four

310
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:46,420
of those own sizes that we test it

311
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:51,400
starting at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 up all the way up to 1</font>

312
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:56,849
million so these these cases that are

313
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:59,110
below the one hundred percent mark are

314
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:03,220
well the ones that are very far below

315
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our NSD it turns out that NSD will</font>

316
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,670
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> name compression in its zone</font>

317
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:10,270
transfers whereas bind does not i

318
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:12,760
believe so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of pushes bind up a</font>

319
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,949
little little higher here but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

320
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,540
see when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're talking about sign zones</font>

321
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:19,360
which is these these sort of higher

322
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,740
clusters you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of lot more</font>

323
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,560
bandwidth to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do zone transfer than it</font>

324
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:29,590
does say to do an rsync you know to just

325
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:31,239
copy the bytes of the whole file this

326
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:36,730
graph is also relatively straightforward

327
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:39,190
but it shows zone transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> durations how</font>

328
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:42,190
they change as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you introduce latency and</font>

329
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:43,720
packet loss so if you have no latency no

330
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:45,330
packet loss you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is very fast zone</font>

331
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,020
transfers but if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

332
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:53,400
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1% packet loss and a large zone you</font>

333
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:53,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it starts to become significant I</font>

334
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:58,810
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most of this already so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

335
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:01,930
going to skip this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk a little bit</font>

336
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:03,640
about response sizes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP usage so we</font>

337
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:07,829
wanted to look at to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what extent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

338
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:09,879

339
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,129
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a sort of a well-known</font>

340
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem not really a well-known solution</font>

341
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,480
yet but with DNS SEC the messages are

342
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:17,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get bigger and we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

343
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,360
there are some clients that cannot

344
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:21,360
accept these larger messages

345
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,790
this graph shows results of a simulation

346
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,910
we did where the current route stone

347
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:33,389
became signed and we replayed some

348
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:37,780
existing client traces that we had and

349
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:40,890
on these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes of l root we got 0</font>

point three percent of requests being

351
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:48,150
retried as TCP well that's not that's

352
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:51,040
not quite accurate we had these are

353
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:53,350
these are replies that were truncated I

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">either the TC bid was set and we would</font>

355
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,240
expect them to be retried as TCP and

356
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing except</font>

357
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,050
instead of the current zone the the

358
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,909
green line represents what if you had a

359
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:12,460
zone with 1 million TL DS in it and

360
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:19,590
there's an increase again in in rates of

361
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:24,520
truncation there this graph shows the

362
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:25,870
sizes of responses that got truncated it

363
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,100
shows the size<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a if they wouldn't</font>

368
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,770
size was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 512 and then we measured what</font>

370

371
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,600
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not limited to 512 and there's a</font>

372
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:55,240
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Peaks one right here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 650</font>

373
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,740
another one slightly over 700 I forget I

374
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,000
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> now which one of the one of these</font>

375
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,730
is an X domains and the other is

376
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,100
referrals and then sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most that</font>

377
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:10,480
we saw was slightly more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 800 or</font>

378
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:11,800
right around 800 bytes ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this</font>

379
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,420
we kind of concluded that the root

380
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,550
servers can expect to see about an order

381
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,590
of magnitude increase in<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP queries</font>

382
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:20,159
when the route becomes signed and in the

383
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:23,020
case of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> root it would go from say five</font>

384
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:27,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCPS per second to 50 t-series per</font>

385
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:30,220
second increasing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of tlds</font>

386
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:32,280
appears to increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP traffic and we</font>

387
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of theorized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is because</font>

388
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,670
certain names like an SEC record names

389
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,899
get longer and

390
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:42,030
and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of increase the size of</font>

391
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:43,740
responses and then as I said UDP

392
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:46,830
responses that might be truncated with

393
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,800
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the small buffer size what it would</font>

394
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:55,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">be smaller than 825 lights if if they</font>

395
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:56,430
didn't have to be truncated so if you

396
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,139

you this time or things that are out of

for for that please get in touch with us

408
