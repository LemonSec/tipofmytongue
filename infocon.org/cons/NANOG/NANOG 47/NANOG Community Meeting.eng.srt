58
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,040
then I'm 46 the elusive<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

59
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,470
experiment policy finally got agreement

60
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,650
the changes suggested from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the community</font>

61
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:13,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and worked out with with merit and it</font>

62
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:16,560
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be posted on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site it is yeah</font>

63
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,048
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> good so the key things being</font>

64
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,630
that any network experiment

65
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:22,980
participation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is voluntary by nanog</font>

66
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,780
attendees it's not going to be foisted

67
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:30,179
on anybody data will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be shared and was</font>

68
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,950
the other key thing I think those are

69
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,130
the two important ones it was they were

70
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:37,858
like oh yeah yeah yeahs pre-planning and

71
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:39,600
you know actually not showing up day<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

72
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:43,650
meeting and saying hey I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do an</font>

73
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,700
experiment yeah and we don't want more

74
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:50,549
work on under the full list of items its

75
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,440
first short is up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site and</font>

76
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:53,910
includes like what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to</font>

77
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,370
submit so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really wanted to get</font>

78
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,049
some data from all your colleagues in

79
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,790
terms of network behavior and have

80
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:03,989
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to do that would</font>

81
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">be reasonable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the nanog network to</font>

82
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,180
be a an experimental test bet then

83
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:13,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposed it before I believe it's three</font>

84
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,540
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the meeting the annual</font>

85
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,539

90
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:38,008
a community if if we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we and the</font>

91
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:41,969
recipients have been gaining value we

92
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:44,669
need to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we put how we</font>

93
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:49,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be putting more funding into the</font>

94
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:54,650
pot expect to hear more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that if</font>

95
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:57,239
from the SE<font color="#CCCCCC"> downline there is a</font>

96
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,919

99
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,870
the funding elements and that is really

100
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:13,258
<font color="#E5E5E5">as an outreach for educational</font>

101
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:16,740
institutions to get more of the younger

slide of mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists addresses most</font>

119
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,669
important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting right at the</font>

120
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,050
top there are nominations at<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

121
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:12,349
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read off the rest because I</font>

122
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:17,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you all can read Dave</font>

123
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:23,540
I hope I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any slice oh ok I do</font>

124
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,460
sorry um well I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this and</font>

125
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,840
on the plane today because I was going

126
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,930
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> these slides and I decided not</font>

127
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,289
to mostly because I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say a few</font>

128
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">things one is i mean i could give you</font>

129
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,670
guys all the statistics is pretty dull

130
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:40,280
we got 47 talks we accepted eighty

131
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,580
percent of them that's it but what's

132
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,049
really more important is that if you're

133
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,750
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net from the program community</font>

134
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,060
perspective if you're going to submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

135
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,040
talk one of the big problems we have is

136
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,440
people submit really great ideas but

137
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,970
they never give us any slides or even

138
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:00,110
outline slides so we we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard time</font>

139
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:02,270
deciding whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can accept</font>

140
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,420
things and sometimes that goes wrong so

141
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:07,760
if you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to propose a talk or or</font>

142
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,830
you know people who are pros and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tucks</font>

143
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,400
what you really what would really be

144
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,630
helpful to us is if you got slides to us

145
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,940
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to give you any statistics</font>

146
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,940
because as I said it's really built the

147
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:22,040
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to say was um if</font>

148
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:23,540
you know people who would be good for

149
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC because a lot of people are</font>

150
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,950
rotating off the pc i think half roughly

151
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:30,170
half I mean some are timing out some are

152
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,960
not reopen so roughly half so it's going

153
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a big turnover so the composition</font>

154
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,659
of the pc is going to change radically

155
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:42,280
so if you know people who would be good

156
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,650
as just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for the pc or that have</font>

157
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,539
kind of a sort of a vision about what

158
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,099
now it could be or should be and could

159
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,460
be on the pc that would be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful</font>

160
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:55,490
the thing is is that you know it it does

161
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:58,370
take some commitment and you know people

162
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:00,020
should know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but um those</font>

163
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,070
those were the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> things i wanted to</font>

164
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,490
say i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to take up a lot of</font>

165
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:05,990
time but i did want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask well let me</font>

166
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,590
say one other thing too is that we have

167
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:12,020
this process where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get the talks and</font>

168
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:14,270
then we all rate them and then we rate

169
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,370
you know based on the input that we get

170
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:18,289
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally slice and this is</font>

171
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:21,349
where the not having

172
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:25,308
slides thing becomes difficult but we we

173
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:27,589
rate them and so we select them based on

174
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:29,449
what information we have and sometimes

175
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:31,849
what happens is and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has happened</font>

176
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:34,459
this time in<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get in</font>

177
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,649
from we get like slides or updated

178
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:39,289
slides very late and it makes it

179
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult for us to select talks that</font>

180
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:44,029
maybe we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be good so get</font>

181
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:45,560
bigger get your stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> in early and then</font>

182
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,540
the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I wanted to just say</font>

183
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,300
because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to I want everybody to</font>

184
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,610
get to the social<font color="#CCCCCC"> event is you know do</font>

185
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,920
people have questions for the program

186
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:59,449
committee how it operates what it ought

187
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,699
to be doing again in the in the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

188
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:03,290
sentiment that this is your meeting that

189
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:05,300
we should things that we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

190
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:07,849
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things that we could do to</font>

191
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,699
make the meeting better anybody have

192
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:14,180
anything like that go like this if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

193
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:20,630
do or you know go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mics</font>

194
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:23,300
oh by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was looking at you</font>

195
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:25,220
thanks but was looking at Joe's slide

196
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:28,160
about the mailing lists<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't post</font>

197
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,220
most of those myself so you know so you

198
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,130
had said that you had submissions that

199
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,810
weren't complete but look like they were

200
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:37,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be good talks why not move</font>

201
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,589
those to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightning talks oh that's</font>

202
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,630
what we try to do that's you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

203
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:43,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly what we try to do in fact it</font>

204
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:45,139
turned out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a excellent point in</font>

205
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,459
fact what turned out was a lot of the

206
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:49,370
lightning talks would have been nice for

207
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:51,018
general session you know but fortunately

208
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,060
we have the space in lightning talks to

209
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:54,709
accommodate them because the reality is

210
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:58,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some point we have to we have to have</font>

211
00:09:54,709 --> 00:10:00,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone agenda and the lightning talks</font>

212
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:05,630
give us flexibility to kind of do

213
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:10,670
exactly what you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> Louis hey day</font>

214
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:13,490
hey Louie um of the people that

215
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:16,910
submitted the good topics and but then

216
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:19,189
submitted the slides if I were them I

217
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,899
might not want to work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice big set</font>

218
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,939
of slices without knowing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my talk</font>

219
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,819
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get accepted so did you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

220
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:28,420
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least ask them for the outline yeah</font>

221
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,819
we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we do but you know it's</font>

222
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,529
there's varying degree you know you know

223
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">how many talks you've given right so you</font>

224
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:36,339
give the minimum amount of you do the

225
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:38,529
minimum amount of work you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do at</font>

226
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:40,959
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do you know and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

227
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">what people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do and and you know</font>

228
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,859
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm saying is sometimes</font>

229
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:50,350
if you just did a little bit more it

230
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:52,449
would help us out oh no I'm getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

231
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,310
question for men this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a comment or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

232
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:57,040
question this is a comment not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

233
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:59,260
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yes we get topics that are</font>

234
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,000
very very similar and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have an</font>

235
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,880
abstract it's very difficult to figure

236
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">out if we could ask that both parties to</font>

237
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,630
work together and either<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine or one</font>

238
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,940
party to take the lead in the other

239
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,370
party to contribute on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the back end this</font>

240
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,389
is why the slides are really key

241
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:20,560
abstracts are great but they're rather

242
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:24,220
abstract what she said yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i'll</font>

243
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:28,060
just add who are you by the way I'm Todd

244
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:31,930
Underwood I'm a near-future former

245
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:35,050
program committee member um and I think

246
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">for context I'll add this is a standoff</font>

247
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:40,180
right this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a typically it is really</font>

248
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,790
good presenters playing chicken with the

249
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,709
program committee and like we all lose

250
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:46,180
at that but typically people like I

251
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:47,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to do the slides unless I'm</font>

252
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,269
going to get the talk accepted we're

253
00:11:47,589 --> 00:11:52,329
like I haven't going to accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk</font>

254
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:54,070
unless you do the slides so typically if

255
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:57,099
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the program committee says</font>

256
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:59,320
this is a really good talk idea a lot of

257
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are interested in it please do</font>

258
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,339
some slides but we can't commit to

259
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:05,229
accepting it what that means is if you

260
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,880
do the slides unless you're a complete

261
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:08,380
doofus your talk will probably be

262
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,959
accepted and so you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do this</font>

263
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,730
lot so the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing I'll come in</font>

264
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,529
is that frequently people will do slides

265
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,260
that don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any appreciable</font>

266
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,610
narrative at all to them aside from the

267
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">one that's in the person's head which</font>

268
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:22,180
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's not going to be a good</font>

269
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,699
talk it could be a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk but if</font>

270
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,739
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the slides if the narrative</font>

271
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the story isn't in the slides there's</font>

272
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,670
no way somebody who doesn't know you and

273
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:33,189
hasn't seen the talk given can judge the

274
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:34,750
slide so try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some sort of i am</font>

275
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,610
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about this it will be</font>

276
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,260
about this here are six subjects look I

277
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,459
have covered the six subjects there's

278
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,839
five pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

279
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,399
to come off though that in later which

280
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:44,139
because it's hard work and I don't want

281
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,079
to do it after that's fine like leaving

282
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:49,179
specific slides empty but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not fine</font>

283
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,959
to just say I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this</font>

284
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:54,279
please accept my time oh and yet so the

285
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,949
other thing to remember is that one of

286
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:58,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano archives are hugely important</font>

287
00:12:56,949 --> 00:13:01,149
in tons of people spend a lot of time in

288
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,459
the archives and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's great material</font>

289
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:04,899
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and they won't typically even</font>

many people will but most people won't

and so make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your presentation</font>

00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:19,110
tells a story even without you giving

00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,720
yeah so I'm Jolie a glee I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:29,110
those of us were getting off this time

314
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:33,999
for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part have been around for</font>

and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the merit participants were the ones</font>

320
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,220
was created so we have the institutional

321
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:52,629
memory and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the</font>

322
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,029
community you should have that so been

00:14:52,629 --> 00:15:00,339
around from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inception</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the new</font>

324
00:14:55,029 --> 00:15:04,269
charter to the present the PC internal

325
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:07,019
process is fairly ad-hoc we do things on

326
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:12,220
a consensus basis but it's not arbitrary

327
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:14,350
that is we do rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on precedent there's</font>

328
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,230
been demonstrated to be willingness on

329
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:19,540
the part of participants in the PC to

330
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:21,129
alter the division of labor so just

331
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:22,599
because somebody did something in the

332
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:27,399
past doesn't mean they'll do it in the

333
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:29,589
future we're responsive to SC input or

334
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,869
at least we have been but we're not

335
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">beholding to them in theory they can</font>

336
00:15:31,869 --> 00:15:36,429
replace us unlike with the mlc we've

337
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,779
never actually managed to escalate

338
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:40,389
something to the point where it became a

339
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:46,089
crisis in some respects I'm actually

340
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:51,069
disappointed by that but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

341
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:53,829
are the way they are so one of the

342
00:15:51,069 --> 00:15:56,349
things that came out of the new charter

343
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:57,969
and the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the SC works in the way</font>

344
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:01,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program committee works was an</font>

345
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:03,790
increased effort at transparency so this

346
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:07,449
results in minutes from our meetings

347
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,368
which don't discuss the merits of the

348
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:11,469
individual presentations but do discuss

349
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:13,929
the themes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the program</font>

350
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,069

that we've raised with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the steering</font>

those don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get read by too many people</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">set Martin Hannigan but</font>

356

you know they are out there obviously

<font color="#E5E5E5">there are a few points of friction</font>

pc is a relatively well oiled machine

364
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,480
but sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it runs over stuff or</font>

365
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:07,670
breaks things so one of the things that

366
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:11,610
came out of the the new charter process

367
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:15,390
was the practical requirements driven by

368
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:16,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">the community earlier availability of</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cfp is earlier right after the</font>

00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,389
actually altering it right up to the

382
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:54,300
date where we put a stamp on it and

383
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,919
called it good so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually took</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,720
considerable amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort that means</font>

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,880
speeding up all of our processes you

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,630
mean hounding you folks to make sure

387
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,929
that you get your talks in early and it

388
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:10,130
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> reduced flexibility so there are</font>

389
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:13,919
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> trade-offs associated with</font>

getting this process out earlier I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

391
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,530
we've been pretty successful and I don't

00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the quality of the program</font>

has suffered as a result in fact I mean

394
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:28,410
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made very serious efforts to</font>

00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,919
avoid that programming of joint

00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:33,809
activities the program committee oddly

397
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,840
enough thinks of itself as controlling

398
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:38,250
the program and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,300
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work more closely with the</font>

way and we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have significant</font>

412
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:20,970
good luck distribution of ownership of

repeating program elements and

414
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,560
increasing depth of the bench so one of

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">the complaints that when I was early on</font>

421
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,270
because it has multiple people<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font>

everybody loves those the big secret is

434
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,650
is they also allow us to move program

435
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">elements around because they're not</font>

436
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,330
pre-scheduled so that means we get the

437
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:24,120
agenda early out with items on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and we</font>

438
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:28,620
can still tweak it up to the last minute

439
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:31,350
the peering track I think I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new</font>

440
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,610
format I think lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other people do</font>

441
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:35,100
too i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a little bit more</font>

442
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,409
inclusive than it used to be newcomers

443
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,550
Ren was really the champion of this in

444
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:44,040
fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> she paid for it or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Comcast did but</font>

445
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,990
but Ren actually made the newcomers work

446
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,940
the first two times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

447
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:52,320
now it's become an institution so that

448
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:54,300
was a serious wind for this this program

449
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,480
committee and I think the program

450
00:20:54,300 --> 00:21:00,780
quality has gotten better and I don't

451
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:03,240
think that's necessarily to cast doubt

452
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:06,178
on the abilities of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous program</font>

453
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,179
committees but we really tried pretty

454
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:12,900
hard on this and it was a serious

455
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:28,260
element of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were trying to</font>

456
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:31,620
produce so thanks thanks Joe all right

actively participate in the mailing list

Simon is out<font color="#E5E5E5"> in New Zealand so he</font>

the last meeting the major update to the

470
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:23,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">mailing list committee was the</font>

471
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,890
publication of our thread moderation

472
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:29,428
policy this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

473
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,950

474
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:34,410
use and I think we've been fairly

475
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:37,080
successful at it but you can read the

476
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,630
policy at the URL there and if you have

477
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,210
feedback on any of the policies please

478
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:46,170
bring them up on nanog futures futures

479
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:50,190
has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty quiet lately since the</font>

480
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:53,790
last meeting not much has changed we've

481
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:56,240
been very light handed we've relied on

482
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:59,610
thread moderation policy rather than

483
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,320
poking at individual people

484
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:05,590
especially when threats get completely

485
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,720
out of control September numbers were

486
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,780
actually higher i got them just shortly

487
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:15,640
after the slides were put together we're

488
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:19,418
at 10,000 448 subscribers so it's a lot

489
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people on there it's growing the</font>

490
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:26,230
number of posts actually went down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

491
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:27,460
September 651 so the level of post

492
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:29,080
hasn't really changed but the number of

493
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:31,360
subscribers has increased so it's just

494
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:32,649
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all need to keep in</font>

495
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:38,949
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're reaching a fairly large</font>

496
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:40,900
audience when posting we have two seats

forecaster that we at merit need to look

603
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:45,490
at when we're making hotel reservations

we're trying to do but it's very

608
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:57,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult sometimes to anticipate how</font>

at previous surveys and responses and

audit process internally and we're

<font color="#CCCCCC">getting ready at merit for our external</font>

four hundred and fifty five dollars in

637
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:16,389
revenue we had expenses of 270 8585

638
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,840
dollars and seventy cents broken out in

so that was a good deal we were a little

643
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:32,209
worried Philly is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a wonderful place the</font>

it we had a great program but it is one

646
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:39,410
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more expensive cities for us to</font>

648
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:46,340
contract and such so that 10,000 was a

649
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:49,130
good number for us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Union audit</font>

650
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:53,090
internal audit information indicates

651
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:56,660
that when we did a read of nanog 44 in

652
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:59,000
nanna 45 expenses there was a difference

653
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:03,320
in what we reported to all of you in the

654
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:05,450
community slides of 3512 dollars we

655
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,179
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> lost a little bit of revenue in</font>

656
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:11,630
the audit process<font color="#CCCCCC"> in in large part that</font>

657
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:13,430
was due to unpaid registrations one of

658
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,070
the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I try really hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

659
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:18,530
is get financial data out to the SC into

660
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,960
all of you in the community but what

661
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,110
we're doing is counting on those who

662
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:28,190
registered and indicated they would pay

663
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:31,129
by check when they arrived or other

664
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:33,140
types of situations they were going to

665
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:37,370
present but they didn't present and they

666
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:40,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">Otis a registration fee and so forth we</font>

667
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:43,610
carry them as paying when I report the

668
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:46,160
numbers to you but in fact they actually

669
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:49,459
at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year didn't pay so we</font>

670
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:51,560
have to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that encumbered amount back</font>

671
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,740
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the budget</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lines that I had</font>

672
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:58,190
reported to you and so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly</font>

673
00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:01,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">what that difference is in what it means</font>

674
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:04,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the total year in merits budget</font>

675
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:07,370
ends in<font color="#E5E5E5"> June and so for the total period</font>

676
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,500
which would be the fall meeting the

677
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:12,229
winter meeting and the June meeting

678
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,700
there was a positive 47 thousand eight

679
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:18,140
hundred and fifty three dollars and

680
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:23,320
eighty four cents in the account anybody

681
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,320
have questions for I go out sure

682
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:30,300
I would run down<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but i'm lazy so</font>

683
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:33,990
as a community member what does merit

685
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:39,330
does it pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the corporate jet or no</font>

686
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,340
it doesn't do any of those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

687
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:44,490
would love a corporate jet<font color="#CCCCCC"> some time</font>

688
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,770

689
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:48,870
account balance a carry forward balance

Philadelphia with us so it's making it a

765
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:27,609
little bit more tricky to deal with the

766
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:29,859
hotel contract we have a contract<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

768
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,730
those issues that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> working through</font>

769
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,390
so I don't want to publish dates and I

770
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:39,370
don't want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hold us to it but</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">again so that you know we're working</font>

772
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:49,950
quite a bit into the future run yes yes

00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:52,980
it is approved<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have hotel issues but</font>

00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">process I was asked to add a few slides</font>

777
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,370
and make a few comments to all of you

778
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:07,939
about how the following<font color="#E5E5E5"> process works</font>

779
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:13,290
just so that we're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the same page</font>

00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">when we did the evolution / revolution a</font>

781
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:19,200
few years ago it was certainly a

recognized need on the part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

really well but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is a</font>

partnership sometimes there's issues

789
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:42,920
there's the tension<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the financial</font>

790
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:46,050
constraints that we deal with and the

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:49,650
fluidity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the need of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the program</font>

00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:55,380
more flexible so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes there's</font>

794
00:37:52,350 --> 00:38:03,540
challenges one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we at</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Merritt hold completely to or or as our</font>

of you is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter that's sort of</font>

798
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,180
like the the line in the sand if you

799
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:18,569
will it speaks to what all of you want

800
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,220
us to do in us being the steering

middle list committee and Merritt on

803
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:29,010
your behalf and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as you look at the</font>

804
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:32,190
election<font color="#CCCCCC"> process think about the Charter</font>

805
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,960
and ballot changes that are up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

806
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:36,240
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the Charter</font>

807
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,170
which is important to us at merit in

808
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,779
upholding<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transparency or</font>

809
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:45,510
independence of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process is that we</font>

810
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:49,650
at MIT Romney election process on your

811
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:52,560
behalf what I do prior to June it's

812
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,840
about may june timeframe but prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

813
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> june meeting is actually submit a</font>

814
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,960
timeline to the nanog SC chair which

815
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:02,270
says hey Joe

816
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:04,780
I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow this timeline</font>

817
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:08,089
of process to get the elections complete

818
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">per the Charter the Charter mandate</font>

819
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:12,770
certain things happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> at certain times</font>

820
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:16,430
so I take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the responsibility of pushing</font>

821
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:18,080
that to Joe or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SE chair and say you</font>

822
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:21,200
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to bless this we need to</font>

823
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:23,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody on the same page and then</font>

824
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,879
we leave it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> S we do try to gather</font>

825
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:29,629
the same pages what we're going to do

826
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,849
when and by who and we post that other

827
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,280
web page so if you go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the elections</font>

828
00:39:31,849 --> 00:39:38,810
page you'll see all of those dates that

829
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,480
we committed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to back in May and then the</font>

830
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:44,000
SE chair post the information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

831
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,430
elections and so that the election

832
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,300
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it ran just by the SE chair</font>

833
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:53,089
or by merit we solicit a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

834
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:56,210
to participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the committee process</font>

835
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:58,700
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> election</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> process so it's not just</font>

836
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that the SC is driving that's</font>

837
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that merit is driving or the</font>

838
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:07,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">mlc but it really is a partnership on</font>

839
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:10,550
your behalf and that's why Steve will

840
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:14,359
talk about in and he champions the

841
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:16,670
actual charter amendments as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

842
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,190
for voting takes place we have another

843
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:22,550
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of programmers back at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Merritt</font>

844
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:24,320
again using the nanog registration

845
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:28,310
database that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally got in place</font>

846
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:32,270
many meetings ago as the mechanism to

847
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:35,000
validate who's eligible to vote per the

848
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:37,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter so again we put logic into the</font>

849
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,800
database<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says per the Charter these</font>

850
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:42,859
people are eligible to vote and that

851
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,140
produces that the eligible voters page

852
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:48,680
it's all driven by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the database it's not</font>

853
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:51,348
anything anybody arbitrarily puts names

854
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,180
on it's all by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter based on</font>

855
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:56,599
what's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database based on</font>

856
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:58,220
attendance information we agree on when

857
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:59,839
the elections are going to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

858
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:03,129
agree on when the elections are going to

859
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:07,000
close and then what I do is simply

860
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:09,880
announce the results of the election the

861
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,530
challenge has been for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting</font>

862
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,300
which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of a moving target</font>

863
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:22,600
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows nanog officially closed in</font>

864
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:25,000
the past nanog when we prior evolution

865
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,190
time we had a two and a half day meeting

866
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what we always had and we moved</font>

867
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:33,940
to having a three-day meeting all of our

868
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:36,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of folks in the community really</font>

869
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,160
wanted to stretch out the program so we

870
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:43,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">went to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a three-day meeting except for</font>

871
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:45,790
the fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we have a two and a half</font>

872
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,520
day meeting in the fall so the question

873
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:51,040
this year was when do we announce

874
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,770
elections<font color="#E5E5E5"> do he announced elections at</font>

875
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,160
the end of the official nanog program on

876
00:41:53,770 --> 00:42:00,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tuesday or do we announce it at the end</font>

877
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:02,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the joint program with Aaron on</font>

878
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:05,620
Wednesday in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past we did it on</font>

879
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:08,049
Tuesday this year since it really is a

880
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:11,140
joint program on Wednesday and even

881
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:14,740
though we technically Nana do not have

882
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:18,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">raw hotel or contract space because our</font>

883
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:20,500
program ends on Tuesday we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did agree and</font>

884
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:23,040
work together and the election<font color="#CCCCCC"> results</font>

885
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:26,290
will be posted and announced on

886
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,110
Wednesday and so voting will stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

887
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:32,470
an extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit to wednesday morning</font>

888
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:34,450
915 and that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess i</font>

889
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:37,649
should add that's that's how the voting

890
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:40,480
occurs what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do when I announce the</font>

891
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:45,990
election<font color="#CCCCCC"> results in advance we already</font>

892
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:48,520
have scheduled a new SC and existing SC

893
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,950
dinner so we have the benefit of

894
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:53,800
transfer of knowledge from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current</font>

895
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:56,770
se members that are leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting with</font>

896
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,370
the new SC members in the SC meets very

897
00:42:56,770 --> 00:43:01,870
quickly to look at the results of

898
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:04,630
nominations for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the program committee so</font>

899
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:06,970
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can appoint a new chair of the</font>

900
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,790
SC in a point of program committee and

901
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:13,709
then the program committee meets and

902
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:16,589
work works pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

903
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:19,170
to elect a new chair if needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

904
00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:22,109
as you've heard many times tonight it

905
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:24,480
takes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a call for</font>

906
00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:26,910
presentation going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a new program</font>

907
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,589
going quickly and we have to move

908
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:31,348
quickly through the process to make that

909
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:34,190
all work<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there it is really the</font>

910
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:37,290
logistics provider and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> announcer</font>

911
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:40,680
we're really not running the community

912
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:43,500
election it really is something for you

913
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,080
the SE doesn't run it the PC doesn't run

914
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:50,010
it the community Germans the election

915
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:54,540
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the Charter so that's my</font>

916
00:43:50,010 --> 00:44:01,550
pitch vote vote vote anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

917
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:01,550
questions for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Steve</font>

918
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:14,850
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the really fun part of the</font>

919
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:17,009
meeting like reading<font color="#E5E5E5"> no bills in</font>

920
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:19,410
Congress or something like that not as

921
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:21,510
bad as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the health care bill though there</font>

922
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:23,879
are three charter amendments on the

923
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:27,510
ballot this time none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are really</font>

924
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:29,640
thrilling they're all intended to fix

925
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:33,780
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> things or make some things a bit</font>

926
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">more clear first one allows for</font>

927
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,930
concurrent membership by an individual

928
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:39,750
on both the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and program</font>

929
00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:43,290
committees that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says they're</font>

930
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:45,780
nothing more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the logic behind</font>

931
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:50,190
it was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might make the MLC job a</font>

932
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:52,680
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more desirable for people it's a one</font>

933
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,790
of those things that no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> really jumps</font>

934
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,470
out says I want to be in the maintenance

935
00:44:53,790 --> 00:44:58,590
committee of course we'd love it if you

936
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:02,640
did but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if you had to choose</font>

937
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:05,820
you wouldn't have to choose number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

938
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:09,450
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also intended to help a bit with</font>

939
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,920
recruiting but also to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

940
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:13,560
account a longer-term goal we've had for

941
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,930
quite some time and that is to make no

942
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,270
more than just the mailing list in the

943
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:20,069
conference then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this thing</font>

944
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">called the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet now that we can use</font>

945
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:25,980
for communications there's Facebook and

946
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,049
Twitter<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all sorts of other things</font>

947
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,320
people tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists Mike</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> children tell</font>

948
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:33,480
me all about it anyway the goal here is

949
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,040
to expand the duties a bit of the

950
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,480
mailing list committee to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

951
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,359
account those are their forms of

952
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:41,600
electronic communication changing the

953
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">name of course is one thing</font>

954
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:49,109
Communications Committee else<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds</font>

955
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:52,170
cool so that's this one the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is</font>

956
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:55,680
just a simple clarification of text in

957
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:57,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter that's specifically allows</font>

958
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,618
that any member of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nana community</font>

959
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,800
which basically means anybody who can

960
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:03,960
send email can nominate SC candidates

961
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,250
right now the Charter is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> vague on</font>

962
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,200
that and different<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have been</font>

963
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:10,290
interpreting in different ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

964
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,790
want to remove the vagueness and that's

965
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:14,640
really it those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three charter</font>

966
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:15,380
amendments um read them vote however you

967
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:17,480
like on them

968
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:20,769
but he will tell us at the end how they

969
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,769
work out<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

970
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:36,038
cool hi thanks thanks so we're running

971
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:39,640
up against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clock and we have out of</font>

972
00:46:36,039 --> 00:46:41,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the candidates I did see the seven</font>

973
00:46:39,640 --> 00:46:42,670
or registered and I did see most of them

974
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:45,069
in the rooms we're just going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

975
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:46,809
through these alphabetically so Steve's

976
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:50,920
going to have to actually get up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

977
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:52,150
talking again but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how</font>

978
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">many of the folks in the room can give</font>

979
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:56,289
us a couple minutes of statements as to

980
00:46:54,130 --> 00:47:02,380
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should vote for them for the SC</font>

981
00:46:56,289 --> 00:47:06,789
Steve aside from my wonderful work on

982
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:08,710
charter amendments I've been concerned

983
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:10,779
mainly about a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the major</font>

984
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:12,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenges that faced an eigen will</font>

985
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:15,190
always based in on first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course</font>

986
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:17,019
is we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay relevant to the</font>

987
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:18,819
community we have to decide what the

988
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:20,859
community is first of course number to

989
00:47:18,819 --> 00:47:24,249
stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant to and then make sure</font>

990
00:47:20,859 --> 00:47:26,078
through our selections of venues and

991
00:47:24,249 --> 00:47:28,269
especially the program committee and the

992
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,190
communications or<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimus committees</font>

993
00:47:28,269 --> 00:47:32,589
that we are moving in the right

994
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:34,029
directions transparency<font color="#CCCCCC"> is always</font>

995
00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:36,578
important we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

996
00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:39,009

997
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:40,749
everyone else so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that we're</font>

998
00:47:39,009 --> 00:47:45,339
doing the job or for not then you vote
