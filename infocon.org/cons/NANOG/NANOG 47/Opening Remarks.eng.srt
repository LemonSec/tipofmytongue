20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:24,119
and hosting this meeting so done just a

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:27,330
little gift of our appreciation this is

22
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,880
the the traditional host award it was a

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,369
little unique to put this together

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,280
generally it is merit thanking a host

25
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:45,330
and this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana support team at</font>

merit thanking merit we also couldn't

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:51,450
have done this meeting without our

28
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:54,570
co-host Lisa Quimby has done a

29
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:57,270
tremendous amount of work in putting

30
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,910
together the other parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the hosting</font>

31
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,699
responsibility and this is truly a

32
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:05,970
recognition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit to arbor networks</font>

33

for their partnership so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Farnham</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,180
we came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I give the award to myself</font>

51
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:27,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I usually give them thank you</font>

52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:32,639
but anyway so we we are hosting but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

53
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:34,078
also normally do nanog logistics and so

54
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">I just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a few minutes as I</font>

55
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,200
usually do I usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a few minutes</font>

56
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,810
in the fall meeting to talk a little bit

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,638
about merit and what's going on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

58
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,680
a many of you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder why why's</font>

59
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">mirror do this what's what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

60
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,790
connection so just very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly merit</font>

61
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,488
we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> around since nineteen</font>

62
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,470
sixty-six we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing this</font>

63
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,150
networking thing for a while but one of

64
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,579
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did in our early</font>

65
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:03,180
history as we were a research network

66
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:07,310
that dabbled in production is we won

67
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:10,650
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some others the NSFNET</font>

68
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:14,370
contract and in part of that of taking

69
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:16,798
NSFNET and then helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to foster</font>

70
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,108
<font color="#CCCCCC">internetworking was the creation of</font>

71
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,988
nanog so it's really historical

72
00:04:19,108 --> 00:04:24,599
president that we've that we have been

73
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:26,400
the host of nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> honest is the internet</font>

74
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">is involved the industry is involved and</font>

75
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,429
merit is involved we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> still stayed</font>

76
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,469
involved with nanog and we provide the

77
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:38,039
logistics for<font color="#E5E5E5"> nana and it works pretty</font>

78
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,690
well we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> nonprofit we we serve</font>

79
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,990
primarily the research and education

80
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:46,530
community and so in some sense we can be

81
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,320
somewhat of a neutral ground because is

82
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,179
you know many of you aware of not

83
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,490
everybody is really comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

84
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:55,650
and sharing all their secrets with with

85
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,320
their competitors but we create this

86
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,570
neutral ground and we also know a little

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,009
bit about networking so it's a good

88
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,490
combination i think it's worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

89
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:08,940
well over the years so as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we</font>

90
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:11,280
primarily provide networking to the

91
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">education community libraries and so</font>

92
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,250
forth and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> states have similar types</font>

93
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,080
of organizations to do the same thing

94
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,050
we're a hybrid network or mostly

95
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,510
fiber-based where we can't afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

96
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,949
invest in fiber we do circuits and we

97
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,630
provide layer 3 and

98
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:32,410
and additional network services on top

99
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:36,040
of that like many people we've got our

100
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand out waiting for money from the ARRA</font>

101
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,990
grants so with luck we'll fill in a lot

102
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our network with fiber if we're</font>

103
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,380
successful as I said you know like many

104
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you we find out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that networking alone</font>

105
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,060
is not is not exactly what our

106
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,060
membership wants so we provide

107
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,330
additional services up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stack and</font>

108
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll just very quickly finish up this is</font>

109
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,010
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way the network is working today</font>

110
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,560
hoping it's working well for you we've

111
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,080
got an 80 circuit that AT&T is

112
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:10,120
graciously provided to get back to our

113
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,609
headquarters in Ann Arbor and then you

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,880
ride our fiber backbone out to Chicago

115
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:19,330
and off on to other places out in the

116
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">world so I hope you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a great nanog</font>

117

hope you're in gear is a little less

messy than this photo<font color="#E5E5E5"> and thank you for</font>
