1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:15,660
here we go good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone my name</font>

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,890
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Casillas toyama of JP nap and today I</font>

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:21,600
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about an on /</font>

4
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:25,769
availability model of exchange point and

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,830
the JP nap case studies unfortunately Oh

6
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:32,519
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web pages and the title is only</font>

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,070
an described<font color="#E5E5E5"> availability model so maybe</font>

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,129
it is very hard for you to imagine what

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,170
kind of talk I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do but then</font>

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:45,329
today I like to talk about availability

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,399
of exchange point<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and first oh I</font>

12
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:50,370
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly introduce the JP of what</font>

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,140
the JP nap is okay the JP nap is the

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:55,260
largest one of the largest exchange

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:58,440
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan and which is provided</font>

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,980
since 2001 now currently a<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,920
exchange point in Japan we have the 180

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,369
that JP nap tokyo one and JP nap Tokyo

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,119
to and draping up osaka and these three

20
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:14,909
exchange point are not interconnected

21
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,450
between them among them and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I meant</font>

22
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:21,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and they're independent systems and</font>

23
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:26,790
the tokyo and osaka are approximately a

24
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:29,729
400 miles away so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there isn't a</font>

25
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,070
big earthquake in the Tokyo area<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the</font>

26
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:36,630
providers can back up the traffic to the

27
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:39,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">Osaka area okay and also we built on one</font>

28
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,329
more site in Tokyo the Tokyo to the

29
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:46,259
token<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and two tokyo to on 10 miles</font>

30
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">away alberton Oh as you know the traffic</font>

31
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,110
in internet traffic in Japan is

32
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,869
concentrated in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tokyo area so oh we</font>

33
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,560
have to hedge the risk<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh such a or the</font>

34
00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:01,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">terror or power failure so we built</font>

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,219
another site yeah Oh in the Tokyo areas

36
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:07,530
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tokyo to ok and the JP nap carries a</font>

37
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:12,690
lot of traffic our own the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> ria</font>

38
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:13,890
at a peak<font color="#CCCCCC"> 140 s 46 gig and this is the</font>

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,530
whole

40
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh the fourth-largest all over the world</font>

41
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,459
the top three is an o the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amazigh x and</font>

42
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,870
day kicks and links those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

43
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:31,380
big guys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next isn't JP now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

44
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:34,860
so let's go on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> availability model</font>

45
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:38,609
our exchange point so the white

46
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,140
availability 0 because in these days old

47
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,480
as you know the Internet becomes our

48
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:51,600
infrastructure of that over our society

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:54,120
so oh these days the people and AS

50
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,299
application service provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> or content</font>

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,590
provider or requires a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very high level</font>

52
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:05,310
availability stability and or or

53
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:11,040
reliability so availability<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important</font>

54
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:13,830
for also an exchange point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first</font>

55
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,620
I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> propose the very simple</font>

56
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the strict moral of the availability</font>

57
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,519
about an exchange point oh this

58
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,680
configuration and obstruct configuration

59
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,170
is the typical or one because out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,010
there is an exchange point network which

61
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,720
consists of multiple is<font color="#E5E5E5"> red switches or</font>

62
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,179
some kind of switches and linked

63
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:45,720
together so this is Mason<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

64
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,640
switching cloud and ice fees connect

65
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:56,400
their routers to this switching cloud so

66
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,018
this one this connection is in exchange

67
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,060
point switches and the routers

68
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,650
connection<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there is a</font>

69
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:07,049
demarcation point of it when them sweet

70
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:11,910
exchange point network and a bit and oh

71
00:04:07,049 --> 00:04:15,510
I Swiss routers so between here between

72
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,839
this it's responsible for our exchange

73
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:22,740
point so from this perspective I would

74
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,989
like to define the simple availability

75
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,259
model

76
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:31,190
so the definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the exceeded point</font>

77
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:33,849
is available if no packet loss and no

78
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:39,020
link failure in the switching crowd and

79
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:44,150
old port for the customers are after run

80
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:49,639
oh I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define this the normal case</font>

81
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:54,409
isn't available<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's imagine</font>

82
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:57,470
how not available cases and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

83
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:00,130
typical one isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the packet loss or</font>

84
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:04,250
link down and a switching cloud of

85
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:07,550
course I'll exchange point should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

86
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:10,370
regarded<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a big pie for all the</font>

87
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:17,090
customers with enough capacity when that

88
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:18,979
wave so in this crowd oh we have to the

89
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,250
exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> point provider have to maintain</font>

90
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:25,068
no packet loss<font color="#E5E5E5"> and no link</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video such</font>

91
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:28,370
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of state is very important so okay</font>

92
00:05:25,069 --> 00:05:31,360
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there isn't some pocket will also</font>

93
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:37,580
link down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here so this network</font>

94
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:42,800
defined as not available<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and or</font>

95
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:47,030
sometimes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 is fees Oh push their</font>

96
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,479
traffic into a fitting cloud but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

97
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:54,818
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are put too many packets</font>

98
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:58,940
to this line and this one else isn't

99
00:05:54,819 --> 00:06:04,130
responsible for a provider site so this

100
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:09,340
one is not not nuttin defined as an

101
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,340
unavailable<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay only at this side</font>

102
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:19,490
and the second part isn't one<font color="#E5E5E5"> port it's</font>

103
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:24,380
down for a customer this case is defined

104
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:29,450
as an unavailable if the in case that

105
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:33,040
then the port for is PB is down that is

106
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:38,870
not affected to a pier with others

107
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:42,650
button the potentially is Phoebe will

108
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:46,250
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp collection or in the future</font>

109
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:50,960
or some kind of things so only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one pot</font>

110
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,550
is down is also not unavailable so the

111
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,539
exchange point provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font>

112
00:06:52,550 --> 00:07:00,830
maintain all the port is up and running

113
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:03,860
so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is a very I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

114
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> streak simple but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a strict model so</font>

115
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,160
extreme point provided<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should maintain</font>

116
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:11,900
exchange point network itself facing oh

117
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:18,610
no packet loss or no link failure and

118
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:23,840
also all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ports up and running in the</font>

119
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:25,190
next I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in deep</font>

120
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:33,320
enough technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve</font>

121
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:37,370
availability and the first step is using

122
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:41,810
the network itself either are redundant

123
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so not only the switching network</font>

124
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:50,360
but we add the redundant network and

125
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:54,460
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we provide the main port and backup</font>

126
00:07:50,360 --> 00:08:01,610
or to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers all the customers</font>

127
00:07:54,460 --> 00:08:06,859
and inside an network we are using some

128
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:10,220
kind of redundant particles to to to

129
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:14,690
maintain that this network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is available</font>

130
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:18,760
and the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology is an optical</font>

131
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,760
switch for customer port

132
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:25,469
this optical switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> ow chain changes</font>

133
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:28,050
from main port to back up off

134
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:31,500
instantaneously instantaneously means

135
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:35,849
and I'll tens of milliseconds this

136
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:39,179
optical switch always<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching the light</font>

137
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:44,190
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eff switch to to the customer n</font>

138
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:49,349
and if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> light is going down the</font>

139
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:53,730
optical switch soon change the port to

140
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:58,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side and it is done in a tens</font>

141
00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:01,760
of milliseconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this means oh the</font>

142
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:05,280
most routers do not sense link down and

143
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,330
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh that busy positions are not</font>

144
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:15,120
down this feature is very important for

145
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:19,980
the providers I think because if the

146
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:24,020

148
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:31,620
start to recalculate the best route best

149
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:36,479
path and best route again and if after

150
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:40,890
that the recover that this one yet the

151
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:46,290
routers Oh again or recovers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:52,470
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass is the best so if the busy</font>

00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,570
physicians not down such an hour

155
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:02,100

157
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:11,910
exchange point network is<font color="#CCCCCC"> so very stable</font>

158
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:15,540
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and we also use this optical</font>

159
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:20,280
switch when we are doing the maintenance

160
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:23,849
work so when we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain</font>

161
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:26,839
me maintenance work on the switch we can

162
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:32,220
easily backup change we can easily

163
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:35,940
change to the backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> port and the switch</font>

164
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:39,360
we can easily maintain the switch during

165
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,780
the oh the traffic is backing now after

166
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:51,720
the maintenance will recover to that

167
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:55,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">main how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so i would like to use and</font>

168
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,650
the JP naps real data and this

169
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:04,620
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how effective this</font>

170
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:09,689
technology is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok oh this list isn't all</font>

171
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:12,690
our troubles and maintenance works at

172
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:17,270
the Jaypee<font color="#CCCCCC"> neff tokyo one from a june</font>

173
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:24,330
two thousand seven to make 2008 so Oh

174
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:30,060
exactly one year so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 18</font>

175
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:32,850
events during this year and the group

176
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:42,750
and the green one shows that the

177
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:45,480
maintenance work and yellow one chosen a

179
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:53,310
trouble and red one at a human error we

180
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:59,490
made us some times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> made 0</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over this</font>

181
00:11:53,310 --> 00:12:03,660
operation<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so this during this year</font>

182
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:08,720
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 18 events of our troubles and</font>

183
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:13,310
maintenance and miss operations<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

184
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:17,430
next I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this data and</font>

185
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:23,819
how effective<font color="#CCCCCC"> that those in technology</font>

186
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:26,400
is to improve the availability so and

187
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:31,200
the first focusing on the maintenance

188
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:37,770
work Oh usually all the maintenance work

189
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:42,720
is done of 20 for this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> period ok</font>

190
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:44,499
and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had if we did not have a</font>

191
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,679
redundant network

192
00:12:44,499 --> 00:12:53,799
oh I excerpts would not be available

193
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:57,429
during the maintenance window so yeah

194
00:12:53,799 --> 00:13:01,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">assuming this and we I calculated the</font>

195
00:12:57,429 --> 00:13:07,358
total hour of the maintenance<font color="#CCCCCC"> work was</font>

196
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:09,759
26 hours and 34 minutes so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we if we</font>

197
00:13:07,359 --> 00:13:16,299
did not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a redundant network this</font>

198
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:21,849
time are equal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> downtown but then</font>

199
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:24,669
we have a redundant network so Rihanna

200
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:27,579
network and our main and backup port or

201
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:32,769
for all the customers so when we do a

202
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:37,988
maintenance how the customers connection

203
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:42,039
to a main<font color="#E5E5E5"> support to remove and insert</font>

204
00:13:37,989 --> 00:13:47,409
the back up sweetie it may take an 15

205
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:50,679
seconds Oh at-at least so first I'll

206
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:54,249
main to<font color="#E5E5E5"> back up and after the midday ass</font>

207
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:58,959
back up to Maine it will take an hour 30

208
00:13:54,249 --> 00:14:05,379
second I like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> estimated it would be a</font>

209
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:09,189
30 second so during these maintenance

210
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:11,769
work the impact is approximately a

211
00:14:09,189 --> 00:14:15,699
there's a 10 customer and this time in

212
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:21,249
the 20 customers so for each customers

213
00:14:15,699 --> 00:14:24,998
are 30 seconds so we have two other

214
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:28,509
network would be unavailable during the

215
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:34,509
five minutes and this scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in this</font>

216
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:36,129
case 10 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so well if we if</font>

217
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:39,849
the switching network was redundant

218
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:42,639
button there is no optical switches the

219
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:48,849
down time would be 62 minutes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30</font>

220
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:51,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">seconds button as I told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had an</font>

221
00:14:48,849 --> 00:14:57,440
redundant network also a cocktail switch

222
00:14:51,669 --> 00:15:02,390
40 for customers I'm in the for isps

223
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:05,090
so the down time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the optical switches</font>

224
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:10,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">all changes the main port to back up or</font>

225
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:13,430
in a tenth of milk second so for this

226
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:17,330
time approximately mmm at most one

227
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:21,339
second isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> downtime and that this one</font>

228
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:24,920
is approximately at to second so

229
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:30,260
equivalent<font color="#CCCCCC"> summarizes some of these</font>

230
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:35,870
times approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 seconds is the</font>

231
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:39,260
real<font color="#E5E5E5"> down time so how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much that</font>

232
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:42,110
availability differs focusing on this

233
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,080
maintenance work<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh the downtime the</font>

234
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:48,200
first case oh if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had not the</font>

235
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:51,620
redundant network nor optical network

236
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:57,460
the downtime is 26 hours approximately

237
00:15:51,620 --> 00:16:01,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 downtime the ratio is in 0.30</font>

238
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:06,050
percent from the availability side 99.7

239
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:12,050
percent but if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a redundant</font>

240
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:16,040
network at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the case the 16</font>

241
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:20,150
minutes is it would be the downtime but

242
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:22,550
uh oh the current leader JP nap using

243
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:24,709
the redundant network also an optical

244
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:29,719
switches so the down time is

245
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:33,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">approximately 30 15 second per year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

246
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:38,570
the downtime is a 0.0000 47 and

247
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:41,480
availability would be this one so this

248
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,450
their shows that the redundant network

249
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:50,500
and the optical switches are very

250
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:50,500
effective to increase the availability

251
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:59,130
and as I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> the optical switches are</font>

252
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:04,290
always watching that our light from the

253
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:07,380
sweet ethernet switches<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

254
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:14,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to focusing on the human error this</font>

255
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:19,100
case we mistakenly put the power off of

256
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:22,260
the transmission device between here and

257
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:25,708
unfortunately the optical switches

258
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,669
detect the failure and instantaneously

259
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:31,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">will change to the back up porn so the</font>

260
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:38,549
this trouble does not affect our

261
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:41,399
customers o Network but then if we take

262
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:44,070
the best scenario Oh probably it was

263
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:49,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">about in 30 seconds to notice the</font>

264
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:54,870
mistake and recover it oh I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

265
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:58,439

<font color="#E5E5E5">that oh the transmission device so they</font>

267
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:06,500
soon noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're the failure</font>

268
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:10,020
the mistake so it may recover

269
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:13,530
approximately 30 seconds but then

270
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:16,200
actually stolen as I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> the optical</font>

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:24,330
there be an approximately one second

273
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:31,590
much more less than tens of milliseconds

274
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:36,780

approximately a ninety-nine point nine

278
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:51,330
seven six percent and downtime is was in

279
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:54,140
two hour and a seven minute and this

280
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:58,290
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be are too long yeah and and</font>

determine that no customer site is wrong

also we have we had to negotiate with
