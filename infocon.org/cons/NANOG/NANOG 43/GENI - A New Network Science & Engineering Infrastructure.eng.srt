00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,660
hi my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> heidi piche dempsey and</font>

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:12,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is mike patton and we're here to</font>

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,460
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about the genie</font>

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,730
project which is the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">for network innovation this is a new</font>

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,400
project that has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> started by the</font>

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,740
National<font color="#CCCCCC"> Science Foundation and we're</font>

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,380
really interested in getting input in

9
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggestions and hopefully active</font>

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,600
experimentation from operations and

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,050
network engineering folks so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,390
to try and talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

13
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,140
this network and hopefully get you guys

14
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,670
excited about<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:48,300
Mike and I have been building prototype

16
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:51,930
networks for several years probably over

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:54,809
20 years each and so some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you may</font>

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">have met us previously in incarnations</font>

19
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,500
working for isps or peering for some

20
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:06,510
research networks and if not you're

21
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see us again soon so I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,860
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> genie is</font>

23
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,919
and then how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think that researchers</font>

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:17,340
and ordinary users are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> few years whether there's</font>

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,310
any ways that the genie project can

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,869
benefit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog community and the</font>

28
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,659
answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last question of whether</font>

29
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,119

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">already believe the answer is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yes but of</font>

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:34,170
course I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for some</font>

32
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:39,119
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you could do to</font>

33
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:43,409
help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so the genie project gets</font>

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:48,090
started at an NSF workshop that was

35
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:51,240
sponsored in 2005 and at this workshop a

36
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,979
bunch of industry and academic research

37
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,509
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> got together to try and think</font>

38
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,570
about what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet look like</font>

39
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:59,219
in 20 years and what were the likely

40
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,250
changes that were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be needed in</font>

41
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,899
the infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the protocols and</font>

42
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,930
what were the changes that we're going

43
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen just in the user base over</font>

44
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,980
that time period and

45
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,450
of course nobody can really predict what

46
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,179
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like 20 years from now</font>

47
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:20,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can make a pretty good guess here but</font>

48
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,629
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago when</font>

49
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:25,300
Mike and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I started doing this there were</font>

50
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:28,989
no routers I worked on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first team</font>

51
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,170
that deployed hardware from BBN to to

52
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:34,450
build a router so it's it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

53
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">long time and it's it's hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

54
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what how many things can change</font>

55
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,750
over that time period so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

56
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,950
stuff that you take for granted<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

57
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,110
day when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're working on network</font>

58
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,119
engineering suddenly you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

59
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:50,890
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when you you make your time</font>

60
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:53,829
scale longer like that so what happened

61
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">at this workshop was that the folks who</font>

62
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:57,430
were there pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much agreed that</font>

63
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,828
things were going to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely</font>

64
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,900
dramatically because of changes that

65
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:04,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">were coming in optical fiber switching</font>

66
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,010
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ease and the speed with</font>

67
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,920
which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could change the optical</font>

68
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:11,440
substrate changes that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming in</font>

69
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,569
the proliferation of endpoints of the

70
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">networks the idea that there's going to</font>

71
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:19,238
be lots of sensors and sensors could be

72
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:22,720
addressable and you know rather<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a</font>

73
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:24,340
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> core and a lot of end users to a</font>

74
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,680
network they're going to be huge number

75
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:28,269
of possible end users with all sorts of

76
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">different substrates and all different</font>

77
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:33,639
ways of connecting and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

78
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,190
that probably distributed computing was

79
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:37,480
going to be changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot and so the</font>

80
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,519
ways that you could combine different

81
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,709
things and the ways that you could share

82
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,880
resources we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot more</font>

83
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,650
dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more changeable so if</font>

84
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,340
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this many things are</font>

85
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,840
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network then</font>

86
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,430
it's pretty exciting but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

87
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,959
scary if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think about how you're</font>

88
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,910
going to get those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an</font>

89
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:00,340
infrastructure that's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there</font>

90
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:03,700
and deployed and as our last speaker

91
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,590
mentioned you know theoretically we have

92
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,328
pieces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network now well not</font>

93
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,060
theoretically actually that are doing

94
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:11,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">nine nines and it wasn't so many years</font>

95
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

96
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,100
laughing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the idea of the internet</font>

97
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,880
ever being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do 99s availability</font>

98
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:22,310
so now people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done an excellent job</font>

99
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,510
at making it really hard to deploy new

100
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:28,820
stuff radical stuff on to the internet

101
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:31,610
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a place where it's</font>

102
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and where it's</font>

103
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,750
easier to look into the things that you

104
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,890
might break<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually break them and</font>

105
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,600
recover and change protocols and those

106
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:45,590
sorts of things in a research

107
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,830
infrastructure so the statement for what

108
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">genie is trying to do is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build an</font>

109
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,500
infrastructure where we can explore

110
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,719
those radical designs and being a system

111
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,610
engineer we we like to break those

112
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,500
things down into what those words

113
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:04,130
actually mean in terms of requirements

114
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,960
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national facility means it needs</font>

115
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:10,010
to have a wide area footprint it really

116
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be available all over the US it</font>

117
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,750
needs to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the experiments to be</font>

118
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,750
large with the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of geographic</font>

119
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,400
reach but also with really large reach

120
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,030
in terms of the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who can</font>

121
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">participate in an experiment and the</font>

122
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:27,409
number of experiments that can run

123
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:28,609
simultaneously so we're looking at being

124
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,040
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a thousand different</font>

125
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:33,070
experiments simultaneously<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of</font>

126
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,800
those experiments being potentially

127
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:40,370
scalable up to hundreds of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

128
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,600
users / experiment the other thing that

129
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:43,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need to do if you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

130
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,740
that many experiments in an

131
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,360
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that shared is figure out</font>

132
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:51,550
how to make sure they don't all stomp on

133
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,290
each other so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

134
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,690
slicing and virtual computing in a way

135
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,510
that lets people get access to their

136
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,430
resources and maybe mess up their slice

137
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:06,650
of the network but not impact everybody

138
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,300
else so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we build that Network what</font>

139
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,229
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to do with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it well first of</font>

140
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,960
all we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to build it from</font>

141
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:14,630
scratch there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of pieces that are</font>

142
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,359
around already and the genie project

143
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,490
recently did a solicitation asking for

144
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,870
people to propose what things they would

145
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,889
bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what kind of</font>

146
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,259
research they'd like to do

147
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:27,449
and we got quite a few people responding

148
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:30,689
to that and we're expecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

149
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:32,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Awards soon so we're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a</font>

150
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:35,029
thousand experiments in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first year</font>

151
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:38,520
but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have certainly</font>

152
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:42,509
somewhere could go up to 100 and we're

153
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be exploring that and starting</font>

154
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up in people's network tables in</font>

155
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,169
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next six to 12 months so it's very</font>

156
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,508
important for the kind of research that

157
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:53,400
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that people can run</font>

158
00:06:51,509 --> 00:06:56,250
in an infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has real</font>

159
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,870
traffic and really complex routing

160
00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:01,590
that's based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real world coming</font>

161
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:03,389
into our network so that's what that's

162
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kind of exploration that's going to</font>

163
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,009
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on we're also planning to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do this in</font>

164
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,770
an open environment so the source code

165
00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:12,750
that people use will be made<font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

166
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,878
and there are a couple of IP policies so

167
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,620
that industry people can participate as

168
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:21,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">well and make their hardware software</font>

169
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:24,060
applications available to the to the

170
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:28,110
project the final part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's</font>

171
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:32,729
required is like I said we're exploring

172
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,289
the future and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that means that we</font>

173
00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:40,110
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support networks that don't use</font>

174
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:42,270
IP now I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know proposing</font>

175
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,439
that networks don't use IP doesn't mean

176
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,399
I'm standing up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to bring</font>

177
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:49,110
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM so don't spam me but we're</font>

178
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:50,310
trying to let people have the

179
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,339
flexibility to come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

180
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocols some people are interested in</font>

181
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:58,289
doing routing based on content rather

182
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,839
than routing based on connections

183
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,520
between computers some people are

184
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,969
interested in doing routing that's much

185
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,039
more flexible and<font color="#CCCCCC"> response to mobile</font>

186
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:11,009
networks and endpoints moving around

187
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:13,169
better and some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really</font>

188
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:15,839
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the optical research and</font>

189
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,639
making the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network more</font>

190
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,210
easily changeable in response to

191
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,860
changing demands so we're expecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

192
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,349
look into all those things we're

193
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">expecting the genie infrastructure will</font>

194
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:30,959
include storage it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> include new</font>

195
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:32,849
kinds of hardware nodes we can't call

196
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,029
them switches we can't call<font color="#E5E5E5"> them routers</font>

197
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,219
because there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in between</font>

198
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:42,809
and that all of the components on this

199
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:45,420
shared substrate our our pieces that a

200
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:46,979
researcher can download code into so if

201
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:50,069
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to the genie network</font>

202
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:51,570
you're going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually run</font>

203
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,390
your protocol on your piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

204
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and see what happens not just</font>

205
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,569
get a certain bandwidth through the

206
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:02,430
network with a certain number of

207
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:04,380
endpoints and then the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things</font>

208
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,000
under the future infrastructure that we

209
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,230
know our problems but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't really</font>

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a lot of active proposals yet is</font>

211
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:15,810
how to build in security and privacy

212
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:19,350
protection from the beginning so unlike

213
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,199
the way the IP protocol again and

214
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:25,890
developed where most of that stuff was

215
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,709
added on later we want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get it</font>

216
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,360
in there at the beginning and we also

217
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:33,300
want to involve end users in the

218
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,339
research so people who are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

219
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:37,800
able to go to research websites and

220
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,930
download a genie client in order to

221
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,569
participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a project think kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

222
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,910
like study at home only<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe a little</font>

223
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:50,490
bit more interactive and doing little

224
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:54,089
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> network things to participate I'm</font>

225
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:57,330
sorry yeah people in your networks mike

226
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:59,250
says so people who are participating in

227
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> research may well be your customers</font>

228
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:03,500
they may well be your customers

229
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,230
customers and you should start seeing

230
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:10,410
their traffic so how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

231
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,600
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> this obviously you can't build</font>

232
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:17,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to last 20 years in one shot</font>

233
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we're expecting to be prototyping and</font>

234
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,440
building out the test infrastructure

235
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,630
like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the meeting where the idea</font>

236
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,230
came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about three years ago</font>

237
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,270
and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> expecting about three years of</font>

238
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:33,180
building and doing cycles of deployment

239
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,220
and integration so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one we</font>

240
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,819
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start showing up in six to</font>

241
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:41,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">twelve months and then they'll be kind</font>

242
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">of roughly six months iterations after</font>

243
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,839
that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> four new versions</font>

244
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:52,450
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember sitting in these kind of</font>

245
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,459
conferences and and listening to

246
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,840
research proposers and saying well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

247
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,960
know that's nice but who cares I don't

248
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:00,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">have time to worry about that and I'm</font>

249
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,880
sure most of you are probably thinking

250
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,730
the same thing and so what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

251
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,160
make as a point here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you know</font>

252
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,850
sooner<font color="#CCCCCC"> or later you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call us</font>

253
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:16,390
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the night hopefully not</font>

254
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,420
sooner but we're trying to you know

255
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,699
proactively make make so that that is

256
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,110
less likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully give</font>

257
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:27,000
you something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get out of</font>

258
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:30,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the meantime so please do</font>

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,290
feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop my Kermie or send us</font>

260
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,930
email all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contact stuff and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

261
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,910
details for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how this is going to happen</font>

262
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:40,270
are on the genie website and this is

263
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,000
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really brief overview of that as</font>

264
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:45,430
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as how this whole thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is organized</font>

265
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,370
the NSF is the sponsor and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide</font>

266
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:52,599
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> funding which is this is a</font>

267
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:55,270
multi-year project with a budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

268
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">tens of millions the the yearly</font>

269
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,660
allocation of course it being a

270
00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:01,720
government project goes through review

271
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:04,750
every year but it's expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

272
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:07,330
multi-year project and so the NSF

273
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,040
sponsors two different groups one the

274
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,920
network science and engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> Council</font>

275
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,839
who's who are supposed to represent what

276
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,400
network researchers really want and what

277
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:18,610
network engineers really want out of

278
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,290
future infrastructures and then the

279
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,260
genie project office which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where Mike</font>

280
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,699
and I are which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tasked with actually</font>

281
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,140
building the infrastructure doing the

282
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,530
prototypes getting the whole thing

283
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,530
working

284
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:35,279
so how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is going to look</font>

285
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:37,499
over time to an end user so you've

286
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,790
probably figured out by now that that

287
00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:44,639
researchers are really our customers and

288
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:47,248
the way that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> envision researchers</font>

289
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,569
interacting with the genie project like

290
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:50,100
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said they're going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

291
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:52,410
download their own code they're going to

292
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,189
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reserve slices of substrate</font>

293
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,079
slices of processors and slices of

294
00:12:56,189 --> 00:13:01,410
different kinds of infrastructures like

295
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,748
<font color="#CCCCCC">Wireless and so we envision that there's</font>

296
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:07,108
a central clearinghouse that lets that

297
00:13:03,749 --> 00:13:11,699
happen through programmable api's and

298
00:13:07,109 --> 00:13:13,589
that that uses digital authentication

299
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:16,229
and verifications so that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

300
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:18,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">track of who those researchers are who</font>

301
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,649
they want to be able to join their

302
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:24,689
projects and for the upcoming research

303
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:27,149
period what kinds of resources they've

304
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:29,608
asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for and been granted in the</font>

305
00:13:27,149 --> 00:13:32,879
network so at first that's fairly easy

306
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:34,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do because we own the initial parts</font>

307
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,069
of the substrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the infrastructure</font>

308
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:41,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">ourselves and that's what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bluish</font>

309
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:44,069
clouds here are trying to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

310
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:45,899
researchers slice goes through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

311
00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:47,969
so it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fairly easy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

312
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,350
that when we say that somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

313
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:51,169
access to a wireless network at a

314
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,459
certain time that's going to happen

315
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:56,249
module of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are always</font>

316
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:59,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">unsure in a network but we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> expect that</font>

317
00:13:56,249 --> 00:14:00,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">over time some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

318
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,119
industrial partners are going to be

319
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:05,759
donating facilities so those won't be

320
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:07,769
owned by us or controlled by us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font>

321
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">we know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are some similar</font>

322
00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:12,480
projects going on in other countries in

323
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:15,239
Japan there's a project that's very

324
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,769
similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Jeanne and in Europe there</font>

325
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:18,480
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several different projects that are</font>

326
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:20,759
similar to Jeanne and they're all

327
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,119
building research testbed

328
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:26,309
infrastructures and we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

329
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:28,619
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to peer with them for an</font>

330
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:30,868
experimental infrastructure and how we

331
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:35,009
would go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> those kind of</font>

332
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:36,389
agreements and settlements so from a

333
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,699
researchers point of view we want to

334
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:41,640
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it look really simple but from the</font>

335
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:44,490
back end point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of view we're expecting</font>

336
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">sharing houses and and ways of sharing</font>

337
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,960
data between these different

338
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:51,000
organizations so that we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

339
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,880
clouds put in clouds and have the whole

340
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,290
thing change technologies without the

341
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,030
whole infrastructure trying to go down

342
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,530
the previous speaker mentioned something

343
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,530
that we're all familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font>

344
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:06,660
outage windows and and you like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

345
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,480
a planned outage window but once you

346
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,640
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing a network that involves you</font>

347
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:14,640
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 different providers in order to</font>

348
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:16,800
to run an experiment you you quickly

349
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:18,980
find that there isn't really a single

350
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,180
outage window that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about so</font>

351
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:26,430
coordinating gets to be pretty

352
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:31,380
complicated so this is trying to

353
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:33,900
illustrate how the genie network looks

354
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,900
to the researcher end user and how it

355
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">looks to the to the participant on the</font>

356
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:42,060
general internet who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to to opt</font>

357
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the experiment and there are a lot</font>

358
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:48,239
of slides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> show simpler versions of</font>

359
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,920
this on the website but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

360
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,000
show this one to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of get across a</font>

361
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:56,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of ideas the boxes across the</font>

362
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,080
bottom are aggregates so an aggregate is

363
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:04,890
basically a group that<font color="#E5E5E5"> owns a set of</font>

364
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:07,610
resources and manages them so somebody

365
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:12,680
who owns the backbone will provide

366
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:16,640
backbone bandwidth and switches and

367
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,560
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of optical interfaces</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

368
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,900
grant a certain amount of bandwidth to

369
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,469
this researcher who may also download

370
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,810
her code to the to those nodes another

371
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,690
aggregate for this experiment here will

372
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,489
provide some wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a third</font>

373
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:34,500
aggregate will provide some compute

374
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,590
resources out of a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of compute</font>

375
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,780
clusters that will be sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeanne</font>

376
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:41,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so up at the top you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see that the</font>

377
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,370
researcher talks to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearing house</font>

378
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,839
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the yellow boxes that</font>

379
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,420
happen around those three aggregates

380
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,980
happen so basically the yellow boxes

381
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,469
symbolize that there's been an agreement

382
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,110
between the aggregates and

383
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:59,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the genie clearinghouse about how to</font>

384
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,680
how to provide what the researcher needs

385
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,660
now if the researchers experiment is is

386
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,040
really successful over time she's going

387
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,940
to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grow it she's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to want</font>

388
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to change pieces of it and this shows an</font>

389
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:13,830
example of when she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying ah change</font>

390
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,190
my slice and a slice is the what we call

391
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:20,040
the piece that cuts across all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

392
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:21,780
different aggregates and in this case

393
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,310
she's trying to add more resources that

394
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,680
are owned by one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> our commercial</font>

395
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,419
partners and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run their</font>

396
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,830
own clearinghouse and the reason to run

397
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,300
your own clearinghouses basically

398
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:32,220
because you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some policy</font>

399
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:34,800
control over the resources you're

400
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,770
providing so there's a negotiation

401
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,060
between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clearing houses</font>

402
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,620
between the sorry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial</font>

403
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,800
clearing house and the genie clearing

404
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:46,830
house on her behalf and the new

405
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,740
resources in aggregate d are added to

406
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,899
her experiment at the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> anytime</font>

407
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:55,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">during this people who are on the</font>

408
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet connected to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> genie in any way</font>

409
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,430
or tunneled through the internet to get

410
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:02,370
to a genie access point can say they

411
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:05,730
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to join the experiment and so we</font>

412
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:08,489
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also happens through a</font>

413
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,610
clearinghouse although<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in his</font>

414
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:14,100
director way as the researchers path so

415
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,709
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example what one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the projects</font>

416
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:18,600
were working with has proposed is that

417
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,850
there's a website<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to and you can</font>

418
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:23,520
download the genie client the genie

419
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:27,179
client will go and tunnel to the nearest

420
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Genie access point for you and basically</font>

421
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,920
ask the user whether the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to</font>

422
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:33,780
use the genie resource or not so that

423
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">they are informed that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're now part</font>

424
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:40,649
of an experiment and not on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the normal</font>

425
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:43,860
internet so the important thing about

426
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:45,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of this is that unlike a normal</font>

427
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,209
research project where you can pretty

428
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:51,600
much control everything in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> research</font>

429
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:53,370
project the idea is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make different</font>

430
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,990
groups cooperate and to make a more

431
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:57,979
flexible infrastructure where you can

432
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:01,680
change things more quickly without

433
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,780
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole thing be out of control</font>

434
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:08,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">and difficult to debug</font>

435
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:10,090
kind of a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big challenge so</font>

436
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:12,879
what do you do when you work in

437
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:15,250
operations like we do you figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

438
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,680
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the what are the details that</font>

439
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:22,330
you go through to make this to make this

440
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:24,460
happen so again on the website we've got

441
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,189
some detailed operations proposals

442
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:30,060
procedures that are posted and we very

443
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:34,210
much like to get people's comments on on

444
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,649
these views mostly from this audience

445
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,770
especially we'd like to know whether

446
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,270
it's at all realistic to expect that two

447
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:42,129
different organizations that own

448
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:44,740
different aggregate resources would ever

449
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:46,390
talk in the way that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine here now</font>

450
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,980
I know they wouldn't this year but the

451
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,530
question is could they ever over you

452
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:54,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">know the next 12 months or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 12 months</font>

453
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I'm don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worry I'm not</font>

454
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:58,179
going to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

455
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide but I'm just going to talk</font>

456
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:04,270
about a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highlights i think</font>

457
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:08,800
that are interesting so the first thing

458
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:10,389
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens on this slide the drawing</font>

459
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,100
of all the ovals shows the different

460
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,630
aggregates that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are part of this</font>

461
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:19,480
particular experiment that's going on

462
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:21,160
and the aggregate operations on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu</font>

463
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,380
cluster notices that there's a problem

464
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">with their equipment in the cpu cluster</font>

465
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,280
and decides that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to shut down</font>

466
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:30,550
the piece of the experiment that's

467
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,800
running on there<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're a piece of the</font>

468
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:35,889
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so they go ahead and</font>

469
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">do that but they can't just do that they</font>

470
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:41,410
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to tell jeannie</font>

471
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:43,439
operations about it as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that the</font>

472
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,030
other slivers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> running in other</font>

473
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,490
infrastructures know that this piece has

474
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:52,780
disappeared and can do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

475
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:54,610
it if they need to so one of the

476
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:56,320
interesting questions that comes up from

477
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,419
this is what does it really mean to be

478
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">broken in this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an infrastructure</font>

479
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:05,140
because maybe I don't care in in my

480
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,780
aggregate that the the compute cluster

481
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:10,240
has gone down if I'm providing access

482
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,190
across the backbone I probably don't

483
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">care that the the traffic may have</font>

484
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:16,210
dropped some because some of the compute

485
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,970
cluster pieces have disappeared so it

486
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:18,440
might mean nothing

487
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:22,909
to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might think it's not broken</font>

488
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:25,460
at all on the other hand if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps</font>

489
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:28,070
running a processing center that's

490
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:30,590
sharing with the compute cluster the job

491
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,570
of of what's what this experiment is

492
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,039
trying to do then I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> care a</font>

493
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:36,350
lot and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to know in</font>

494
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:39,530
detail exactly what pieces of the

495
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:42,649
experiment are broken and how on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

496
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,210
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand the the experimenter could</font>

497
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,760
possibly be breaking things on purpose

498
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:48,679
right if you're deploying a new protocol

499
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:51,919
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you want to test is</font>

500
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:54,409
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it respond to outages how does</font>

501
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,200
it address out different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

502
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:59,030
disappearing and so in this example that

503
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,950
obviously isn't happening because the

504
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,700
aggregate operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice the problem</font>

505
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:07,190
but in in the general case it could be

506
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,640
that something that's interpreted as an

507
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,860
outage by operations either in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeanne or</font>

508
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,900
in an aggregate isn't really an outage

509
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:18,289
at all but it's something that the

510
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:20,030
experimenter is doing on<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose so you</font>

511
00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:23,059
don't want to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the details of</font>

512
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:25,129
every experiment exposed but you do want

513
00:22:23,059 --> 00:22:27,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to tell the difference</font>

514
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:30,679
between something that's seriously wrong

515
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:33,700
and something that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is</font>

516
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:36,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> squishy enough for trying to write</font>

517
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,280
yeah trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> operations</font>

518
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,830
procedure around the other thing that's

519
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting here is and another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

520
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:47,149
we'd really like your feedback on is how

521
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:50,570
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these communications can be</font>

522
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:53,870
automated back and forth I know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

523
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:56,889
last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was operating in an ISP</font>

524
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,870
environment most all of our information

525
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,990
needed to be kept proprietary and and

526
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:04,219
you couldn't give<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to anyone</font>

527
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,809
directly who you worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in</font>

528
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:08,960
operations for most of the information

529
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:11,450
and we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> just started</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and get</font>

530
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,210
some shared databases you know of kind

531
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:16,159
of sanitized data out there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

532
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,830
hadn't made a whole lot of private

533
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,630
progress and it certainly hadn't become

534
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:22,730
a dynamic thing that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be changed on</font>

535
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,990
a minute-by-minute basis very easily so

536
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:28,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm interested to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find out whether</font>

537
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,460
whether things are better now whether

538
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,709
you think there's any hole

539
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:34,200
of that ever happening and what would

540
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:37,130
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be true about any kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of shared</font>

541
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,870
database or other shared you know

542
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:43,610
infrastructure in order for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

543
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,610
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of data out there</font>

544
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:53,010
so now to the most important slide what

545
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:56,699
what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genie do for operators maybe</font>

546
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:58,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing I hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not please come up in an</font>

547
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,049
object if you think the answer is

548
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">nothing but one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we're</font>

549
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:05,039
obviously going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on because</font>

550
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,520
we have to connect to real traffic and

551
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:10,289
real networks is how to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

552
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:12,950
exchanges particularly between networks

553
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:15,840
that don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak IP and networks that do</font>

554
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,549
but also how to do exchanges from

555
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,980
different kinds of aggregates who might

556
00:24:17,549 --> 00:24:22,168
all be speaking the same protocol but

557
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:25,490
have a different goal than just

558
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:30,090
connectivity or just a delay measurement

559
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:32,010
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the technologies for that</font>

560
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:33,689
kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's also hardware</font>

561
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,879
development that's going on so some of

562
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:38,460
those things that aren't routers and

563
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,649
things that aren't switches will be

564
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,120
showing up in the genie network and if

565
00:24:40,649 --> 00:24:45,928
you're interested in ways that those

566
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,600
could be used for processing exchange

567
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:50,520
information that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be another way</font>

568
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:54,779
that the genie project might be

569
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:56,789
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you a second way is is</font>

570
00:24:54,779 --> 00:24:59,070
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was mentioning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the previous</font>

571
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:01,289
slide how operations and management can

572
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,168
span organizations what kind of security

573
00:25:01,289 --> 00:25:07,110
and what kind of privacy controls do we

574
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:10,110
need and what kind of technology do we

575
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:14,490
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it easy for for that to</font>

576
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:17,490
happen another suggestion because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genie</font>

577
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,890
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an experimental infrastructure we</font>

578
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:23,460
make slices of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the infrastructure</font>

579
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">available for experiments not only for</font>

580
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,870
people from academia but also for

581
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:32,700
industry so if you have a need for

582
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:35,850
testing some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a backup recovery</font>

583
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:38,220
or disaster recovery situation where you

584
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,899
need large amounts of bandwidth you want

585
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,250
to try putting your data on an

586
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:47,040
structure that doesn't belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

587
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:48,840
you and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works you I know from</font>

588
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,720
doing these myself that it's hard to

589
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,610
sell management on going off and buying

590
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,100
some resources just for the purposes of

591
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:59,219
testing out a disaster recovery scenario

592
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:02,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">whereas with a network like Jeanne a you</font>

593
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,500
don't have to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and be the</font>

594
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,940
resources can be there for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,860
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to test and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then go away so</font>

596
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:11,610
it's not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term investment with a</font>

597
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,719
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of capital tied up in it so maybe</font>

598
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:14,969
there are things there that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

599
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful for you for the genie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network it</font>

600
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,470
would be very useful because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would</font>

601
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,440
provide a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

602
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:28,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the that would make the network</font>

603
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:29,910
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistic another example obviously</font>

604
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:32,430
is how to provide services<font color="#E5E5E5"> across</font>

605
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,830
providers so the name of the game in

606
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:37,170
operations and integration is always

607
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,429
defining your demarcation and the piece

608
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,800
of the network that you're responsible

609
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">for but the name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the game from the</font>

610
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,450
end users point of view is always the

611
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,400
application has to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-to-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

612
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:50,640
so those comments about my internet is

613
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,820
broken you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know can mean something</font>

614
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:59,100
simple like my application won't boot or

615
00:26:53,820 --> 00:27:01,230
I'm talking to the mouse and you know in

616
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,120
a network like Jeanne we're expecting to

617
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,250
actually try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make an experiment</font>

618
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:10,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is an example of an inter provider</font>

619
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:12,930
service work and be delivered that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

620
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,360
mentioned before at the beginning that

621
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:19,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to involve real end users so</font>

622
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,389
if you have ideas about how we could do

623
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:24,570
end user services or tools we could put

624
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,400
on end-user machines or clients that

625
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:29,220
would be interesting to run on end-user

626
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,830
machines we probably have a pool of

627
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,840
Jeannie end users particularly when we

628
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:37,240
start having normal people opting into

629
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:41,059
the network normal

630
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:45,500
and we might have a way to deploy those

631
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:49,250
kind of ideas and<font color="#E5E5E5"> last but not least the</font>

632
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:51,169
genie network is going to have slices

633
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:53,090
that are specifically there for testing

634
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,909
operations and testing operator tools

635
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,439
and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want a different kind of</font>

636
00:27:55,909 --> 00:27:59,600
environment to test a tool that you've

637
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,780
written or if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

638
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">different kind of data set on on the</font>

639
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,799
tool that you think is already working

640
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:11,360
the genie network is it is a good place

641
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,830
to try that out so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the things</font>

642
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,490
we could think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can think of</font>

643
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:20,658
more please tell us what we'd like you

644
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:22,640
to do for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the if you if you walk away</font>

645
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:24,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and only do one thing I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be signing up for the working</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">group that does operations on genie and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one listed here all the</font>

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:39,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> called omis for short</font>

651
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,169
it actually has integration in its name

652
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:45,740
to even though this slide doesn't say

653
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:49,070
integration and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one of the problems</font>

654
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:53,210
that we really have because the the

655
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:55,879
whole idea started in in academia is not

656
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,010
enough people participating from

657
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:00,049
operations and emphasizing how you need

658
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:03,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to design operations in from the start</font>

659
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:05,570
and taking some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the challenges that</font>

660
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,280
you guys see every day in operating

661
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:10,280
networks and trying to come up with

662
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:11,928
solutions for them and we'd really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

663
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,770
to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and get more active</font>

664
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:17,960
participation on the mailing list yeah

665
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:20,780
it's a it's a it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> low-traffic mailing</font>

lurk or who just make comments and never

00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:36,260
show up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will help us even</font>

672
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:38,679
if you participate at a low level and if

673
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will give you access</font>

when you want to complain about us in

00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:47,270
the

676
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:49,520
love the night the the other working

677
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,080
groups that we have our substrate

678
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,940
oriented so if you have a particular

679
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,990
technology that you're interested in

680

wireless distributed computing optical

681
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,970
substrate mailing list is would love to

682
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:04,790
have your input the control framework is

683
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:07,400
the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the working group</font>

684
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:10,220
that thinks about what's the minimum set

685
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,620
of software and api's that you would

686
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:17,030
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were building one</font>

687
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,530
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genie nodes or a piece of</font>

688
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,420
Jeannie infrastructure what's the

689
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:23,060
smallest easiest thing that we can

690
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:24,710
require people to do in order to do

691
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:27,159
those transactions I was talking about

692
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">which have to do with recognizing</font>

693
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,940
experiment and giving access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

694
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:34,430
experiment for the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to the</font>

695
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,830
right resources and doing the slicing

696
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:39,170
and isolation in such a way that that

697
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:43,720
experiment can go on without impacting

698
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:47,110
other experiments if it if it misbehaves

699
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,430
the experiment workflow working group is

700
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,050
basically about writing tools that make

701
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,880
it easier for researchers to do

702
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">experiments so there's plenty of</font>

703
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">research for people there already but if</font>

704
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:59,030
you have ideas for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kinds of</font>

705
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,520
experiment tools you'd like to see

706
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:03,620
that's a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and user</font>

707
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:06,680
opt-in is the final one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> tries</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

708
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,860
figure out motivations and software and

709
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:12,290
structures that would help to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genie</font>

710
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,060
interesting to regular internet users so

711
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:18,470
that we get a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them involved in</font>

712
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:20,360
our testing so I really hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

713
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:24,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">would participate in these we also do</font>

714
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:27,409
meet in person every few months the next

715
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be this fall and</font>

716
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:33,680
information about those meetings is on

717
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:36,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website as well so that concludes</font>

718
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:41,380
the brief summary if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are any</font>

719
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:41,379
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> please step up</font>

720
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:56,570
Brian Dixon couple of quick questions in

721
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:59,510
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of geographic / political scope is</font>

722
00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:04,010
it limited to participation by us

723
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:05,750
entities so there's two different sides

724
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:11,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that question one is will you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

725
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:15,080
funded by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSF the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NSF does actually</font>

726
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:17,660
allow funding of partnerships that

727
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:19,310
involve people outside the US of course

728
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,550
it's a harder case to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it is</font>

729
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:24,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible but as far as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> participation</font>

730
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:28,129
there are a hundred percent in favor of

731
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and they've been actively planning</font>

732
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:33,890
to like I mentioned these research

733
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,750
networks in Japan and Europe people from

734
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:37,190
the NSF themselves as well as Jeanne

735
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,780
people have been going there trying to

736
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:41,360
work out how those connections will

737
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:43,520
happen so participation definitely in

738
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,110
funding little harder how about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada</font>

739
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:50,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oh Canada yes we've been this re Canada</font>

740
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,790
we've actually been up to Canada to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

741
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,140
to some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the research programs up</font>

742
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,840
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I should have mentioned it I'm</font>

743
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,090
sorry in particular the the green

744
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,399
networking project that that's pretty

745
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,709
active about their about data centers

746
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,550
and and how to make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a zero</font>

747
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:10,670
carbon impact but yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely Canada</font>

748
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:17,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">and Mexico although none of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us have been</font>

749
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:21,170
to Mexico yet another question about

750
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,360
what about element interoperability

751
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:25,160
stuff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there going to be is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

752
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:27,530
school periscope doing testing on that

753
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,810
publishing results I think that's

754
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that could be of interest as</font>

755
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:35,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">well yes definitely we expect actually</font>

756
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,159
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first couple of years that</font>

757
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,380
different people are going to be

758
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,800
developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> different elements that will</font>

759
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:44,180
be in competition and that testing

760
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,330
between those elements and also to

761
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:50,820
outside exchanges will be

762
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:52,529
probably a pretty hot topic but it takes

763
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:55,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">a while for the hardware pieces to get</font>

764
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:59,970
developed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's probably why two</font>

765
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:03,769
years and is there going to be any in

<font color="#E5E5E5">genie work being done in terms of</font>

analysis measurement tools that kind of

768
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,679
stuff or are they strictly supporting

00:34:21,089 --> 00:34:26,449
that I mentioned is is definitely

776
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,530
focused on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we have a</font>

777
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:30,060
architecture for a genie measurement

different data / control plane through

00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:38,399
the network that's there specifically to

781
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:40,770
collect more detailed measurements but

782
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,348
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of proposals</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet for</font>

784
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:51,020
we're actively interested in soliciting

785
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,020
for that kind of thing but thanks

00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:03,640
sandy Murphy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sparta I have two questions</font>

787
00:35:01,589 --> 00:35:07,599
previous gentleman asked three so I

788
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:12,400
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm allowed there doesn't will be</font>

789
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:15,640
competition so will you have production

790
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">level routers as first level resources</font>

791
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:22,230
in the network like people could

792
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:27,069
allocate or those<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their experiments</font>

793
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:28,390
yes we will and maybe I'll let Mike

794
00:35:27,069 --> 00:35:31,900
answer that question because it's a

795
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:34,720
little painful because they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

796
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,789
everywhere and and the definition of

797
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,910
production level is hard so do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

798
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:44,829
to try and take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cut at it well it the</font>

799
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:47,410
question of what will we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in the</font>

800
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:49,630
network is actually a very heart button

801
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,720
no matter which thing you're asking

802
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:53,619
about because of the 20 year lifespan

803
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,089
what we're going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the network</font>

804
00:35:53,619 --> 00:36:01,569
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next 10 years is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not what we're</font>

806

plans that we're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about we have</font>

807
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:10,960
you know places where we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

808
00:36:08,549 --> 00:36:16,059
standard off-the-shelf type routers

809
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:18,670
because we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like existing</font>

810
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:20,880
running IP networks and there are many

811
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:24,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">other places that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

812
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,900
something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we we have the</font>

813
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:30,910
demand for having the slice of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bowl the</font>

814
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,369
the slicer ball and programmable

815
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:35,470
capabilities which commercial

816
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:37,660
off-the-shelf routers don't have if they

817
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:39,220
had it you could buy them they don't

818
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">have it so we would have to do something</font>

819
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:45,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">more elaborate and it's a complex</font>

820
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,049
balancing act of where where do we want

821
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:51,190
some components and where do we want

822
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:52,509
others for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example I an IXP where we you</font>

823
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,460
know have one tail circuit that comes

into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ixp to exchange with all the</font>

825
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,920
other ISPs out there since they're not

826
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be speaking any of the strange</font>

protocols that are inside genie that

00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,250
would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a could be just a</font>

00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:07,869
regular commercial router but inside

probably

833
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:15,800
not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bud but certainly if you had a</font>

834
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:17,390
more interest in you know more of those

835
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,670
things being around it would be good to

836
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,379
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that I was just wondering</font>

837
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,820
about the possibility you were talking

838
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,960
about different routing protocols and

839
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:28,370
combining yeah routing protocols and old

840
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,410
routing protocols and seeing how they

841
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:33,740
interact<font color="#CCCCCC"> or doing a faithful one to one</font>

842
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:37,220
network simulation or an ISP or whatever

843
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:40,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah I have this really strange</font>

844
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:43,459
diagram that I made up<font color="#E5E5E5"> once that shows</font>

845
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:47,270
many basically when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start thinking</font>

846
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:52,250
about the slicing capability you realize

847
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:55,550
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> genie could be that each slice is a</font>

848
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,750
national<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and they can appear with</font>

849
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,780
one another and they're going to pier

850
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:02,810
with other things and the actual picture

851
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:05,890
gets to be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very messy but we're</font>

852
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:08,120
weird as operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> people knowing how</font>

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the world operates their</font>

855
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:16,669
all that mess is completely inside genie

856
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:21,080
and you know we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one bgp session</font>

857
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,670
with someone else and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

858
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:27,710
care about what the details are inside

859

genie my second question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of</font>

Federation of sites all over the place

00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,380
including international which is scary

863
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:41,899
making a rough analogy to independent

869
00:38:54,410 --> 00:39:05,029
sites and I was thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about Purdue</font>

experimenter experiment is running on

00:39:13,669 --> 00:39:22,429
access to the network to do something

00:39:18,199 --> 00:39:26,299
entertaining to the Purdue experiment

876
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:29,509
from the IU campus how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you going if</font>

877
00:39:26,299 --> 00:39:35,929
you if you come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with a way to prevent</font>

878
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:39,559
local physical access to a device to

879
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:41,659
keep that access from allowing you to

880
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:45,650
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes to something that is</font>

881
00:39:41,659 --> 00:39:49,789
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> locally that might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a benefit</font>

882
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:51,529
to the networking world but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

883
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:55,429
ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how to do that that would be</font>

884
00:39:51,529 --> 00:39:58,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">entertaining to hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about I haven't</font>

885
00:39:55,429 --> 00:40:01,219
heard anybody proposed yet any idea of

886
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,359
how to I mean basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds like</font>

887
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:06,650
sort of you're saying how would you

888
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:08,689
verify that a change that happen locally

889
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:13,640
say through a terminal interface

890
00:40:08,689 --> 00:40:15,739
directly was really authorized so beyond

891
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,390
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know assuming</font>

892
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:20,089
that the person had the certificates on

893
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:22,640
all of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen any proposals</font>

894
00:40:20,089 --> 00:40:25,609
for that and in fact you're identifying

895
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,939
one of the areas where<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeanie most needs</font>

896
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:32,058
input besides operations is insecurity

897
00:40:28,939 --> 00:40:33,799
there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> security architecture but we</font>

898
00:40:32,059 --> 00:40:37,929
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really had a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

899
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:40,909
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really trying hard to push</font>

900
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:43,640
beyond what's already out there and

901
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:45,559
deployed for technologies or security so

902
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,449
so you essentially have a whole

903
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:49,640
Federation of people who have root

904
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:51,769
access right so you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

905
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,960
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it without a clever idea for</font>

906
00:40:51,769 --> 00:40:55,419
controlling them

907
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:57,130
so you kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to run with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

908
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,830
assumption that everybody is trusted

909
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,480
which which obviously doesn't work so no

910
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,980
it's more like we have to find the

911
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,200
people who are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with a</font>

912
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,540
clever idea and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in and and</font>

913
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,689
funded suppose there's an impossibility

914
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,859
proof yeah that way well that would be

915
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">good to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so we don't look at the</font>

916
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:18,940
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there either way would be</font>

917
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:21,070
fantastic do they have more input thank

918
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,560
you all very much and please feel free

919
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:26,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stop us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here for the</font>

920
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:26,670
duration of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> conference</font>
