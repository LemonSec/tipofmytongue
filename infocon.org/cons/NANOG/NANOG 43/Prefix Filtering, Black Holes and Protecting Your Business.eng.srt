refreshing of the new filter and

83
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,730
technologies because a lot of them to

84

87
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:09,100
policy tools available to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

88
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,769
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get that knowledge out to the</font>

89
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,470
community so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this one as kind of</font>

90
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,720
like this is the context one and the

91
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea behind all this is setting up as an</font>

92
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">nra</font>

93
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,039
is like a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could take</font>

94
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:24,199
somebody on your not team and if you say

95
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,729
watch this tutorial watch this tutorial

96
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:27,800
watch this tutorial watch this tutorial

97
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,870
so you have this kind of tutorials

98
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,400
because that's one of the functions we

99
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,740
do you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whose idea was</font>

100
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:36,469
it not I loved it that all these are

101
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,360
taped right and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use these tapes</font>

102
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:41,469
to to bring more included the community

103
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,090
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of our goal with it here</font>

104
00:04:41,469 --> 00:04:46,759
why we and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of get out line</font>

105
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,469
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through we're not</font>

106
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,610
diving into any router configs or

107
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:51,800
anything with this session remember this

108
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,289
one is just the context overview the

109
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,759
threat why we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this right</font>

110
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:58,400
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about why we're</font>

111
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,740
doing this topic again what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> threaten</font>

112
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,330
problem is no you network have your own

113
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,069
prefix database and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

114
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,948
our big emphasis of the first thing of

115
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:08,389
you know have your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> ir and we'll talk</font>

116
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:10,159
about getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that some of the</font>

117
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:11,599
principles of it some of the naval

118
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:12,710
capabilities while we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

119
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:15,349
you know what do you do when you get

120
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,719
hijacked you know you know and what

121
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:19,789
happened with in the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font>

122
00:05:17,719 --> 00:05:24,830
trigger this with the YouTube Pakistan

123

poked around for it I'll probably find a

146
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,659
VOD of the tutorial somewhere they do a

147
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,729
lot of hands-on work there so why are we

148
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:25,639
doing this again<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pakistan youtube all</font>

149
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,498
right the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> today after all right</font>

150
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,759
and it's had a different impact and

151
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:30,590
we'll talk about the different impact

152
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,439
that's had to the industry because this

153
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:36,438
was something where you know you know

154
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it impacted you know people started</font>

155
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:40,430
scratching head saying what should we do

156
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:42,318
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this because you know we've given</font>

157
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:43,789
all this training yet these incidents

158
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,129
that happened in this case this is a

159
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:48,560
very publicly visible incident to happen

160
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:51,439
because lots of people go to youtube for

161
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing things well what could what if it</font>

162
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,800
happened to a different property all

163
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,919
right what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was malicious</font>

164
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,319
this was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> accident</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right so it wasn't</font>

165
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,900
like you know Pakistan government trying

166
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,370
to black hole on an entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it</font>

167
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,469
was their only trying to block call it

168
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,080
within the country it was an<font color="#CCCCCC"> accident</font>

169
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:11,569
all right and it was a preventable

170
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,490
accident if they had the victim<font color="#CCCCCC"> policies</font>

171
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought through right but they didn't</font>

172
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,569
and we have this collateral damage on

173
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:21,139
the net so this is collateral damage

174
00:07:17,569 --> 00:07:24,080
what happens if it comes intentional um

175
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:28,879
Dave you guys have anything to add so

176
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,520
far in context<font color="#E5E5E5"> why we're here it's not</font>

177
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a single failure on the led to the</font>

178
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,318
accident it was that it was a failure on

179
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,629
both the part of Pakistan telecom who

180
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,219
let it let a bad route leak and then it

181
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:41,810
was the failure on the part of every

182
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:45,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">single one of their upstream to carried</font>

183
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,659

the the Internet in general a bit more

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:57,370
resistant to to accidental accidental

187
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,370
hijacks let alone more malicious ones

188
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,750
you had a thought and feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come</font>

191
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">more precise it was a failure of the</font>

00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:16,909
actual carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pakistan telecom it was a</font>

failure in filtering by its<font color="#E5E5E5"> up streams</font>

194
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:25,069
and it was a failure in the peelings @ @

197
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:33,320
and we'll get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old view of those</font>

problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then in future sessions</font>

199
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,620
will get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what tools</font>

200
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,659
actually configure on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

201
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,039

tools well we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be I think the</font>

204
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,160
key thing we're going to be driving here

205
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,270
is how do I prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that and the</font>

206
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,339
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're seeing out there that</font>

207
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,620
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prepare for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it for the whole</font>

208
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:55,620
industry to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward is you know</font>

209
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,990
having your own information collected in

210
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:00,090
one central location on a database<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

211
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,800
can be used by multiple parties and

212
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:04,460
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to eventually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to the</font>

rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get to that</font>

214
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> purchase drive simple</font>

215
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,650
recommendations you know start simple

216
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,750
and start working<font color="#E5E5E5"> out when I looked</font>

217
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,490
through what we were doing before like

218
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,920
two thousand one to two thousand three

219
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:23,100
the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> wave we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking in detail</font>

220
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,829
about these this work is we were in the

221
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:28,110
weeds really quick and one thought we

222
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:30,540
had was maybe because we dived into the

223
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeds really quick get into all this are</font>

224
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:36,270
you know the RPO so<font color="#E5E5E5"> language sets and</font>

225
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,310
you know that a lot of small networks a

226
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,400
lot of even large networks to go like

227
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,020
wow this is too hard you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

228
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,520
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work I don't know if I when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

229
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,220
can be able to convince my management to

230
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:49,290
do it so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is we're going to</font>

231
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,880
start simple collect all the wisdoms we

232
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,290
got make sure people understand the

233
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,090
consequences of it and then kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

234
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,699
drive forward with best common practices

235
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,380
one of the actions and work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

236
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,880
there's anybody here it is interest i'll

237
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,570
bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up again as we're starting up a</font>

238
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet draft so you know get</font>

239
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,130
information RFC out and maybe we can get

240
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:11,189
a qualified as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp status of how to do</font>

241
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,780
the filter and policies so that's one

242
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,660
effort starting up because sometimes

243
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,100
your bosses they need a document they

244
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,020
say why should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says well</font>

245
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,020
there's a best common practice we have

246
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow here's the document and then</font>

247
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:25,949
your management say okay whatever you

248
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,050
say whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just say that a</font>

249
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:30,210
document you mean it you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

250
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,060
of what does a community need to get the

251
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:37,860
stuff justified so that will be one of

252
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:41,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">the things we get going so business</font>

253
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,970
impact there's a perceived threat off

254
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:47,640
their of you know bad route information

255
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,990
leaking out all right it's happened from

256
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,350
it does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has had</font>

257
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,910
and will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> again it happens for</font>

258
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:56,459
mistakes that happens from policy

259
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:58,949
failures there are bugs there's also

260
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:00,119
intentional<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right and the</font>

261
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,430
attentional you don't hear a lot about

262
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,170
and that's plan because the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

263
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,140
usually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an intentional don't want</font>

265
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:14,180
the ones who perpetrate are the criminal

side of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet industry the</font>

267
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,520
intruders are understanding when you

268
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:20,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what privileged access the routers</font>

269
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:22,370
are great routers are bought and sold on

270
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,660
the net today in the criminal economy

271
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,850
there are people who specialize in

272
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,920
finding routers and breaking into them

273
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,500
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling them to others who will</font>

274
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,689
then use them for their crime<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

275
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,190
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality today that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

276
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,310
happens you know buying and selling our

277
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,160
routers out there in the threat is

278
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,569
growing we've had you know like one of

279

282
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:55,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so what if seven sensors or one</font>

283
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,899
was used as an attack what if our

breaking into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> router from sending</font>

290
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,570
out hijack prefixes and things like that

291
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:17,579
all right do you trust them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

292
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,230
reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we see out there</font>

293
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,000
especially will<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see from where I work</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that before and where I work at now when</font>

295
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,240
you work with the customers out there is

296
00:12:22,589 --> 00:12:29,220
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you don't see a majority of</font>

297
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:33,750
service providers who actually filter on

298
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:36,510
the customer side right so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

299
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,240
the issues that will be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so</font>

300
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:40,800
what's the impact of it Oh garbage in

301
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,670
garbage out so you get a router

302
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:47,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home customer you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can make a</font>

303
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:49,199
mistake<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be attentional could be</font>

304
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,480
a spam job dog bad because people use

305
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,160
these for spams and also you say hey

306
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,700
let's advertise the entire internet with

307
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,560
/ 24 more all right small<font color="#CCCCCC"> letter drivers</font>

308
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:59,920
have a lot of memory these days right so

309
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,750
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to spoil a router you can</font>

310
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,300
go through and set up a little tool and

311
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:07,240
advertise internet / 24 and advertise

312
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,099
all out<font color="#CCCCCC"> so then that happens the two up</font>

313
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,200
streams at the the multi home customer

314
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,660
is connected to they go oh yeah no

315
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,139
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll accept those / 24 s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

316
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:20,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so then you have the internet</font>

317
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:21,310
strength except<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / 20 fillers and this</font>

318
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:24,190
gets propagated all throughout the

319
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">network I mean you know in BGP you know</font>

320
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,399
something happened on one side internet

321
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,589
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side here is about it sees</font>

322
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,670
about right so it gets propagated all

323
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:33,010
the way through if you don't set up

324
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,630
affect them properly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the rest of</font>

325
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,769
the internet you know minimally what's

326
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:37,779
going to happen is you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a</font>

327
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:38,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of activity it may not affect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

328
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:41,050
business but you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a</font>

329
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,570
locked<font color="#CCCCCC"> iffat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> e but you can see a lot</font>

330
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:45,250
more going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right let's advertise</font>

331
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,050
the entire net / 24 you can have

332
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:48,730
everything go you know headed head down

333
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:52,510
that way now similarly this step like

334
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:56,139
I've seen like in one country 99 I think

335
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:59,589
they one country advertised a / 8 out of

336
00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:02,800
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AP Nick block you know didn't</font>

337
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:04,300
configure the router properly and all

338
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,620
sudden you had all this traffic from

339
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">there you connect all head down to that</font>

340
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,310
one country boom the links go up and

341
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:12,459
let's say what to save the situation

342
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:15,579
with your links blew up right so the

343
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:18,310
links could congest bgp drops the

344
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:21,399
advertisement gets withdrawn right and

345
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:24,130
they flap about two hours that way<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

346
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so so you know let's take that</font>

347
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,000
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going out there and send</font>

348
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:31,089
out a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap Nick block I got a</font>

349
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,920
transoceanic link<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise it</font>

350
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:35,589
everybody since traffic down that link

351
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:39,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">the link saturate it drops I get it at</font>

352
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:41,260
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay everybody tries to stabilize</font>

353
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,060
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets a stabilizer link comes</font>

354
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,010
back up advertisement grows out here in

355
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,660
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes down and we go down again</font>

356
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this was going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour</font>

357
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:54,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so you get things like this</font>

358
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,699
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was causing a lot of pain</font>

359
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,589
throughout the net right so this sort of

360
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:01,469
stuff affects everybody who's connected

361
00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:04,630
with bgp in some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> shape or form</font>

362
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:08,760
alright so this garbage in garbage out

363
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:11,439
you know it does happen all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

364
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:13,500
fortunately we don't have people out

365
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,990
there who intentionally want to like

366
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,700
let's do this just to cause pain to

367
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,050
Nanette right you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to see</font>

368
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,160
the criminals go out there and do it

369
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,469
because the criminals are saying hey I

370
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,880
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make money so when you hear like</font>

371
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,040
you know team come early and others talk

372
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,450
about the mystery economy and stuff clin

373
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,800
laws don't you know stay away from these

374
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:30,870
attack vectors because there's no money

375
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,189
in it they want the nut to be there so

376
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,390
they make money off their other schemes

377
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">or going out there and stealing and</font>

378
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,780
doing thong crowd falls and things like

379
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:40,500
that right big you can't do a phishing

380
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:42,780
attack of the Nets not working right so

381
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,680
they'll keeping that up with that so so

382
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:48,180
but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we do got people out there</font>

383
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,890
who want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause terror and other</font>

384
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,599
activities out there and that's one of

385
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the threat vectors in there and we have</font>

386
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,220
situations<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with Pakistan and</font>

387
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,620
others with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is why</font>

388
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,330
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to care about these things we</font>

389
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,820
talked about these different mechanisms

390
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:08,550
to actually build more resiliency to

391
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:11,280
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> system i know i did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get running</font>

392
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:15,479
from run across 11 situation remarkably

393
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:17,610
like we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in you know</font>

394
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,500
in a prior in a prior company I worked

395
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,780
for a misconfigured load balancer

396
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,410
decided to announce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the / 16 as a series</font>

397
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,540
of /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 tues and took out pretty much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

398
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,100
region of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp because it was</font>

399
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,630
accepted and then propagated to the next

400
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:35,190
router and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then and then those routers</font>

401
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,960
crashed so the that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that was a</font>

402
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,420
danger<font color="#CCCCCC"> of even having a prefix filter</font>

403
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:46,890
where the prefix filter allowed a / 16

404
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:51,420
le 32 so yeah so yeah have you seen any

405
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:53,430
more from the operational days of uh no

406
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:57,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">I happy I've been very lucky</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't</font>

407
00:16:53,430 --> 00:17:00,510
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a very nano</font>

408
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:04,589
so oh isn't that good that it hasn't

409
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:06,270
affected me but that sense because I

410
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,780
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> being away in the bar these long</font>

411
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:15,990
time oceanic<font color="#CCCCCC"> minx did you take some</font>

412
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:17,879
problem there to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them yeah so the</font>

413
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,199
good news around all this is the

414
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,000
techniques we're talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

415
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,209
and that we will be talking about in

416
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,609
future tutorial sessions are not

417
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:28,439
techniques that need to be created

418
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,300
they're already there so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

419
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:31,800
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about anything that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

420
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,909
build this we haven't created this

421
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,639
technology yet we're talking about

422
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:37,290
technologies which exists today which

423
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,010
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can download today which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

424
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:43,409
configure today<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so we know these</font>

425
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:47,100
techniques work because we've seen like

426
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:48,360
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7001 I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people at service</font>

427
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,040
providers who said somebody had the

428
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,949
column the one know something was going

429
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,889
on because they had prefix filter and

430
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,450
policies that protected them and they

431
00:17:55,890 --> 00:18:00,600
saw no impact to their customer base

432
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:03,030
right so so we know these techniques

433
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,600
will work because the people who do it

434
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:09,990
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works for them right so so</font>

435
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,760
we're not talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you know things</font>

436
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:12,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is rocket science in the future</font>

437
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,390
these are things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go back</font>

438
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and and today or long down while you're</font>

439
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,000
in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at your</font>

440
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:21,240
network and thinking about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> would I</font>

441
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,860
do this on my own network bad news is we

442
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,230
got more and more multi-holder customers

443
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:27,990
increasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right because as more</font>

444
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,450
people depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on internet protocol as</font>

445
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,970
the televisions network of the future

446
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,440
and they need to be building resiliency

447
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,840
for their businesses they will be multi

448
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,760
home and out there and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> RB bgp</font>

449
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:42,030
speaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we've got more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

450
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,860
more this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad news out</font>

451
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's many times people will go out</font>

452
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:48,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even if a vendor goes out</font>

453
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,620
there makes a policy it says you cannot

454
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:51,210
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> them it into the router unless you</font>

455
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,949
set a password on well what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font>

456
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,960
do they put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> password in there that's</font>

457
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,240
easily guessable you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

458
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,100
let's put in cisco you know and the joke

459
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,220
is even on Jennifer Jennifer hours of

460
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,809
password to put in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco yeah so what</font>

461
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,530
do you do go out there and I do to

462
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,730
connect via telnet and go

463
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,370
when you pass what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you thi you try</font>

464
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cisco</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I booked into a router now</font>

465
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:13,090
somebody who has that low security

466
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,470
posture you have a beach so who's

467
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,970
somebody who's bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home and they</font>

468
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:20,110
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it got broken into</font>

469
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:23,980
right so there's there's more of this

470
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:28,959
stuff you know going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so so its impact</font>

471
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:30,580
with it the you know some of the attack

472
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,530
vectors you'll hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the denial</font>

473
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,360
service to customers if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hijack</font>

474
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,889
somebody a traffic redirection

475
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:38,590
interception like instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

476
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:40,240
people go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your dns server i'll have</font>

477
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,520
your dns server come to my dns server

478
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,350
because I'll hijack your IP address and

479
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,330
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you won't even know that</font>

480
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,679
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't resolved into your</font>

481
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:49,870
authority they'll be resolved into my

482
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,390
authority<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the result of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my authority</font>

483
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,620
what can I do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that dns information</font>

484
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so you can hijack a whole</font>

485
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,929
service over and do a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interest</font>

486
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:01,899
in things with it the prefix hijacking

487
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:04,510
and AAS hijack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen one case</font>

488
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,360
and one service ones custom of a service

489
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:09,040
bar getting an entire is hijacked when

490
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,659
somebody decided just<font color="#CCCCCC"> inject it on our</font>

491
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,680
system over<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other side</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

492
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service product</font>

493
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:17,470
accepted it it belonged to<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else</font>

494
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:19,600
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a ver ties here</font>

495
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:21,850
yes advertise here and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever</font>

496
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,510
was closes that's where you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

497
00:20:21,850 --> 00:20:27,010
so we see all sorts of it so I'll prefix

498
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:29,080
hijack just to clarify make sure

499
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:31,240
everybody's on the same page a prefix

500
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:36,189
hijack is he had a customer off the side

501
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,600
he has XYZ / 24 as a prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and you</font>

502
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,270
have somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the other side of that</font>

503
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,280
he breaks into a router and he decides I

504
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:44,680
want to pull all the traffic down for

505
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,629
that particular web server over here so

506
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:48,760
they haven't gone to<font color="#CCCCCC"> their web server</font>

507
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:51,910
have a go to my web server and so he

508
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,070
lava ties a more specific route on his

509
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:56,980
side in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net he advertised</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that more</font>

510
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:58,870
specific route and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that upstream does</font>

511
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,950
not factor that more specific route goes

512
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:05,469
out and traffic starts going there now

513
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,060
it may not be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire net dependent</font>

514
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,190
how the net set up because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it</font>

515
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">works is every single router makes its</font>

516
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,150
own decision every autonomous system

517
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,220
makes its own decision so it may be just

518
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,140
the autonomous system is closest to that

519
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,870
router who are making the decision but

520
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,490
if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a guy</font>

521
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:21,409
who's I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to do this and go to a</font>

522
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,270
web server and do it for you know

523
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,420
criminal purposes like that web server

524
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:30,470
is a bank for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance right as a form</font>

525
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:32,180
of hijack the bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> page you know if</font>

526
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:34,700
I get enough passwords on there that

527
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:36,559
could be a a profitable sort of criminal

528
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,440
activity and this is where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

529
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">as an intentional hi jack all right now</font>

530
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,470
we see this most of time the most

531
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:47,480
frequent activity we see with this will

532
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,340
be interesting offline<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people see</font>

533
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,460
more of it the most frequent hijacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

534
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,010
see with this sort of stuff is with spam

535
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:58,700
so what you'll have is somebody who

536
00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:01,550
takes a computer injects an address in

537
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,220
that belongs to somebody else sends out

538
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:06,080
their spam job right with the computer

539
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,480
that's behind the router and then

540
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,250
disconnect and they only do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

541
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,530
know you know be connected for like five

542
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,240
minutes spent out sent out a whole bunch

543
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:16,910
of emails and then disconnect and wait

544
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,910
and two hours later open up advertise

545
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:22,130
inject again disconnect and do that for

546
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:23,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of their spam job so we've seen</font>

547
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,510
those sort of things and that's for

548
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,059
spammers are the ones who usually buy up

549
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:32,120
broken into bgp routers these days<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

550
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:35,620
so they can do that sort of activity so

551
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:41,600
I don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys seen any other</font>

552
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:43,699
nefarious I Dax I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure what the</font>

553
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,309
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what the source of seen</font>

554
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,500
that seen the spammers I've seen as

555
00:22:46,309 --> 00:22:50,300
Famers do that but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't and I've</font>

556
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,580
seen other hijacks but i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure but</font>

557
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:55,419
i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure why they're hijacking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

558
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly doing it for some reason</font>

559
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:02,330
another nasty nastiness is when you

560
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:04,939
think about what if and this is the

561
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,309
white lift sort of scenarios what if you

562
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,749
add you know since these broken into

563
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:10,519
routers are being bought and sold on the

564
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,989
net and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> criminal on the ground what</font>

565
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,729
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you went out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there and bought 20 of</font>

566
00:23:11,989 --> 00:23:16,210
them and then with those 20 of them i

567
00:23:13,729 --> 00:23:19,429
decided to inject a whole bunch of

568
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:22,340
nastiness<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could d aggregate I could</font>

569

more clue in the community and we did

650
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:32,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a year and I actually worked</font>

and we you know had thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

people to do proper configurations that

just taught him how to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

657
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,360
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so so we kind of know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,180
because people don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any clue of</font>

661
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:55,970
how to do it properly it's a clue issue

662
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:58,130
right and if that clue issue is costing

663

me<font color="#E5E5E5"> money you know it's always amazing</font>

664
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,169
how the operator community would rather

00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,230
pay vendors

666
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:07,149
money for the equipment then the graph

667
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:09,970
there and work on finding ways to clean

668
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:11,469
it up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community you know so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

one place and holy years we've been

709
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:26,159
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is databases to store this</font>

710
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,289
information because were originally the

711
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,779
allocation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP numbers has come</font>

712
00:29:28,289 --> 00:29:32,519
from a ir who have had it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you know</font>

713
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:39,830
who is database so their parade of this

714
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:42,630
code you or say something please please

715
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,120
properly distinguish between

716
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:47,640
who is databases<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to the allocation</font>

717
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:52,709
registry and the routing registries

718
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:57,450
which you are calling IRR it's something

719
00:29:52,710 --> 00:30:01,070
different well something different in

720
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:06,780
the manner of the database in there that

721
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:10,020
is his so leveraging the same sort of

722
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:14,520
database in more hallways I would have

723
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:17,790
said well it's different type of data

724
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:22,350
and it's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of maintenance</font>

725
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:26,490
of the data the parties that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

726
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:29,459
allocating and and documenting

727
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:31,890
reallocations is actually creating

728
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,020
something very different from open

729
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:37,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">databases where everybody can store</font>

730
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:41,100
whatever he claims should be a correctly

731
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:47,490
routed rude oh yeah there is the this

732
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:50,250
the assertion of truth the IRS who have

733
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:52,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data and have given it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you they</font>

734
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,810
can assert that they have in fact in it

735
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,120
to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas another of notation kind</font>

736
00:30:54,810 --> 00:31:02,540
of circuit<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control of this</font>

737
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:05,489
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually having any</font>

738
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:12,060
authorization to do that I guess what

739
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're getting at but well yeah I'm</font>

740
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,600
saying is we could we can leverage this

741
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:20,550
this this software that's been produced

742
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:25,620
to our own advantage and is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

743
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:27,930
a path of URLs here for at least the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ird</font>

744
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,850
was developed by nerve and the right

745
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:34,740
database that another the internet

746
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:37,730
registries use and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll come to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IFC</font>

747
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,730
one bit

748
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:46,660
what I want to do is keep this simple as

749
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:50,410
a very said when we've gone through this

750
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:54,160
in the past we've sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of died in to</font>

751
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:56,010
what is our PSA or how<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great software</font>

752
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:59,260
and you all the stuff you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with it</font>

753
00:31:56,010 --> 00:32:02,170
and people's eyes glaze over so this is

754
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:06,879
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be difficult so what I'm hoping</font>

755
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:09,820
here to demonstrate is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can keep</font>

756
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">it simple by just speaking a small</font>

757
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:18,189
subset of our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl and further down the</font>

758
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,649
track you could go down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the depths</font>

759
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:23,410
and describe your policy in detail using

760
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:27,010
these tools if you wished but what we

761
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:28,750
want to do here is just encourage people

762
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:31,300
to start filtering and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

763
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:34,960
about building so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the small part</font>

764
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:38,560
of of just registering your customer

765
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,180
routes in a database that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you control as</font>

766
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,620
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scare people too</font>

767
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:46,300
much we want them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do stuff</font>

768
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:48,610
so add on there so if I'm an operator

769
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,370
today and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

770
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">missing is like if I call another knock</font>

771
00:32:51,370 --> 00:33:00,429
and I asked them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I see a prefix</font>

772
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:02,710
coming out of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network can you tell</font>

773
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">me whether that prefix is a customer of</font>

774
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,070
yours<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I got a conflict i</font>

775
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:08,380
think i've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a hijack i think that</font>

776
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:09,879
that prefix belongs my customer can you

777
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,820
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your database to figure that out</font>

778
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:13,840
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out you know</font>

779
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,550
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could be a multi-homed</font>

780
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,669
customer i'm not quite sure what's going

781
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:20,710
on right what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this and</font>

782
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:23,020
you as a service providers to be able to

783
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:26,050
quickly look in your own database to say

784
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:29,620
yes this is true or yes this is not true

785
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:31,540
based off of your policies I'll many

786
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,760
times when I've been asked to help work

787
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:36,159
some hijacks I'll call the service by

788
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,350
door they all<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me check this when we</font>

789
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,790
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's over at this</font>

790
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:42,040
data wait a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute maybe over in that</font>

791
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:44,230
database you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know or let me pull up the</font>

792
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:47,080
Excel spreadsheet because we keep it all

793
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,030
in Excel spreadsheet or that's over in

794
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">the sales provision in database we don't</font>

795
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:51,489
have it

796
00:33:49,539 --> 00:33:53,139
were linked to over here in a route and

797
00:33:51,489 --> 00:33:55,119
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd been a little bit on the</font>

798
00:33:53,139 --> 00:33:57,129
rabaa yeah yeah a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times they get</font>

799
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:01,509
on a router and says well I don't see it

800
00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:04,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the router but uh you sure you're</font>

801
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:08,199
sure were advertised in it I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had that</font>

802
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:10,059
too yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a half-step</font>

803
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,578
before before getting into customers

804
00:34:10,059 --> 00:34:14,230
routes which is your own routes so the

805
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:17,409
routes you yourself have been given by

806
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:20,440
the IRS that route registering those

807
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:26,500
first before the ones you give out to

808
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:27,819
other people is even a step<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so what</font>

809
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,589
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at is when we look at all</font>

810
00:34:27,819 --> 00:34:30,989
the different work of us don't forward

811
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:33,069
how do we increment how do we get better

812
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:36,250
post-mortem to what we saw with the

813
00:34:33,069 --> 00:34:39,219
Pakistan YouTube incident is is focus on

814
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:41,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that service fire should have a central</font>

815
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:43,058
repository that they can pull upon if

816
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:45,099
you have a central repository you can

817
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:47,470
pull upon with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> rutten policy</font>

818
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:49,659
information we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a whole</font>

819
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:51,609
span of work tools of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work that you can</font>

820
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:58,030
use and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use this tool set for a</font>

821
00:34:51,609 --> 00:35:01,058
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of things you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know stupid</font>

822
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:03,730
question as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're talking it sounds</font>

823
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:07,000
like you are not making a point out of

824
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:09,849
that well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all this data should be</font>

825
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,069
published in a way so that everybody can

826
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:17,440
have access to it that's certainly ideal

827
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:20,470
so so what we wanted a lot of times we

828
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:22,750
emphasize that point first<font color="#E5E5E5"> before you</font>

829
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,970
have it where your own management can

830
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,740
get to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

831
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:31,089
it the business processes when I look at

832
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:33,759
service provider as a business I look at

833
00:35:31,089 --> 00:35:35,650
sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> these access to this provision and</font>

834
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,270
people need access to this your<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

835
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:40,569
policy needs access to this a lot of

836
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:45,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">people need access to it if you get that</font>

837
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:48,279
problem fixed first and you're using the

838
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">tools that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have been created for this to</font>

839
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,740
do it then it's then the next step would

840
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,808
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here so everybody can</font>

841
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,430
then outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community if I'm</font>

842
00:35:55,809 --> 00:36:00,250
another service far I can then use your

843
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:01,450
database as the authority for your

844
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,920
policy

845
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:07,390
and I can publish that and mirror that

846
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:09,250
out we all agree it's absolutely

847
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:11,680
essential<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have this database to know</font>

848
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:14,230
what prefixes your advertising yourself

849
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,770
what prefixes your customers are giving

850
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,540
you to advertise it would be very good

851
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:20,800
if everyone were willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share that</font>

852
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,779
data with each other because<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

853
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,250
could make much better filters problem

854
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:26,349
is you'd also be sharing your customer

855
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:30,430
list with your competitors some people

856
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:34,089
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jacked well but but to answer</font>

857
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:35,319
that to be fair the customers are

858
00:36:34,089 --> 00:36:37,029
already shared if you're if you're

859
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,550
routing their routes on the internet

860
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,310
everybody can<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see them if you if</font>

861
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:44,680
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you if you object to publish your</font>

862
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:47,020
customers routes to vote to the routing

863
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:49,359
table to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the global network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

864
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:58,180
you will you will you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> at see your</font>

865
00:36:49,359 --> 00:37:01,630
customers leave point well taken yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

866
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:04,950
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what we try that this time it</font>

867
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:07,960
is try and work out perhaps thing

868
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:10,118
reasons why perhaps it didn't work last

869
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:12,460
time whoa why we had all this training

870
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,579
and still there was not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

871
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:18,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">appointment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this stuff so this time</font>

872
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:20,680
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're thinking that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perhaps if we</font>

873
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,980
target what therefore it is for you

874
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:25,419
first rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your peers may</font>

875
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:28,599
benefit from having that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

876
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:31,569
available so if if you do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for</font>

877
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,660
yourself then there's a benefit to the

878
00:37:31,569 --> 00:37:36,910
community by<font color="#CCCCCC"> you tightening up your own</font>

879
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:40,660
backyard and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the controllers that you</font>

880
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:43,240
might place on the announcements you

881
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,759
relate out of internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the next step</font>

882
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:48,069
is then a small set to say okay I've got

883
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,750
this data I'm familiar with the tools

884
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:52,869
I'm comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this available</font>

885
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,490
later though now I can actually export

886
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:56,859
it and make it useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for other people</font>

887
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:58,839
to let now leverage this information but

888
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:01,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you get to the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of of its</font>

889
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:03,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that that you know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

890
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer is your customer and these are</font>

891
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:08,380
the routes they've told you you've that

892
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,598
you're you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect from them and</font>

893
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,599
you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> some back-office process to</font>

894
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:14,580
to verify that these valves<font color="#E5E5E5"> are telling</font>

895
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,520
you I there's

896
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:21,029
in fact there's but then if you publish

897
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:24,930
that inflation<font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet your</font>

898
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:27,510
peer may not believe you because<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

899
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:32,899
moment there is no way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you verifying</font>

900
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:37,200
that yet this the the chain of authority

901
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,910
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the customer to you being</font>

902
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to announce that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route especially</font>

903
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:49,049
if it's not a BGP customer well in most

904
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:52,020
parts of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately what</font>

905
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:55,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">you are saying is true it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't need</font>

906
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,630
to be so because the technology that's

907
00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:00,450
out there and has been deployed over a

908
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:04,620
decade actually allows for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example in</font>

909
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:08,160
Europe that the ripe<font color="#CCCCCC"> RI our delegations</font>

910
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:10,740
are in the database and the security

911
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,149
technology pretty weak stuff but still

912
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:18,450
security of some kind allows to actually

913
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,700
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the authorization or while okay only</font>

914
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:25,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the authorization is really there to</font>

915
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:27,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually register the roots so while</font>

916
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:30,870
okay actually there you have a chain

917
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:33,930
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> entrance and stronger mechanisms</font>

918
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:38,490
and databases are forthcoming and will

919
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:40,759
be luckily<font color="#E5E5E5"> available globally there I</font>

920
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:44,220
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start this process</font>

921
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,380
in parallel to that think of it as this

922
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:50,250
part of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> pilot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> planner certainly not</font>

923
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:54,000
Europe<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> become your is this slow yeah</font>

924
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:56,010
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the bad side is that while</font>

925
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,010
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually building your own database</font>

926
00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:01,860
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then publish</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out from there is kind</font>

927
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:05,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">of not going to help for the strong</font>

928
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:07,590
stuff that's going to come and actually

929
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:10,170
and actually and actually starting

930
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:11,940
starting the way that you first make

931
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:14,490
sure that everything that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

932
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:18,510
actually injecting into the network goes

933
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:20,970
to in a public documentation and becomes

934
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,250
available for everybody actually allows

935
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,700
you to also use the public document

936
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:28,950
documentation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your internal purposes</font>

937
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:32,460
so while okay that's at least a

938
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:34,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">different way which actually jumps over</font>

939
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:40,700
the first step that you are proposing

940
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:45,840
first building your own database the

941
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:48,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">chat the challenge is when we have one</font>

942
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:51,690
we approached this years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago as as start</font>

943
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,100
with start by joining up the joining up

944
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:56,040
and publishing all of all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing</font>

945
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:59,190
policy and in the in the public irrs it

946
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:02,759
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done so that there there there is</font>

947
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,400
a resistance to 22<font color="#E5E5E5"> going straight to</font>

948
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:07,590
that whereas<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is there's an obvious</font>

949
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:09,720
business benefit to having all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

950
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:12,300
information in a single place all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

951
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,589
various business consulting type people

952
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">are are getting big on on single</font>

953
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,170
databases and single authoritative

954
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,900
databases in there get there getting

955
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:23,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">there getting into that idea now so so</font>

956
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,200
that's an easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell to management to say</font>

957
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:28,680
there ought to be a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> place where</font>

958
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,500
we know our own customers and really and

959
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:35,160
its impact an obvious thing to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

960
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">wait we don't have that so this is a the</font>

961
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,420
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can answer a question so</font>

962
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:40,950
when some other provider calls you is

963
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,200
from other providers not calls you up

964
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:45,770
and says gee is so-and-so your customer

965
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,560
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say yes or no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> authoritative</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee</font>

966
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:51,000
without having<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be an ordeal that I</font>

967
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,970
mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an obvious business benefit</font>

968
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,820
now that is that is an easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> sell to</font>

969
00:41:53,970 --> 00:42:00,330
management as opposed to changing the

970
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:03,270
way the way people do business which is

971
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:06,390
harder I mean it's harder to go to go

972
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:08,370
directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to well we're not we're gonna</font>

973
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:09,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to require</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that all that all</font>

974
00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:12,000
of the policies all of our routing

975
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:14,460
policies are influenced by publicly

976
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,890
available data is it's a it's a hardware

977
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,090
immediate sale and until you start

978
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:22,470
seeing the benefit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the benefits from</font>

979
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:25,290
the publication okay well okay I'm

980
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:27,959
seeing I'm seeing the problems and well

981
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:30,450
okay I have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> watching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for quite some</font>

982
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,670
here and seeing that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

983
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,549
things that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

984
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:38,299
really but well okay i get i get i<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

985
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:41,929
funny feeling when you say the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID</font>

986
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:44,538
of a single database is so obvious when

987
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:46,789
thinking about it I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like well okay</font>

988
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:50,779
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 different</font>

989
00:42:46,789 --> 00:42:54,019
single databases which seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be kind</font>

990
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:56,150
of a contradiction in terms but inside

991
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:58,160
the single organization yes but well

992
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,759
okay the prob one of the one of the

993
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,939
problems of of having multiple databases

994
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:09,380
usually is redundant storage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

995
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:11,420
information and and and and redundant

996
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:15,619
storage of information where you claim

997
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:18,529
that each copy of a storage<font color="#CCCCCC"> is operative</font>

998
00:43:15,619 --> 00:43:23,959
quite obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the even more creepy</font>

999
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:26,029
thing right so well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and what I'm</font>

1000
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:30,890
what I'm seeing what I'm seeing is that

1001
00:43:26,029 --> 00:43:33,589
while okay we are hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> very close</font>

1002
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:39,410
to getting a globally homogeneous

1003
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:42,558
database for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of data that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

1004
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:44,449
hopefully the single database that's

1005
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,339
that's going to that's going to actually

1006
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:47,900
move a trick and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

1007
00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:53,499
leave a private thing of a single

1008
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,499
company half a year away

1009
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:12,530
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I've the multitude of</font>

1010
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:15,650
objects but who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> database provides</font>

1011
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,780
this this is the core one as far as to

1012
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years ago is concerned it's the</font>

1013
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:24,890
route object a you look at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get</font>

1014
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:27,590
oh my god but as you may notice most of

1015
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:32,330
this stuff is optional and probably how

1016
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:35,000
the anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else who uses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so you get I</font>

1017
00:44:32,330 --> 00:44:38,690
go to an example which is fairly ancient

1018
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,800
a number a number of jobs ago stolen out

1019
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:45,980
of an old slide pack it this was one of

1023
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:55,280
takeovers but this gives you an example

1024
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:59,060
of the base information that's stored so

1025

some to store information about the

the matter the maintainer record and you

<font color="#E5E5E5">may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be manipulating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1046
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:11,990
using this so we started using

1047
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:14,959
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> adjusted didn't go anywhere and this</font>

1048
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:17,720
is a source the sources they identify

1049
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,280
for the database that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this record is in</font>

1050
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:28,640
and this is our<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DB not the internal</font>

1051
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:31,490
connect database so over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years every</font>

1052
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,879
this there been another people who have

1053
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:36,790
developed software some of it in house

1054
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:41,480
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is never escape some of it is</font>

1055
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:44,810
public domain the people have just

1056
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:47,690
written code that sends quiz<font color="#E5E5E5"> to who is</font>

1057
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:50,090
service to pull these entries back at

1058
00:46:47,690 --> 00:46:53,600
the better there's a toolset that is

1059
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:56,390
sort of looked after by is see where

1060
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked after should be an inverted</font>

1061
00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:03,410
quotes because really they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing</font>

1062
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:06,980
a very good job but it does<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist and</font>

1063
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,109
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download it and it probably</font>

1064
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,869
fairly hideous to build but don't go

1065
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:14,380
there but it does support quitting two

1066
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:17,210
of the who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that two types of who is</font>

1067
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:20,510
service and as piece of software<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1068
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">there that can actually write code</font>

1069
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:30,290
fragments for routers so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

1070
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:32,779
some some more code segments that have

1071
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:35,330
worked together to illustrate how you

1072
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:39,140
might do it if if all your intent is

1073
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:42,020
just to pull about objects out of a

1074
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">database that are associated with and is</font>

1075
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">now what you can do is with the route</font>

1076
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:50,720
objects is you can query a database and

1077
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:53,419
ask it for put an inverse query on<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1078
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:56,060
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me all about objects that have an</font>

1079
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,890
origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a particular a s and then it</font>

1080
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:59,690
will give you a whole list of these and

1081
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:00,980
this is how we're going to you what

1082
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:03,680
we're going to use to actually build the

1083
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:10,369
filters so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a bit of</font>

1084
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:12,680
template that is static so you put this

1085
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:15,080
in in a file and load into the router

1086
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:19,430
and forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it usually so this is</font>

1087
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:21,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">in fact appearing policy-setting local</font>

1088
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:24,720
preference setting some<font color="#E5E5E5"> be GV q</font>

1089
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:29,490
it is for the main thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

1090
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:33,350
it's going to act on a route filter to

1091
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:35,879
select routes it's going to accept and

1092
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:42,620
so here's what here's the base template

1093
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:47,790
for the policy fragment<font color="#CCCCCC"> our SAS 69 39</font>

1094
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:53,130
again that's static<font color="#CCCCCC"> now here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

1095
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:57,480
bit of code from up the RT config that's

1096
00:48:53,130 --> 00:49:02,250
going to populate the prefixes term to

1097
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:08,490
do a match on all the route objects that

1098
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:13,590
have an origin is of 69 39 and that

1099
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:19,680
bigger than a or equal to 0 / 24 and

1100
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:26,010
they're not part of Martians and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'm</font>

00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:46,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yeah yeah there was a piece of</font>

quality some parent fundamentals so

1138
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,890
let's step back out of the policy policy

we're appearing with each other we've

agreed upon what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send them</font>

1154
00:51:56,529 --> 00:52:01,329
I put an egress filter out to say here's

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send them they set up an ingress</font>

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of check and balance is kind of how</font>

1158
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:11,380
we've kind of built the net with it now

1159

a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times people forget that and</font>

1165
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:27,490
what I receive have agreed upon contract

1166
00:52:25,089 --> 00:52:29,140
and a lot of the large<font color="#CCCCCC"> rsps this is</font>

1167
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:30,729
country actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> spelt out you have a</font>

1168
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:32,200
contract and says here's exactly what

1169
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,329
goes between these two parties<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1170
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:37,240
there's a contract and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

1171
00:52:34,329 --> 00:52:39,539
build a filter on both sides to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enforce</font>

1172
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:42,008
the contract with it alright so that's

1173
00:52:39,539 --> 00:52:43,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">principle with it so you got to know</font>

1174
00:52:42,009 --> 00:52:45,730
though what you're going to send right

1175
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:48,368
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this goes back to knowing your</font>

1176
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:50,019
network right and and setting up on the

1177
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:53,380
customer side so<font color="#E5E5E5"> where should you filter</font>

1178
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:55,000
well so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one this is obvious</font>

1179
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:56,859
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to emphasize this point over</font>

1180
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,750
over again<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer</font>

1181
00:52:56,859 --> 00:53:00,369
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright anything coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from your</font>

1182
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers you need to put a filter there</font>

1183
00:53:00,369 --> 00:53:03,819
to filter coming in because and this is

1184
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:06,519
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the areas we see as big lock in</font>

1185
00:53:03,819 --> 00:53:07,808
you know lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people got the filters</font>

1186
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:09,788
coming from there up strings and their

1187
00:53:07,809 --> 00:53:11,109
peers<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's that's not rocket</font>

1188
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:12,700
science so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1189
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:14,619
filters there the<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength of those</font>

1190
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,058
filters may be in question but we do

1191
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:18,400
have the filter and coming coming in

1192
00:53:16,059 --> 00:53:19,779
from there a problem set that we have in

1193
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:21,940
the community is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> filtering on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1194
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:24,099
side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer side that's the</font>

1195
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,470
big big gap in there and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we</font>

1196
00:53:24,099 --> 00:53:29,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes usually come from</font>

1197
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:31,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright the other areas we have what we</font>

1198
00:53:29,259 --> 00:53:32,950
call policy containment filters in other

1199
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:34,240
words set up the filters on the egress

1200
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:36,250
you'll set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up your filter and say here's</font>

1201
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:38,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">what I send to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you based off a business</font>

1202
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:40,599
practice but a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times people don't</font>

1203
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:43,299
think through containment filters well

1204
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:46,000
if Murphy's Law of networking kicks in

1205
00:53:43,299 --> 00:53:47,759
and takes over<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so Murphy's Law</font>

1206
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,500
anything that can go wrong will go wrong

1207
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:53,349
Murphy's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Law off networking anything can</font>

1208
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:55,450
go wrong will go wrong at just when<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1209
00:53:53,349 --> 00:53:57,400
your customers are online all using

1210
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">networks simultaneously at your peak</font>

1211
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,920
hours

1212
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:03,098
so the Murphy's Law of<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking is</font>

1213
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:05,500
really bad this this kind of happens out

1214
00:54:03,099 --> 00:54:06,640
there and you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the MIT pop not</font>

1215
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,710
the massachusetts institute of

1216
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,950
technology but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing was real into</font>

1217
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:13,930
me from the radar days is if this is

1218
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:16,598
maintenance injected trouble<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1219
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:18,160
so you know you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

1220
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:20,710
maintenance injected trouble into your

1221
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,049
system they're so so and that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1222
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:24,670
times happens yes one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one other</font>

1223
00:54:23,049 --> 00:54:26,140
boundary in addition to the EVGA p

1224
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:28,930
boundaries with customers is the

00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:31,420
internal ebgp boundaries between

1226
00:54:28,930 --> 00:54:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">confederations is looking at the areas</font>

1227
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:36,549
in inside renekton schneider at work and

1228
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:38,529
making sure that that you don't allow

1229
00:54:36,549 --> 00:54:41,410
against an instability that gets

1230
00:54:38,529 --> 00:54:43,720
introduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by by the failure of a custom</font>

00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:44,950
of a customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix filter to propagate</font>

1232
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,589
across your network and break the

1233
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:49,629
routers on the other side also so that's

1234
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:50,920
that's another another area to watch out

1235
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:54,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">for even beyond the communities you have</font>

1236
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:56,349
areas now that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> large ISPs</font>

1237
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:58,869
are large and geographically dispersed

1238
00:54:56,349 --> 00:55:01,539
you have natural natural points where

1239
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:03,460
you can put containment filters to keep

1240
00:55:01,539 --> 00:55:06,099
damage within your network contained to

1241
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:09,190
a certain geographical area you know

1242
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:10,720
transoceanic systems intercontinental

1243
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,480
big backbone links things like that you

1244
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">can you can kind of see how they are and</font>

1245
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:20,579
I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> some service bars do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort</font>

1246
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:23,920
of containment on a geographic boundary

1247
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:25,660
so but then you go like well all my

1248
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home customers you know what I do</font>

1249
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,589
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home customers you know it</font>

1250
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:31,569
gets hard keeping track of all those

1251
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">sorts sort of things you know you got to</font>

1252
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:35,619
know what you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> except and where</font>

1253
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:37,509
you're going to advertise bigness is not

1254
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:39,519
really an excuse and this I've heard

1255
00:55:37,509 --> 00:55:41,170
this from a lot of big providers to say

1256
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,299
oh I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work</font>

1257
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:45,730
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I see another big provider and</font>

1258
00:55:43,299 --> 00:55:49,180
it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> work so what happens with this</font>

1259
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:51,099
is you know containment<font color="#E5E5E5"> filters you go</font>

1260
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,930
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sanara so no let's advertise it</font>

1261
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:54,400
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> stash the entire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last twenty-four if</font>

1262
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:57,578
you have these containment filters in

1263
00:55:54,400 --> 00:56:00,190
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and say the filter breaks</font>

1264
00:55:57,579 --> 00:56:01,750
and you know my customer filter my

1265
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,690
customer filter says I shouldn't know

1266
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:07,420
how all these last 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that breaks</font>

1267
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:09,640
right because somebody forgot to apply

1268
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">something on a provider edge router and</font>

1269
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:14,890
that happens that's just human

1270
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:16,899
entropy to a system right if I have a

1271
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:20,109
containment filter that says I do not

1272
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:23,440
export / 24 is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my system right</font>

1273
00:56:20,109 --> 00:56:25,690
then those / 24 is would have gone from

00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:27,730
your customer into your network and then

1275
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:29,920
hit your border and because you put a

1276
00:56:27,730 --> 00:56:31,299
policy and they say no 24 is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

1277
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,280
network because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to send any</font>

1278
00:56:31,299 --> 00:56:36,759
24 is out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my network they would hit</font>

1279
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:39,490
your egress filter and stopped<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1280
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,170
that's thinking ahead of saying that yes

1281
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:43,180
I felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my customers but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what are the</font>

1282
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:45,670

1283
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:48,490
that filter on my egress policy which is

1284
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:50,020
what up stock breaks what am I going to

1285
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:52,328
do how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I put things in there to</font>

1286
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,190
contain the problem because what is the

1287
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:57,940
damage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you start sending out /</font>

nobody told us that we have all these

1347
00:59:12,940 --> 00:59:19,180
new features so vendors great<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco</font>

juniper<font color="#CCCCCC"> foundry all those vendors we do</font>

1349
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:23,980
a very poor job of updating the broad

1350
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:26,078
community that hey we have this band new

1351
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:28,510
feature because we're so business-driven

1352
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,369
you know you're my customer and you're

1353
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:31,900
telling me get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this feature in or I</font>

1354
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:33,309
won't buy your equipment so we put that

1355
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:35,980
feature in you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this feature and</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy and we make the deal and we</font>

1357
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,240
go to the next deal right and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1358
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:42,220
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and tell everybody else hey we</font>

1360
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,549
who wanted it was this customer and they

they bought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

1362
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:49,839
business dynamic going on so vendors are

1363
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:52,180
not incentivized to go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1364
00:59:49,839 --> 00:59:53,349

1366
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:57,339
business driver as a vendor we're

1367
00:59:54,849 --> 00:59:59,589
looking at next deals<font color="#CCCCCC"> right as a result</font>

1368
00:59:57,339 --> 01:00:01,420
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get all these features out there so</font>

1369
00:59:59,589 --> 01:00:03,220
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things to go look at</font>

1370
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:05,710
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't pulled your vendor in or</font>

1371
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:07,240
vendors in plural and says give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

1372
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:09,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">review of every single feature you got</font>

1373
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:11,140
in BGP you know tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me all the ones I</font>

1374
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:13,180
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about that it may not be</font>

1375
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:15,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">using that could make my life easier</font>

1376
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:19,690
right so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the areas of</font>

1377
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:21,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">review with it some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things what</font>

1378
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:23,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">the prefix filtered on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> especially on</font>

1379
01:00:21,369 --> 01:00:24,700
these things that are not rocket science

1380
01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:28,839
doesn't need a special use addresses we

1381
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:31,180
now have RFC 3338 is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> up there there</font>

1382
01:00:28,839 --> 01:00:33,819
are designated for special use that you

1383
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:36,460
know we shouldn't see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net right</font>

1384
01:00:33,819 --> 01:00:38,589
so if you sit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see them on a net you</font>

1385
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,770
know you can filter them out safely all

1386
01:00:38,589 --> 01:00:41,470
right

1387
01:00:38,770 --> 01:00:43,030
and you know some of these you know for

1388
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:45,609
instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got these addresses out</font>

1389
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:47,230
there you know loopback some private

1390
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:49,030
nets and things like that pretty pretty

1391
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:51,550
obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> ends of list here all right so</font>

1392
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:52,990
these are quite obvious ones that go

1393
01:00:51,550 --> 01:01:11,560
through and the filters aren't hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1394
01:00:52,990 --> 01:01:14,819
build bull guns Oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean yes yes so and</font>

1395
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:18,040
the update<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we got some addresses like</font>

1396
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:20,650
the lower boundaries right being

1397
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:23,920
allocated out right so we have and

1398
01:01:20,650 --> 01:01:26,050
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> 33-30 does it good</font>

1399
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,210
writeup when you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> description</font>

1400
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:31,510
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of them so you pull that RFC</font>

1401
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:33,550
out you know you look at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's</font>

1402
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:38,200
addresses which are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> boundaries of</font>

1403
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:39,910
like you know the b-class and<font color="#CCCCCC"> c class</font>

1404
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,830
and those<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and those those are</font>

1405
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">ones that are could be allocatable now</font>

1406
01:01:41,830 --> 01:01:46,240
so they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work the allocations</font>

1407
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:47,950
for those so and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> well document</font>

1408
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,259
in here they say they may be allocated

1409
01:01:47,950 --> 01:01:52,540
in the future and what shawne's pointing

1410
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:54,430
out is they will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> allocated in the</font>

1411
01:01:52,540 --> 01:02:00,250
future I n is coming out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a document</font>

1412
01:01:54,430 --> 01:02:04,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says they will be yeah they will</font>

1413
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:06,160
they will allocate out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogan</font>

1414
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:09,250
addresses which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gets along with</font>

1415
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:11,920
this you know this one source over here

1416
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:13,450
which is Diana assignments is where the

1417
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,580
kind of source<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for the bull guns</font>

1418
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:18,220
now what a bogan is is space that has

1419
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:20,650
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been allocated by a Anna and</font>

1420
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:22,450
there's a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> agana maintains it says</font>

1421
01:02:20,650 --> 01:02:26,880
here's what we've allocated here's whom

1422
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:29,950
we've allocated to with<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are IRS</font>

1423
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,930
which interesting is is we're

1424
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:33,370
approaching the point where bogans are a

1425
01:02:31,930 --> 01:02:35,259
thing of the past because<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

1426
01:02:33,370 --> 01:02:37,330
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be allocated out and then you'll</font>

1427
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:38,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to not go Diana cuz I am it will</font>

1428
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:41,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">say everything's allocated out in IP</font>

1429
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:42,730
version 4 and moving on IP version 6 and

1430
01:02:41,470 --> 01:02:44,500
what they're allocating and then IP

1431
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:46,630
version 4 you'd need to go down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1432
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:48,490
regional registries they get the details

1433
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:51,100
from them to find out what what's out

1434
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:52,180
there several<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

1435
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,950
got together and started

gone it's active it's a starting point

1438
01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:01,660
or I've collected all the information

<font color="#E5E5E5">about bogan filtering you know what you</font>

we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten plays out there to help</font>

1443
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,480
people get started with filter and these

1444
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:11,920
are templates are designed to be cut and

1445
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,180
paste if you haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> any filtering</font>

1446
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,950
before and you want to do an ingress

1447
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:16,529
filter you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take these filters and</font>

1448
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:20,680
cut and paste them into a router and

1449
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:23,290
they'll work don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> bind minds is a</font>

1450
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:24,848
little bit it's mine saw three two

1451
01:03:23,290 --> 01:03:27,490
versions behind so I got up take mine on

1452

there there's three<font color="#E5E5E5"> modes dojo and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boog</font>

you is you have to maintain this right

1459
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:46,660
iono keeps on allocating right hey if

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't build on filtering and I Anna</font>

1461
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:50,410
allocates a block out there you know you

got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain it you got to update it</font>

1463
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:52,960
you know you get a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it every</font>

1464
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,579
month and find out these new allocations

1465
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,470
I got to change it otherwise you're

1466
01:03:54,579 --> 01:03:58,180
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people on a net who are</font>

1467
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:59,410
getting new addresses out of new address

1469

01:04:00,609 --> 01:04:05,890
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to them so what team</font>

1471
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:08,170
company did is they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's set up a</font>

1472
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:10,390
BGP router and we'll do it EBT be

1473
01:04:08,170 --> 01:04:12,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihop to you and you set up a filter</font>

1474
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:13,569
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this particular community</font>

1475
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:15,730
for these bogans they'll advertise the

1476
01:04:13,569 --> 01:04:17,920
bull guns to you you set the filter to

1477
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:20,109
null 0 it so you know they're all the

1478
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,210
routes and drop the prefixes so you

1479
01:04:20,109 --> 01:04:24,069
don't carry them so you get a benefit of

1480
01:04:22,210 --> 01:04:25,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the no zero benefit and you also get the</font>

1481
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:28,089
benefit of not routing them out there

1482
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:31,680
and the details and<font color="#E5E5E5"> instructions all on</font>

1483
01:04:28,089 --> 01:04:34,779
that page there's some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> use that</font>

1484
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:39,220
any an example problem with with static

1485
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:41,349
log on static rogue on<font color="#CCCCCC"> list I there were</font>

1486
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:43,509
all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems getting a 69 x for</font>

1487
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:45,640
quite a while and Cisco's auto secure

1488
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:49,329
feature included a static<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vogon list for</font>

1489
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:50,828
file that so it would be whatever it was

1490
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:53,589
that the version at the time the iOS was

1491
01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:56,040
created it and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was right</font>

1492
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:58,860
for about<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight minutes so</font>

1493
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:00,570
so that that that and it tended to be

1494
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:05,880
done but to be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by people who are</font>

1495
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:08,730
not then maintaining a list so yeah so

1496
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:10,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the net police concept this is a</font>

1497
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:12,750
filtering concept that as you come come

1498
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:15,240
come up with how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you set up your</font>

1499
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:17,190
filtering architecture yes can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

1500
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,589
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bogan stuff but I think it</font>

1501
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:22,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">is important to clarify that using the</font>

1502
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:24,390
bogan feed means you will most likely if

1503
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:26,880
you follow the instructions have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1504
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:28,980
routes for the aggregates<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you learn</font>

1505
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,200
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bogue on servers but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> until you</font>

1506
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:33,180
do the route filtering you don't prevent

1507
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:37,169
yourself from learning any more

1508
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:39,899
specifics from within that range that's

1509
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:42,420
true so there's a lot of ability I get

1510
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,010
overridden right which is why I you know

1511
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:47,900
do the manual do the men<font color="#E5E5E5"> are filtered</font>

1512
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:50,010
that's true then think through<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

1513
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,770
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't used it as summarized</font>

1514
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:55,110
just advertising the camry those

1515
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:57,450
services is there of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course I you know</font>

1516
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:59,220
I'm usually I'm a manual sort of guy I

1517
01:05:57,450 --> 01:06:01,080
like to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> my own database and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then do</font>

1518
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:05,089
my own configs and have control over my

1519
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:07,200
configs is my personal management style

1520
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:08,460
but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put all the options out</font>

1521
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,919
there because different people different

1522
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:13,770
networks have different requirements so

1523
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:16,170
net police filtering um this is coin<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1524
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:18,900
termed years ago they softer this

1525
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:20,940
philosophy of basic taken what the

1526
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,950
regional registries give as their

1527
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:24,390
boundaries of allocation so a regional

1528
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:26,549
registry will get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big block for my</font>

1529
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Anna the regional registry then has a</font>

1530
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:30,630
policy group and since each regional

1531
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:33,570
registry is a bottomless up policy

1532
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:37,020
mechanism manage the membership figures

1533
01:06:33,570 --> 01:06:40,350
out what their policy should be right so

1534
01:06:37,020 --> 01:06:41,790
right are in la<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick ap neck they all</font>

1535
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,350
figure out what their policy should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1536
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:45,540
and then they say here's our policy and

1537
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:49,259
the policy would be say okay for this

1538
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:53,279
block of addresses are minimal practical

1539
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:54,480
allocation you know is a / 20 in other

1540
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,430
words we're not going to allocate any

1541
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,970
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to allocate 21</font>

1544
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,669
19 will do 18 but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that that will be a venerable</font>

1548

boundary and then someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> came with idea</font>

1549
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:15,960
says hey you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of upgrading</font>

1550
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:19,220
my router is because I get all these pre

1551
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:24,359
texts I don't really need to carry I'll

1552
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:26,368
filter on that boundary I'll just filter

1553
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:29,098
on that boundary because I as a business

1554
01:07:26,369 --> 01:07:31,200
decide that this is what I'll do that's

1555
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:33,809
where this this idea came<font color="#CCCCCC"> from as they</font>

1556
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:35,848
say first the IRS came out with this

1557
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:39,420
concept minimal practical allocation and

1558
01:07:35,849 --> 01:07:41,099
then a couple of businesses right these

1559
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:42,569
are service providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> our peers the</font>

1560
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:44,040
abundant as<font color="#CCCCCC"> our business came up with a</font>

1561
01:07:42,569 --> 01:07:45,450
business decision says look I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

1562
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to carry all this extra stuff that</font>

1563
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:49,078
doesn't do me or my customers and you

1564
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,359
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't carry it I'll just</font>

1565
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:53,760
felt thrown that bounder so there's two

1566
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,410
modes of doing this there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode</font>

1567
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,089
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the minimal tropical</font>

1568
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:58,589
locations and you filter hard on it

1569
01:07:57,089 --> 01:08:00,210
whatever whatever the regional

1570
01:07:58,589 --> 01:08:02,930
registries say that's why filter on and

1571
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:07,530
then the other way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it is to say</font>

1572
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:09,930
here's my I'll just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all at 24 so</font>

1573
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:12,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first way we call a strict mode a</font>

1574
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:14,040
second way to call loose mode alright so

1575
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:17,549
the strict way and a loose loose loose

1576
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:19,560
mode of doing it right there are sites

1577
01:08:17,549 --> 01:08:22,229
each of the regional registries have

1578
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:24,330
different sites that they say here is

1579
01:08:22,229 --> 01:08:26,549
all of our allocations and here's a

1580
01:08:24,330 --> 01:08:28,500
minimal boundaries for each of them

1581
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:30,569
right so they'll settle all up so it's

1582
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:33,330
all well document on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net it's easy</font>

1583
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:36,750
to go check on to do to do that sort of

1584
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:38,519
work for that and you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

1585
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:40,738
example of what a filter would look so

1586
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:42,449
this is like a strict mode where I say

1587
01:08:40,738 --> 01:08:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is an AP Nick filter and this</font>

1588
01:08:42,448 --> 01:08:46,919
is this is old don't look at this is we

1589
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:49,259
really way<font color="#E5E5E5"> old this is years years old</font>

1590
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,029
but it gives an example of how i would

1591
01:08:49,259 --> 01:08:53,670
do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a greater than less than greater</font>

1592
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:56,790
than nine less than or<font color="#CCCCCC"> equal to 20 right</font>

1593
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:59,190
as 11 style of doing doing the filtering

1594
01:08:56,790 --> 01:09:01,140
all right but you have to understand the

1595
01:08:59,189 --> 01:09:03,178
consequences of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so this</font>

1596
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:04,410
is a business<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision we thought about</font>

1597
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,489
protecting your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business as a part of</font>

1598
01:09:04,410 --> 01:09:08,160
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> business decision you have to think</font>

1599
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:10,379
too what's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for my business for this</font>

1600
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:12,389
right taking the more prefixes take up

1601
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:14,100
more memory<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right taking up more</font>

1602
01:09:12,390 --> 01:09:18,150
prefect smaller could take up you know

1603
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:19,509
you know turn time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

1604
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:21,158
maintenance overhead

1605
01:09:19,509 --> 01:09:24,549
it will cost me more money to<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain</font>

1606
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:27,368
this all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this filtering in</font>

1607
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:28,658
this way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to make make</font>

1608
01:09:27,368 --> 01:09:30,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure I check with the regional</font>

1609
01:09:28,658 --> 01:09:31,719
registries and what their allocations

1610
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:34,268
are because they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not static</font>

1611
01:09:31,719 --> 01:09:35,529
organizations each each of the regional

1612
01:09:34,269 --> 01:09:38,199
registries are doing their updates and

1613
01:09:35,529 --> 01:09:39,730
things like that there are holes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1614
01:09:38,198 --> 01:09:41,759
like for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance each of the regional</font>

1615
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:44,259
registries now have infrastructure

1616
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,929
allocations that they carve out for like

1617
01:09:44,259 --> 01:09:49,089
okay here's for exchange points here's

1618
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:52,589
for you know things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that right so</font>

1619
01:09:49,089 --> 01:09:55,690
there's things of how you would do that

1620
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:56,679
yeah its<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so you</font>

1621
01:09:55,690 --> 01:10:02,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to understand the consequences</font>

1622
01:09:56,679 --> 01:10:04,750
think through with it so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1623
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:06,098
second one where you were you know the

1624
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:09,429
strict mode where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm either loose</font>

1625
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:13,409
mode where you prevent 24 yes well okay

1626
01:10:09,429 --> 01:10:15,820
one point for kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> consequences I</font>

1627
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:18,690
think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a very good idea</font>

1628
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:21,429
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> who does such such a policy</font>

1629
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:24,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually should publish that he is using</font>

1630
01:10:21,429 --> 01:10:26,889
such policy so that parties that

1631
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:29,050
actually deliberately are just doing

1632
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:31,269
more specific announcements at least

1633
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:34,059
have some point they can be pointed to

1634
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:38,380
that well okay if they do it this way

1635
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:41,260
they will not be reachable right that

1636
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:42,880
would be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for the rest of</font>

1637
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:45,820
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you actually make a</font>

1638
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:47,230
choice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this and now why so I'll</font>

1639
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:49,239
give you a business reason why you want

1640
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:50,500
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> publish your policy so the business</font>

1641
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:54,308
reason why you're punished want to

1642
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:57,610
publish a policy as it saves you from

1643
01:10:54,309 --> 01:10:59,500
getting a phone call phone calls to your

1644
01:10:57,610 --> 01:11:02,500
NOC phone calls to you help desk<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

1645
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:05,050
money and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can publish a policy were</font>

1646
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:08,139
like somebody in Germany can find out

1647
01:11:05,050 --> 01:11:09,579
somebody in Singapore is got a

1648
01:11:08,139 --> 01:11:11,530
particular policy and they can look

1649
01:11:09,579 --> 01:11:13,239
online you know what the policy is then

1650
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:15,699
that person isn't going to call me they

1651
01:11:13,239 --> 01:11:17,169
will know what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

1652
01:11:15,699 --> 01:11:18,250
that's a business reason why you want to

1653
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:20,409
you know equating it back to the

1654
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:22,780
business there's good business reasons

1655
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:24,638
why I want to take you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like chose</font>

1656
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:26,139
choose down these paths and update my

1657
01:11:24,639 --> 01:11:27,639
policies done this is why you want to

1658
01:11:26,139 --> 01:11:31,210
make it public so everybody knows

1659
01:11:27,639 --> 01:11:33,330
exactly what you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and</font>

1660
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:35,730
again this is an example of

1661
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:37,740
you know everything's at 24 this is a

1662
01:11:35,730 --> 01:11:42,150
loose check so strict check loose check

1663
01:11:37,740 --> 01:11:44,490
two different modes with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom line</font>

1664
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:46,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this is its interests in one large</font>

1665
01:11:44,490 --> 01:11:47,670
our service provider who had to be

1666
01:11:46,020 --> 01:11:51,420
called was doing this technique during

1667
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:53,010
700 block 7707 and didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

1668
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:55,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was something going out out there</font>

1669
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:56,880
their routers were not affected lots of

1670
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:58,410
other service by Rizzo routers were

1671
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,150
affected this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular service</font>

1672
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:01,410
provider<font color="#CCCCCC"> that routers were not affected</font>

1673
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,969
at all because they were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1674
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:06,630
approach to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protecting themselves for</font>

1675
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:08,820
ingress prefex filtering all right what

1676
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:11,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened 7007 then that D aggregated</font>

1677
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:13,469
what did this network do<font color="#CCCCCC"> they filter</font>

1678
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:17,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the regional registry boundaries</font>

1679
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:18,780
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means all this D all this div ated</font>

1680
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:21,000
prefixes they hit their filters and

1681
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:23,580
their filters dropped it didn't touch

1682
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,470
your router's at all right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a</font>

1683
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:26,700
technique that some service lawyers will

1684
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:29,190
raise<font color="#E5E5E5"> your hand and say like eight it</font>

1685
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:31,230
saved us now they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> speaking as a</font>

1686
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:32,969
business remember this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> all going to</font>

1687
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:35,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the realm where this is all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ng n</font>

1688
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:36,900
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the why we</font>

1689
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,900
should be doing this filtering to

1690
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:42,629
protect our business<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so so it's a</font>

01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:44,879
proven tool and these templates both of

1692
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:47,220
the template Steve that I did we have in

1693
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,630
here I English prefix filter and strict

1694
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:50,300
mode loose mode there's actually two

1695
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:52,710
filters strict mode loose<font color="#E5E5E5"> boat</font>

1696
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:54,720
maintaining it and part of the reason I

1697
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:56,640
maintain it is all the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> regis</font>

1698
01:12:54,720 --> 01:13:01,020
regional registry allocations for the

1699
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:05,130
other templates in there saying again

1700
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:07,050
all right customers because if you

1704
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:16,320
easily have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario where here he is</font>

1705
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,730
why is he speaking bgp to you because

1706
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:19,980
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home he's either multi-home</font>

1707

1709
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:28,019
connection to somebody else right so he

1710
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:29,700
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know a policy with this</font>

1711
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular that block he should only</font>

1712
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:33,570
announce this to his peers she only

1713
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:35,820
accept him from his peers and then you

1714
01:13:33,570 --> 01:13:37,410
know you should have the strict in there

1715
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:39,240
but then you know customers will start

1716
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:41,370
coming up with excuses oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> man this is so</font>

1717
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:43,170
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain and it is hard to</font>

1718
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:45,930
maintain but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consequence is simple</font>

1719
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:46,980
and we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> flip forward here this is</font>

1720
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:49,050
the consequence

1721
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:52,860
and I've seen this happen so many times

1722
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:54,720
it's funny one of the wildest cases I

1723
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:58,519
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was working to sing over telecom</font>

1727
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:11,640
this I'm tres ravenous and it's going

1728
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:13,200
out to the University of Singapore from

1729
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:15,989

preventing seize private backbone of

Japan edges exit into Japan itself so

1736
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:34,470
here was basically a configuration

1737
01:14:31,970 --> 01:14:37,350
policy mistakes chain on top of each

1738

<font color="#CCCCCC">became my primary link into Japan</font>

1742
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:50,370
scratching my head why is this going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1743
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:53,010
right and why was this was going on was

1744
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:55,260
the filters are not set up properly in

1745
01:14:53,010 --> 01:14:57,360
multiple places my filters weren't set

1746
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:59,430
up properly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university filters won't</font>

1747
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,739
set up properly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Katy these filters are</font>

1748
01:14:59,430 --> 01:15:03,480
not set up properly right so it took a

1749
01:15:01,739 --> 01:15:05,849
day where we all had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through and</font>

1750
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:08,309
say you know we had all clean up or

1751
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:10,470
filters<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right because everybody's</font>

1752
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:13,200
filter was all messed up<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

1753
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:16,620
there's a case where I was the the you

1754
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:18,720
know one part of the chain of calamity

1755
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:20,940
of errors there that caused a and all

1756
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:22,710
the backbones go up there yeah he's got

1757
01:15:20,940 --> 01:15:24,599
a war story and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font>

1758
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:27,239
AAS pass filtering is not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

1759
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:29,670
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s pad filtering does nothing to</font>

1760
01:15:27,239 --> 01:15:31,379
prevent any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these problems a spam</font>

1761
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:33,560
filtering is very nice to solve certain

1762
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:38,670
certain types of problems but not this

1763
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:41,610
and it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely insufficient so it</font>

1764
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:43,290
should not be looked at as any as any

1765
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:45,089
kind of serious protection against addy

1766
01:15:43,290 --> 01:15:48,090
aggregation event or a hijack a bit

1767
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:49,380
right these<font color="#E5E5E5"> days when I set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1768
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:51,750
filtering policies why I'm actually

1769
01:15:49,380 --> 01:15:53,820
sitting down with a customer it's using

1770
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:55,739
a combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a prefix filter and</font>

1771
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,630
community filter<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> na s pass filter</font>

1772
01:15:55,739 --> 01:15:59,940
and each of them has their strengths

1773
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:01,140
each of them has a limitations

1774
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:03,179
and then you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work with them</font>

1775
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">together to actually reflect what your</font>

1776
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:07,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">filters and policy is and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times</font>

1777
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:10,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I right I help the customer sit down and</font>

1778
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:11,910
and force everybody to write down<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1779
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,739
English they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into configs a</font>

1780
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:16,800
lot of times and I said no no let's

1781
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:18,540
write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down let's write down policy</font>

1782
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,610
and what do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have happened and</font>

1783
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:22,350
then once we write down what we want to

1784
01:16:20,610 --> 01:16:24,960
have happen then we look at our three

1785
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:26,670
tools or prefix community and s path and

1786
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,160
we find out how do we express that

1787
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:31,050
policy now and a configuration so

1788
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:32,969
writing writing a policy down is

1789
01:16:31,050 --> 01:16:35,070
important because if you're dumped<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1790
01:16:32,969 --> 01:16:38,820
and says I'll just use I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a SPF</font>

1791
01:16:35,070 --> 01:16:40,650
belton for everything well it's a tool

1792
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:43,739
it only does certain certain things a

1793
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:45,960
tool in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your tool kit all right same</font>

1794
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:50,280
again prefix filtering to your peers

1795
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:52,290
right prefix filter is all LT appears

1796
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,059
this is going out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your peers you know</font>

1797
01:16:52,290 --> 01:16:55,440
certain things you should filter you

1798
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:56,910
know you don't want to send designate

1799

exchange point / / 24 this last 24

1899
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:38,269
shouldn't be advertised to the outside

world because it's an exchange point

1901
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:42,260
just for those members on the exchange

1902
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:46,219
point not for somebody on the other side

of the planet right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you shouldn't be</font>

and things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this from from their</font>

1929
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:42,290

a static route redistributed static and

1931
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:48,590
they accepted it but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you allow your</font>

the ones to your loop backs not the ones

1940
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:08,770
that you have allocated to customers

1941
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:08,770
that they can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> use for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming</font>

1942
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:19,639

1951
01:22:39,860 --> 01:22:45,290
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's a scenario here i am customer</font>

incident vector on the net is is that

1984
01:23:46,900 --> 01:23:52,009
preparation is really key I mean being

able to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple thing like having</font>

in the future to not have hijacks happen

2016
01:24:54,699 --> 01:24:58,659
but today hi Jax will happen tomorrow hi

2017

say well let me protect myself by<font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

aggregating every prefix I have right so

01:25:25,869 --> 01:25:30,670
is this really option you know the

2029
01:25:30,670 --> 01:25:35,650
they injected 25 you can eject it 5 25

2030
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:37,949
or 25 even work I don't know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

2031
01:25:35,650 --> 01:25:40,480
who has a better<font color="#CCCCCC"> aes path I don't know</font>

2032
01:25:37,949 --> 01:25:43,690
what about those networks that filter on

2033
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:45,308
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boundary all right you know there's</font>

2034
01:25:43,690 --> 01:25:46,839
all these questions about popping in

2035
01:25:45,309 --> 01:25:48,699
there with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with the hijack work so</font>

2036
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:50,380
work it through and then when you look

2037
01:25:48,699 --> 01:25:52,839
at it where do you do different things

2038
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">like so you got like down here and is</font>

2039
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:57,900
200 where the hijack is being<font color="#E5E5E5"> originated</font>

2040
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:00,550
maybe that autonomous system isn't

2041
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:01,960
cooperative but the up<font color="#E5E5E5"> strains from that</font>

2042
01:26:00,550 --> 01:26:04,750
autonomous system is there things that

2043
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:07,090
they can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> on their part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right don't</font>

2044
01:26:04,750 --> 01:26:10,210
know they may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared as we saw</font>

2045
01:26:07,090 --> 01:26:12,219
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case where Pakistan reach was not</font>

2046
01:26:10,210 --> 01:26:13,480
really prepared to do anything they were

2047
01:26:12,219 --> 01:26:15,489
going like what do we do whatever do and

2048
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:17,500
you didn't really think through what if

2049
01:26:15,489 --> 01:26:20,650
somebody hijacks a downstream from us

2050
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:22,900
what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do can we do a fit or drop</font>

2051
01:26:20,650 --> 01:26:26,650
in an ingress filter that filters<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

2052
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:29,619
prefix well they weren't doing any

2053
01:26:26,650 --> 01:26:30,790
ingress filtering on their peers so they

2054
01:26:29,619 --> 01:26:33,360
didn't have the ingress filter in place

2055
01:26:30,790 --> 01:26:35,800
so you know you run into these sort of

2056
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:38,490
you know what do you do at each point

2057
01:26:35,800 --> 01:26:40,450
and this is exercising

2058
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:42,219
organization should walk through with

2059
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:44,050
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say here's our network</font>

2060
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:46,720
map because I were connected let's do a

2061
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:51,310
tabletop exercise of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we work I</font>

2062
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:54,070
hijack all right because you know right

2063
01:26:51,310 --> 01:26:55,390
now there isn't a you know there isn't a

2064
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:56,370
big motivation for these hijacks that

2065
01:26:55,390 --> 01:26:58,690
happen so when they do happen

2066
01:26:56,370 --> 01:27:00,490
fortunately for us had been maintenance

2067
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:03,190
ejector trouble has been somebody who

2068
01:27:00,490 --> 01:27:04,900
did<font color="#E5E5E5"> something it messed up and then a</font>

2069
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:06,639
calamity of errors happen and it had a

2070
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:08,679
consequence on the net all right there

2071
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:10,960
hasn't been like intentional so speaking

2072
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:12,610
of which what happened well what

2073
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:16,510
happened was the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pakistan was</font>

2074
01:27:12,610 --> 01:27:18,370
upset with you to write and they did

2075
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:19,690
what's within their rights as a national

2076
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:21,610
government they say we're going to

2077
01:27:19,690 --> 01:27:22,960
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> our citizens to degree or we're</font>

2078
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:24,969
going to filter we're going to protect

2079
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:27,370
my stance in the government whatever you

2080
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:29,020
know national governments have authority

2081
01:27:27,370 --> 01:27:30,820
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> citizens injury to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

2082
01:27:29,020 --> 01:27:33,760
things and they put on<font color="#E5E5E5"> an order to the</font>

2083
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:36,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">telecom providers as a gold filter dis</font>

2084
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:38,440
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pakistan telecom is like the big</font>

2085
01:27:36,700 --> 01:27:40,900
choke point all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

2086
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:42,820
Pakistan telecom they decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what's</font>

2087
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:45,339
the quickest<font color="#CCCCCC"> way for us to execute this</font>

2088
01:27:42,820 --> 01:27:47,259
our order from the government so they go

2089
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:50,620
out there and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically say I'm</font>

2090
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:52,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to use a motor go black hole very</font>

2091
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:53,950
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> technique one of the most common</font>

2092
01:27:52,660 --> 01:27:55,690
techniques we use on a net today to

2093
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:57,190
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves for dos attacks and</font>

2094
01:27:55,690 --> 01:27:59,919
other activities so it's a well-known

2095
01:27:57,190 --> 01:28:02,139
technique very stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go</font>

2096
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:04,120
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and advertise whether it's the</font>

01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:05,770
black hole prefixes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube i'm</font>

2098
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:07,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send that into my into my</font>

2099
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:08,830
network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i go up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there and send it</font>

2100
01:28:07,630 --> 01:28:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">into my network and it gets propagated</font>

2101
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:15,309
out no problem government order executed

2102
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:17,080
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a problem they use</font>

2103
01:28:15,310 --> 01:28:21,400
community trigger black holes which is

2104
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:24,309
the common way that we all right they

2105
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:27,820
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in the export on it they</font>

2106
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:30,010
didn't have a egress filter right so

2107
01:28:27,820 --> 01:28:32,110
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the two things community filter</font>

2108
01:28:30,010 --> 01:28:34,150
in even in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our community specification</font>

2109
01:28:32,110 --> 01:28:36,639
we have a safeguard safeguard there's no

I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cobra egress veteran says don't send</font>

anything with these communities

2118
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:54,370
that would have protected it but there

2119
01:28:51,969 --> 01:28:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">was no egress filtering at all so it</font>

2120
01:28:54,370 --> 01:29:01,599
leaks out<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right then it gets to</font>

2121
01:28:56,980 --> 01:29:03,669
reach continues and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

2122
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:06,760
dynamics of this how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:10,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">have watched the video from wipe the</font>

2125
01:29:10,210 --> 01:29:13,780
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't put in</font>

2126
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:15,760
this section but in the beginning was

2127
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:17,259
talked about why we are here there's a

2128
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:20,050
URL at the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this so you can</font>

2129
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:22,270
pull down the slides go to that and

2130
01:29:20,050 --> 01:29:24,580
watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right it's it's the when</font>

2131
01:29:22,270 --> 01:29:27,460
people ask about what happened I point

2132
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:29,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that big write-up and there's some</font>

2133
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:31,600
really really cool tools developed there

2134
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:34,480
where you can analyze this stuff right

2135
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,310
and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> video on that tool set so</font>

2136
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,928
instead of looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the tools and</font>

2137
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:39,460
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with it watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the video</font>

2138
01:29:37,929 --> 01:29:42,699
first and it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressive and</font>

2139
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:44,020
that tool set is available to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

2140
01:29:42,699 --> 01:29:45,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so they will play everybody here</font>

2141
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:47,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that tool set and play around</font>

2142
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,480
with it that's a tool set is available

2143
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:51,429
to community<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for doing that sort of</font>

2144
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:53,919
analysis so I highly recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

2145
01:29:51,429 --> 01:29:55,389
watch that and then think through with

2146
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:57,340
this way the filters are supposed to

2147
01:29:55,389 --> 01:29:59,469
work and think through and watch this

2148
01:29:57,340 --> 01:30:02,199
tool because you can see prefix goes out

2149
01:29:59,469 --> 01:30:04,750
next next<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be next I has to be next</font>

session<font color="#CCCCCC"> summarized end up what we're</font>

2157
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:23,559
about is we look at that video kind of

2158
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:25,719
go like what could<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do to not be end up</font>

2159
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:27,429
in the same boat as YouTube what can I

2160
01:30:25,719 --> 01:30:29,679
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not end up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same boat as</font>

2161
01:30:27,429 --> 01:30:31,989

01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:39,900
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of us if we don't think through</font>

2163
01:30:31,989 --> 01:30:39,900
this sort of thing so anything else

2164
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:46,870
and are there any are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

2165
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:55,180
questions questions on practical

2166
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:56,530
implementations so you spoke at one

2167
01:30:55,180 --> 01:30:59,140
point of having a database<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

2168
01:30:56,530 --> 01:31:01,960
contained all your prefixes and all the

2169
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:03,670
customers prefixes and you talked about

2170
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:09,850
the route object and the route object

2171
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:12,190
has the prefix information in it what do

2172
01:31:09,850 --> 01:31:14,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to ensure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

2173
01:31:12,190 --> 01:31:17,710
correct information from the customer

2174
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:19,480
and where do you get the route objects

2175
01:31:17,710 --> 01:31:24,790
from and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that that</font>

2176
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:26,830
information is correct for the first

2177
01:31:24,790 --> 01:31:28,900
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that is is your own routes and</font>

2178
01:31:26,830 --> 01:31:30,670
and the presumption is that you know

2179
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:32,080
what is that all the ISPs know what know

2180
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:34,780
what their own infrastructure routes are

2181
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:36,550
directly out<font color="#E5E5E5"> things directly allocated</font>

2182
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:40,030
to them because that that can be assumed

2183
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:41,920
to be correct the barring fat fingered

2184
01:31:40,030 --> 01:31:44,040
stuff right good right but that on the

2185
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:47,560
state will turn up<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon or not quickly</font>

2186
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:49,930
then for custom for customers the

2187
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:51,970
easiest the easiest thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is have</font>

2188
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:53,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that validates this against</font>

2189
01:31:51,970 --> 01:31:55,510
what their prefix list is validate this

2190
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:58,929
against what they what they are known to

2191
01:31:55,510 --> 01:32:01,990
advertise and make this a step in

2192
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:03,490
building a prefix list that if it's not

2193
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:04,960
in the database it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it into</font>

2194
01:32:03,490 --> 01:32:06,670
the prefix list in and so they won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

2195
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:07,960
able to announce it so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have a</font>

2196
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:10,120
route that they're allowed to announce

2197
01:32:07,960 --> 01:32:12,700
but it would not actually be announced

2198
01:32:10,120 --> 01:32:14,320
until it gets into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database so so</font>

2199
01:32:12,700 --> 01:32:17,290
I'm actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to actually punt this</font>

2200
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:19,509
to the panel so this session is the

2201
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:21,910
tutorial we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> panel session on</font>

2202
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:22,930
Wednesday advertising the panel session

2203
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:24,790
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say that is</font>

2204
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:25,780
because in this area and saying I know

2205
01:32:24,790 --> 01:32:27,910
where you're going with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and run with</font>

2206
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:29,679
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the work in the IETF and with</font>

2207
01:32:27,910 --> 01:32:32,950
the registry work in the site or<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is</font>

2208
01:32:29,680 --> 01:32:37,810
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think and I wrote this note down</font>

2209
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:39,309
I think we're exposing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gap in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

2210
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:41,470
work we're carrying forward with it

2211
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:42,970
because there has to be and I'll bring

2212
01:32:41,470 --> 01:32:44,530
this up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go up to the mic and we'll</font>

2213
01:32:42,970 --> 01:32:47,650
bring this up good panel sort of

2214
01:32:44,530 --> 01:32:49,120
discussion there's a gap between if I am

2215
01:32:47,650 --> 01:32:52,719
a service provider I'm running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

2216
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:55,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">business all right how I</font>

2217
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:57,220
I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix and I have the</font>

2218
01:32:55,270 --> 01:32:59,740
authority to route it is a business

2219
01:32:57,220 --> 01:33:02,140
process and as a business process for a

2220
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:05,260
contractual arrangement I make with the

2221
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:06,670
customer and how I set that<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

2222
01:33:05,260 --> 01:33:08,920
process up to make that contractual

2223
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:12,880
arrangement with the customer I have to

2224
01:33:08,920 --> 01:33:14,350
find some way for the registry community

2225
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,030
where we can map that in because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

2226
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:18,910
already have problems in the community

2227
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:21,219
right now what we have businesses who

2228
01:33:18,910 --> 01:33:23,470
will accept anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> contract and</font>

2229
01:33:21,220 --> 01:33:26,770
they'll route anything per contract and

2230
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:29,070
then everybody in this room are a victim

2231
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:31,630
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that business contract process I</font>

2232
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:34,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking about the you know the</font>

2233
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:36,460
work that's going on you've talked about

2234
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:39,459
thurs part<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on I was just wondering</font>

2235
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:41,080
what do you do now what do you do about

2236
01:33:39,460 --> 01:33:43,840
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the information that</font>

2237
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:47,380
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting is correct don't think</font>

2238
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:51,010
anybody does much anything now my

2239
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:53,080
personal opinion different writers have

2240
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:54,940
different different policies on that and

2241
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,580
I've worked for<font color="#E5E5E5"> several providers who</font>

2242
01:33:54,940 --> 01:34:02,110
all had radically different policies the

2243
01:33:57,580 --> 01:34:04,630
in general if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're if if a customer</font>

2244
01:34:02,110 --> 01:34:06,759
is routing routing space that is given

2245
01:34:04,630 --> 01:34:08,380
to them by the organization itself well

2246
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:09,730
you have a record of that you have your

2247
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:11,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">own internal record and so you've</font>

2248
01:34:09,730 --> 01:34:12,849
created your own route object in your

2249
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:14,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">own server if they're if they want to</font>

01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:16,180
announce the space from their other

<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-home connection they can they can</font>

2252
01:34:16,180 --> 01:34:19,840
generally prove they can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a</font>

2253
01:34:18,370 --> 01:34:21,730
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is happening at the</font>

2254
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:23,050
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's turned up they may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

2255
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:24,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to document it further down the</font>

2256
01:34:23,050 --> 01:34:27,130
road but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can at least document it</font>

2257
01:34:24,430 --> 01:34:28,420
then and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so a lot of a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

2258
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:30,520
decisions and the database maintenance

2259
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:33,250
happens only at the time events of

2260
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:35,440
installation what the missing step is

2261
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:37,990
easy in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance of the records</font>

2262
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:40,780
that that to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that prefix lists</font>

2263
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:43,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get added to without route objects</font>

2264
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:45,790
being created yeah so in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

2265
01:34:43,210 --> 01:34:47,560
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a missing step in process and it</font>

2266
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:49,180
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be automated we can make it</font>

2267
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:51,190
automated so that the way you added at

2268
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:52,870
the prefix list is you update the record

2269
01:34:51,190 --> 01:34:56,080
is you update the route object and was

2270
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:59,860
about peering relationships that's a

2271
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:01,219
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a much tighter that's a much</font>

2272
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:04,670
funnier problem

2273
01:35:01,219 --> 01:35:07,219
but inherently if you're only in most

2274
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:09,979
peering relationships that I've seen

2275
01:35:07,219 --> 01:35:11,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally a provider is only exchanging</font>

2276
01:35:09,979 --> 01:35:12,679
the routes they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're</font>

2277
01:35:11,329 --> 01:35:14,299
directly connecting customers routes

2278
01:35:12,679 --> 01:35:16,340
yeah those are the ones that are

2279
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:18,079
generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> be happening a lot of these</font>

2280
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:19,579
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

2281
01:35:18,079 --> 01:35:22,509
there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a lot of peering</font>

2282
01:35:19,579 --> 01:35:25,999
relationships in the middle there that

2283
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:27,199
where they weren't doing but I work and

2284
01:35:25,999 --> 01:35:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were they were carried there were</font>

2285
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:30,428
people carrying things who are neither

2286
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:34,280
their customer nor their period right

2287
01:35:30,429 --> 01:35:45,309
well that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem so we're actually</font>

2288
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:49,070
short of time we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a break and then</font>

2289
01:35:45,309 --> 01:35:54,320
if we have time at the end of the the

2290
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:56,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">NSB sec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Boff is a bath in this room next</font>

2291
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:57,949

2292
01:35:56,630 --> 01:36:00,079
extra time there if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry on with</font>

2293
01:35:57,949 --> 01:36:02,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we also have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a panel</font>
