all right everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome back from</font>

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,110

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,549
talks now first up as Martin Brown with

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,400
Renesys and<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be talking</font>

5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:21,500
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to elrood in the</font>

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,500
past couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks so here's Martin</font>

7
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:28,260
thanks Igor hi thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> for coming back</font>

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,789
from lunch and listening in this talk we

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently found out something interesting</font>

10
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,440
about what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the l root</font>

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,719
server and that's what this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so</font>

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,899
it's we come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out with a couple of</font>

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,579
questions and we come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with some some</font>

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,489
potential recommendations or at least

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:47,879
thoughts about how how we could address

16
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,468
<font color="#CCCCCC">the issue so let's get started we</font>

17
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,510
probably everybody in this room knows

18
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,370
the importance of the root servers there

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:57,329
are 13 of them 13 root server IP

20
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,680
addresses there are about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 160 some of</font>

21
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,300
some other people in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> room may know</font>

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,860
the exact number today but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,780
160 actual physical servers that provide

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,429
these answers but there are 13 addresses

25
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,920
the prefixes in which those addresses

26
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:16,560
live are any casted so the back in 97 or

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,330
so in order to accommodate a larger

28
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,520
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of root nameservers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

29
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,990
response packet which can only be 512

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:27,810
bytes we we collectively renamed all of

31
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,630
the servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a b c d all the way up</font>

32
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,280
through em so that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 13 root</font>

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,280
server ip's because that's what fits in

34
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,549
the response response packet l root is

35

use until about<font color="#E5E5E5"> May second on November</font>

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,799
first and actually prior to that they

40
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,040
had announced it I can brought up a new

41
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,570
root server IP on which<font color="#E5E5E5"> l root was going</font>

to be providing answers<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly</font>

43
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,239
essentially l root was moving from the

44
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:13,230
old IP to the new IP so for the

45
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">following six months I can actually ran</font>

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,190
on the 198 IP and the 199 IP and then on

47
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:24,090
my second they turned it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off in the</font>

they stopped advertising the prefix and

59
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:01,590
somebody thought hey well why don't we

60
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a query to the l root server and</font>

61
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,910
see if it answers it answered that's not

62
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:10,379
what was supposed to happen that's when

63
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:12,299
we got involved they called us and said

64
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:14,370
hey can you tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us what's going on why</font>

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:16,680
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that this how is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it that this</font>

network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still routed and we went back</font>

67
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,030
and we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking and we found well</font>

68
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,929
just a moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show you the graph of</font>

69
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:27,480
what we found in response once we became

70
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:30,000
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can put some pressure on the</font>

unauthorized l root server operators to

turn them off by May sixteenth they were

all turned off this is the graph of what

74

it looks like hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue is is</font>

75
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:41,340

<font color="#E5E5E5">own root server well let's see we know</font>

118
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:47,599
what we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what bind does when it</font>

119
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,550
starts up one of the first things it

120
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:51,169
does it picks one of the root server

121
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,120
isn't it queer reason it gets the

122
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,919
current list from from the root server

123
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's picked it gets the current list of</font>

125
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:05,840
the root hints on a running instance of

126
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:09,349
bind you can hand back a response that

<font color="#E5E5E5">says I'm all the root</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name servers okay</font>

128
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:14,449
well you can also provide updated NS

129
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,560
records for all tlds what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean</font>

130
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:21,229
well that means instead of sending a

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:24,349
delegation instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending to the TL</font>

keep asking you for each you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> perform</font>

00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:06,410
the fragility of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 IP addresses</font>

and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for abuse so we</font>

149
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:11,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought about this some and we have some</font>

this is obviously just the first stuff

152
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,770
that came to our<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind so you can check</font>

00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:29,990

we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about a small number of</font>

which a root server lives that are

originated so you can you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

167
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,719
and we've identified the origination

168
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,940
pattern currently for all of these we've

169
00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:00,740
identified that on the blog you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use</font>

170
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,440
that as a filter these are pretty key

171
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,370
addresses it's 13 filters that's one

172
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,569
possibility you can also have a small

173
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:14,780
job internally that Ron's checks your

174
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:16,430
queries your own name server and asks it

175
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:18,559
for what it thinks the root hints are

176
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,479
and do a diff against a known unknown

177
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,740
set that'll tell you when something

178

you had your list of whatever but the

203
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:57,130
likely and our concern is actually to

204
00:09:52,790 --> 00:10:01,040
find some<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to codify that process and</font>

provide tools for audit trail and making

209
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,410
observation on your your comment that

210
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:17,569
people can build filters by looking at

211
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">current origination patterns for the</font>

212
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:23,180
roots and for a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the anycast</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roots</font>

213
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,040
there's new instances being turned up

214
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,560
frequently in New peering sessions being

215
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,630
turned out pretty frequently so even

216
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,280
those legitimate paths are likely to

217
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,290
change a fair amount well the path

218
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're quite correct the upstream</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> path</font>

219
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:38,030
may change but what we have seen is that

220
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,000
the origination pattern changes very

221
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:43,970
infrequently so by origination pattern

222
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,740
you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes and prefix the origin the</font>

independent / 24 is that don't appear to

237
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:21,829
have much else in them so it seems like

238
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,900
at this point it would be possible for

00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:00,290
certainly be monitoring for this you

283
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:01,190
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of activity and you know</font>

284
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,959
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are a hundred questions</font>

285
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:04,610
you could ask around this and you hit

286
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,350
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those and things like or</font>

287
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">geneious and even path monitoring and</font>

288
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:09,980
those in prefixes and dedicated you know

289
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">dedicated IP space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's a</font>

290
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,600
zillion things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that you know</font>

291
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,130
RS sac which is under I can and

292
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,480
I know the route operators group should

293
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,550
definitely be saying something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

294
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:21,170
this and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in stepping up and</font>

295
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">adding some transparency and</font>

296
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:23,810
accountability because the fact that

297
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,910
this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen with the root name</font>

298
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,800
server to me is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I mean</font>

299
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:29,480
it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> illustrates further I mean the</font>

300
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,639
fact that malware today you know always

301
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,230
compromises resolution pass so people

302
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:34,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">can own any of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those hosts anyone the</font>

303
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:36,380
queries this we now own every one of

304
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,000
these hosts or you know for fishing or

305
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,170
whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you want to do but you</font>

306
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,220

307
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,449
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting in this room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're</font>

308
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">not real concerned with this and</font>

309
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,959
pressing I can or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root operators</font>

310
00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:46,279
then you probably should be thinking a

311
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,209
lot about that because this is a really

312
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:53,019
big deal Thank you Thank You<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marty</font>
