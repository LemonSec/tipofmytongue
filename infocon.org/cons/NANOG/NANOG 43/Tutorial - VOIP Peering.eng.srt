00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,940
speak today we'll be talking about voice

appearing but before we begin talking

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,000
about that will first talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's</font>

8

happening within the communications

industry because of IP we're started

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:24,900
seeing a lot of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> vertical</font>

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,750
industries such as telecom web and media

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,369
coming together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're in essence</font>

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,800
competing with one another for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

14
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:33,540
types of customers so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">look at telecom you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to see</font>

18
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,270

19
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,000
such as Google slowly starting to offer

20
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:46,620
telecom related services embedded within

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">of web applications and if you look at</font>

media if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Disney and ESPN</font>

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,010
they start rolling out telecom related

24
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,980
services like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Disney's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MVNO like</font>

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,989
services somewhere between the intersect

26
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,180
between web telecom and media is

27
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:04,229
creating that new new communications

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:06,450
industry which is yet to be defined so

29
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,340
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all possible due to IP</font>

30
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,500
technology service creation has really

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,570
shifted towards to control of the

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,270
general public<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you no longer locked</font>

33
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,189
into vendors in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having them</font>

34
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,590
control what services you can

35
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,689
potentially offer and this allows any IT

36
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,619
professional to develop new services

37
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:28,020
quickly and rapidly so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick glimpse</font>

38
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,960
of was how the PSTN kind of functions

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,390
today when a user initiates a call one

40
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,548
end to another that calls transversing

41
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,500
the tedium portion of the network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

42
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:39,360
hits and offices in tandem switches

43
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,159
throughout the network along that way

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,130
there's an ss7 Eric as to someone is

45
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:46,799
responsible for setting up that call and

46
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,570
turned on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that call it also connects</font>

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,930
different types of databases such as

48
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,750
seen em LMP lid<font color="#CCCCCC"> b</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is f and so forth and</font>

49
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,820
these databases are required in order to

50
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,380
be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a call so for example LMP</font>

51
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,600
contains information where that number

52
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">has been ported to in terms of what care</font>

53
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,240
and how

54
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs rerouted while on the other hand</font>

55
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,979
the CNM database is responsible for

56
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,250
storing the first and last name you know

57
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:13,860
of a subscriber with introduction of

58
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">wastes r.i.p what what the initial Bush</font>

59
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,840
IP cares are doing the early 90s was to

60
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,640
replace the tandem or the IHC function

61
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,740
by routing calls from one local market

62
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,440
to another local market directly using

63
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,180
IP in the middle so a classic example of

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,250
that is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be I basis you know</font>

65
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is a fairly large player around</font>

66
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,940
the world and they basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> can pick up</font>

67
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,790
a call from North America and router

68
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,020
over IP to some local country and the

69
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,380
premise behind that is to terminate

70
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:43,320
calls at lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last five</font>

71
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,880
to six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years you start to see the</font>

72
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,530
emergence of vonage like companies

73
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,810
vonage into phone and pack a date and

74
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,850
what they decided to do was instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

75
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,310
functioning as an IHC provider why not

76
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:56,040
deliver voice services to the consumer

77
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,570
directly over IP so in this architecture

78
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,220
the pickup subscribers off the public

79
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet rata to their sip proxy or</font>

80
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,510
session border controller and they

81
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,770
convert that coal from IP to TDM using

82
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,780
these media gateways which then

83
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,750
interface to the PSTN and nessa<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seven</font>

security functionality we'll be talking

89
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,690
more about this where the

90
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,489
telecommunication entry is heading

91
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:26,070
towards is mashups and service delivery

92
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:28,410
platforms mesh ups are just like you

93
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,609
know if ever use<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube and you upload</font>

94
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,010
a video into it you'll notice that

95
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">youtube has a way you can embed a</font>

97
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,600
website and so what voice mashup

98
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:38,910
companies are doing is you can actually

99
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,709
you know copy a couple lines of code put

100
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,480
it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto your site and now you have</font>

101
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,410
instant voice functionality like click

102
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,518
to call as a class you know an excellent

103
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,170
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> dulu your platforms is where all</font>

104
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,430
the telcos are heading towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

105
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,708
this is in essence middle of our

106
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,510
software so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take a look at some of</font>

107
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:56,580
these companies let's take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vox</font>

list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your available d ID numbers</font>

118
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,290
and you know and what's the capacity in

119
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,570
so far to get these different parameters

120
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:24,360
and I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> purchase those numbers on the</font>

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,950
fly using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API and now once i get the</font>

122
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,470

complex to make this issue even more

143
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,840
complex a lot of the major carriers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

early in the transition to move to

IP to TDM to IP to TDM to IP and so

149
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,660
forth a lot of replicated conversions in

150
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,160
the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's a very costly you</font>

151
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,520
know in terms of moon calls now through

152
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,860
the PSTN and when your when your calls

153
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,270
initiatives IP you have very advanced

154
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,180
features like for example you could have

155
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,530
HD codecs or sip video as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

156
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,000
wrote them through the PSTN you're

157
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,200
losing that functionality because the

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,970
PSTN only carries voice so we're aiming

159
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,010
towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> moon</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to environment of our calls</font>

160
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:52,530
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> around complete IP IP without</font>

161
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:54,990
ever having to<font color="#CCCCCC"> touch the PSTN or its ss7</font>

162
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">elements and so the goal is when you</font>

163
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,660
initiate a call you want to be able to

164
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,909
route in a peer-to-peer fashion just

165
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">like how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have email</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today i can send</font>

166
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:02,940
email<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly from my mail server to</font>

167
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,590
your mail server without going through

168
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,080
any middle people or brokers and so

169
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:08,849
forth and so the goal behind that is

170
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,260
again to reduce costs you want enable

171
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,530
advanced services like telepresence

172
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,820
video HD calling and so forth or any new

173
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:17,130
technology gets introduced you want to

174
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,840
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly support that and the</font>

175
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,070
goal behind peering also is you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

176
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,080
reduce time-to-market time to revenue

177
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,140
for a lot of carers today when they

178
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,320
savage I voice<font color="#CCCCCC"> interconnects especially</font>

179
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,360
through TDM connection

180
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,150
you have that provisioning interval so

181
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,560
if you have new applications that you

182
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,700
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> develop we need to handle large</font>

183
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,870
amounts that call volume like for

184
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,450
example if its political political

185
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,090
calling or if you have American Idol

186
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,099
like applications very difficult you

187
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">know to scale in that in the in the</font>

188
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,910
tedium sense when you're an IP if you

189
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:47,380
have a gig e or<font color="#CCCCCC"> tinggi interconnect you</font>

192
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,850
the presentation will be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

196
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,630
voice over IP traffic just like IP

197
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,180
peering voice appearing has bilateral

198
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,830
period typically government by

199
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,470
commercial agreements so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two</font>

200
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,400
kerosene hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can route calls to + 44</font>

201
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,630
UK and i'll send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you calls to plus</font>

one-fourth<font color="#E5E5E5"> america and here's our route</font>

203
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:20,380
table and dial plants you know will

204
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,640
charge you this much and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll be</font>

205
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:23,320
willing to pay this much you know when

206
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,450
you send me<font color="#E5E5E5"> tryouts and me traffic and</font>

207
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,880
so forth and multilateral peering just

208
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,099
like I preparing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cinder keeps all type</font>

209
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,260
model appendage really all peers or up

210
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:33,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">here where they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dump here so usually</font>

211
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's part of like a collective group</font>

212
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,750
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> annex an example is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

213
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">about this is the cable MSO they want to</font>

214
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:40,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">get together and create a group where</font>

215
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:43,240
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> msos</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computer with one another</font>

216
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:47,020
directly for free and this is emerging

217
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:51,010
right now within the voice industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

218
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:53,169
so in terms of transport you know for

219
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:55,570
appearing voice traffic obviously the

220
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,850
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

221
00:07:55,570 --> 00:08:01,180
denominator there we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

222
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,220
slowly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a voice in terms of being changed</font>

223
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,990
over internet exchange points there's

224
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,700
special purpose built appearing power

225
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,100
firms you know distribute it exchanges

226
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:13,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> carry boys traffic and now is a</font>

227
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,040
private interconnects<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in terms of</font>

228
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:17,110
hearing architectures<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be talking</font>

229
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">about different methods so the first is</font>

230
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:21,910
going to be intra domain so we work with

231
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,780
a lot of carers out initiate so it's

232
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,370
kind of interesting you would just

233
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,900
suspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a lot of mobile operators</font>

234
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:28,000
would have actual networks tying all

235
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:31,090
that local markets so in this particular

236
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,799
instance this mobile carrier when is it

237
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,689
when a subscriber makes a call from a

238
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,549
New York customer to a San Francisco

239
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:39,520
customer as an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that call is</font>

240
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:41,409
actually being transferred over the PSTN

241
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,640
the first goal behind carriers

242
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:44,319
implanting we're appearing is they want

243
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,270
to keep all traffic between all the

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,980
subscribers on that and all different

245
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,439
markets<font color="#E5E5E5"> within whether it's the United</font>

246
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,970
States or weathers between countries or

247
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,460
weathers between different divisions

248
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,050
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> excellent example is a couple</font>

249
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">months ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a large operator here in</font>

250
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:59,770
North America just implemented enum now

251
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,180
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to route traffic between the</font>

252
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,579
mobil group the wholesale group the

253
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,859
retail group and other related

254
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,190
affiliates and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again the goal is to</font>

255
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">in essence perform a toll bypass so you</font>

256
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,070
know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm moving calls over the old</font>

257
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,470
network in comparison to routing it over

258
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,510
the PSTN the issue with rowing calls

259
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,940
over the PSTN aside from losing features

260
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,530
is you get hit on a permanent basis and

261
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,900
the second a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people may not</font>

262
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:24,670
realize is there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ssl look up costs and</font>

263
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,050
yet to pay on the Prairie base and

264
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:28,060
you're from a fraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a penny up to</font>

265
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:29,469
a couple cents and that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> add up to</font>

266
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,000
millions of dollars for routing calls

267
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:33,000
just alone and look up charges

268
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:42,350
the next architecture is<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter-domain</font>

269
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,660
routing this is where it really get

270
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:46,400
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> number one up here these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are two</font>

271
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,930
clx they want to interconnect together

272
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,100
this is bilateral peering typically

273
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:51,380
they'll have some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of commercial</font>

274
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,910
agreement and what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing over</font>

275
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,100
here is they're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay any traffic</font>

276
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:56,810
coming into this rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> center I'll take</font>

277
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">and any traffic going to your rate</font>

278
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:01,369
center I'll send you and then the other

279
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,620
type of model is obviously a transiting

280
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,780
model just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like IP transit you have a</font>

281
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,940
number care selling voice transit or

282
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,520
they call it voice termination to be

283
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,410
more precise and the advantage with this

284
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,850
is obviously if you don't connect

285
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,140
directly to a lot of local markets you

286
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,120
can transit through this particular care

287
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,160
the issue with<font color="#CCCCCC"> these two models right</font>

288
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">now in the voice world is it's based on</font>

289
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,480
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> apes routing so the way a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

290
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,000
care is around today as<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i want to</font>

291
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,670
say plus 1 2 & 2 which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> near I want to</font>

325
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:38,180
all these routes so they basically

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,530
upload their route table all the

00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,829
we're heading there right now issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

355
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,610
clearing houses is they charge

00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:35,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">Commission's so they charge your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">commission on the x and they charge your</font>

358
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:39,209
commission on the sell side and some of

359
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,360
the clearing houses also charge some

360
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:45,579
what we call this credit risk insurance

361
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,870
you know which is another fee and Nick

362
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,760
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time you add up it could</font>

363
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,190
range anywhere from five percent to

364
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,660
twelve percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> on average in the voice</font>

00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:54,399
wholesale industry they're working in

366
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,920
margins are typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in single digits</font>

367
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,010
so clearing houses are very expensive

368
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in their in their business the other</font>

369
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,640
issue also with this architecture is

370
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,250
occurring houses proxying all signaling

371
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,540
and RTP traffic so you're unable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

372
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,820
a true Peter Peter type of architecture

373
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,560
so just like cover in this room today we

374
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,600
can all speak<font color="#E5E5E5"> English today and tomorrow</font>

375
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,399
if i want to speak japanese or some

376
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,540
language as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can support it</font>

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,820
the other hand if there was someone in

380
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:23,649
between you and us that person has to

381
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,630
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same language otherwise you</font>

384
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,220
architecture is definitely crucial in

00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,600
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that's the model of the internet</font>

00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,670
in essence what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're using is the</font>

also and it maps telephone numbers to

you our eyes or IP addresses so when

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:28,100
assignments you know was X Y or Z but

440
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:30,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">after the 96 telecom act they introduced</font>

441
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,819
pooling resources and ported numbers so

442
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,470
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened is every time a new see</font>

443
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,759
like it came into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local market they</font>

444
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,009
want to have to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a whole entire</font>

445
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,660
new CEO code you know blocked or 10,000

446
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:42,170
numbers that would have exhausted the

447
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,639
entire number space in the PSTN so what

448
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:45,380
they allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with what they start</font>

449
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing is you started saying a thousand</font>

450
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,709
block numbers and you can also start

451
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,009
putting numbers from one care to another

452
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:53,809
care on a one-off basis so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers</font>

453
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:56,449
now be very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure din the impact database</font>

454
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:58,850
or that number portability database so

455
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:00,740
now whenever you initiate a call before

456
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you start running on your prefix based</font>

457
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:07,339
routing you had to launch a query to the

458
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,980
LMP database and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LMP database in an</font>

459
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:12,259
essence will return back in lr n<font color="#E5E5E5"> lrn is</font>

460
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,730
kind of like a location<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID where you</font>

461
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:14,860
brought that call to on the PS and

462
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:17,170
usually the idea

463
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,330
switch you know in some central office

464
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,709
so routing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. is quite difficult</font>

465
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,470
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any of the country just</font>

466
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,150
because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LMP type system there's</font>

467
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">over a hundred fifty thousand records</font>

468
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,260
and you also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to distinguish between</font>

469
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:31,510
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> bacchanal mailbox so for example if</font>

470
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:33,370
you wrote a call<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and 2 to 3 223</font>

471
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">witches or office number so you know</font>

472
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,100
where that's going to go to you have to

473
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,570
check if the numbers been ported or not

474
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,670
and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check whether</font>

475
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,780
that's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> R bakaan non-arabic number and</font>

476
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,250
there might be some other types of

477
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:46,120
categories too because your rates differ

478
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:48,310
to make that issue even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex if</font>

479
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,260
they call originated terminating in the

480
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:51,849
same state that's one rate if they call

481
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,980
originated from once they enter me

482
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,570
another state that's another rate and so

483
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,300
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check the calling number</font>

484
00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,550
that initiate the call to determine what

485
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:03,430
LCR record that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply to</font>

486
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:05,260
because of the cost differences and that

487
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:07,050
costs can vary by almost a thousand

488
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent intra and inter state routing</font>

489
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:13,180
and if you have calls are coming in from

490
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:15,280
overseas that's non jurisdiction that's

491
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,660
also handled separately<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and cares</font>

492
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,649
have a different set of pricing for that

493
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,630
we're the entire industries heading

494
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,790
towards is enum enum and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in essence will</font>

00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,250
map full<font color="#CCCCCC"> tulfo numbers ten digit 15</font>

it to a sip HT endpoint email addresses

499
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,140
HTTP is pretty much endless they can

500
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">support a wide range of addressing</font>

501
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,610
formats<font color="#E5E5E5"> the call flow for this is when a</font>

502
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,620
user initiates a call it hits the

503

carrier<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network that carrier</font>

505
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:48,520
DNS or enum curry to the dns server the

506
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,680
enum servers can return back to any PTR

507
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,180
records looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a URL string and some</font>

508
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,050
are the parameters and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll give</font>

509
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,950
instructions where you can write that

510
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:58,330
call to directly so in this example you

511
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,830
know care one's going to on CH a query

512
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,720
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> athan from each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mac and he can</font>

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,159
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the IP domain whether</font>

515
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,760
public in it or some sort of switching

516
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,250
fabric directly to the other end that

517
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,170
call now is moved I<font color="#CCCCCC"> pdi-p and to end</font>

518
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:13,120
without ever having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to touch the PSTN</font>

519
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:14,800
and through this architecture you don't

520
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,290
have to launch SSM queries or you

521
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,270
inquiry the LMP<font color="#E5E5E5"> Davies because enum</font>

522
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,389
contains the exact information right

523
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,940
about that call to in the IP sense so

524
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:25,720
you can also use<font color="#E5E5E5"> enum to do pile a'dope</font>

525
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,420
earring

526
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">go about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that with with enum since it's</font>

527
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,170
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server is very flexible so you can</font>

528
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:34,570
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> different types of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS views if</font>

529
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,950
you will you can also have dns servers

530
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,270
in each of the care environment so if

531
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:38,650
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vial of relationship you can</font>

532
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,000
set up an internal policy saying hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

533
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,860

534
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,530
first and then I'm gonna launch a query

535
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,060
to my bilateral peering partner and if

536
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,800
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> fails and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> launch these other</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the presentation I've talked about the</font>

are the types of databases and and so

542
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,850
one example is the CNM so whenever you

543
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:02,740
receive a call you have to query the

and Senators in the PSTN because

553
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,169
theoretically the PSTN doesn't recognize

554
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,690
those white carriage because they're not

555
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,070

558
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,740
with Allah thenahms you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> map</font>

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,960
this example receives a call they can

562
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:39,490
let another query back into the univ

563
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,770

that enum has also been used in the

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,030
mobile space actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's hot mms and</font>

566
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,100

572
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:02,050

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:08,380
you're adding dots between the digits

00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,370
the session border controls also perform

657
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,779
transcoding so if you need to convert

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,479
from one codec to another codec for

of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices if most carriers may</font>

691
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:10,010
have dozens to hundreds of these

00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:12,529
deployed all around your network and

693
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:14,120
neck is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex because you're you</font>

694
00:24:12,529 --> 00:24:15,500

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:22,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and once you get those rate changes in</font>

699
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,689
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put them into your</font>

700

application calculate who is the best

701
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,990
routes and you had to push all that

702
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:28,490
running information to all your border

703

elements you know which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> marked be</font>

704
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,690
over here and that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very complex task</font>

705
00:24:30,649 --> 00:24:34,189
especially when you have 150,000 routes

706
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:38,149
that have to be recalculated and we

707
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:40,480
propagate it out so what's what a lot of

708
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:42,439
SBC manufacturers have started doing is

709
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,179
instead of locating<font color="#E5E5E5"> borrowing</font>

710
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,620
intelligence right on the SBC they're

711
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:47,990
actually decentralizing out there

712
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,668
ripping it out and and now they have

713
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:51,740
these separate routing applications that

714
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:54,500
can be centralized in your network so

715
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,510
when a call comes in to SBC the SVC then

716
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,889
will in essence launch crate to their

717
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,400

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">all as telecom companies move into the</font>

727
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,810
IP domain to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to route calls IP</font>

728
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:25,760
IP there's no central authority at the

729
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:27,860
moment that that tells you right about

730
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the calls to so like in the PSTN you</font>

731
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,850
have new store<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you have telcordia</font>

732
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,679
respectively that control all the number

733
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,870
allocations and mapping and assignments

734
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,820
when you move into the IPL they don't

735
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">really apply you know in that sensitive</font>

736
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,919
right now they have initiatives underway

737
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,750
to add IP address information inside the

738
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">LMP Davies and the lower Gary's and so</font>

739
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,000
forth and I guess that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> subject to</font>

740
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,060
approval and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

741
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,070
unibytes members so on the internet or

742
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,240
not an internet but at least an IP world

743
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a wide range of companies</font>

744
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,390
offering peering services like the voice

746
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:04,790
verisign and others so each of these

747
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,680
enum systems are all separate they're

748
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,840
not interconnected together so this

749
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:11,420
poses a problem for a lot of telecom

750
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,399
companies so now they have to look up in

751
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,640
multiple NM databases to figure if they

752
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:17,660
can write that call IP so the border

753
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,030
elements need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support</font>

754
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">multiple enum lookups and what's crucial</font>

755
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,570
also is when you when you want to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

756
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,130
query to an enum database it's not like

757
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,320
the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it we can query and get</font>

758
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,850
the information where it's free a lot of

759
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">these enum davis's do charge you for</font>

760
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,820
every time you look up a number and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

761
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:34,669
meet you in charge you if you can make

762
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">that call successfully so when you</font>

763
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:38,210
launch queries you want to be able to

764
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:39,380
create groups and create a hierarchical

765
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:41,300
structure so you want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

766
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,700
route calls to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ino systems I don't</font>

767
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:46,129
charge anything first and if those fell

768
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,510
then I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> launch queries to my next</font>

769
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:50,780
set of enum servers and that could be

770
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,730
even parallel or in sequence so as an

771
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,840
example if you have 10 free enum servers

772
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:55,490
you can query<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't cost you</font>

773
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,470
anything you want to launch 10 queries

774
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,600
in parallel and that's essentially you

775
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:02,980
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting for a response this is an</font>

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">effort to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reduce call setup times</font>

777
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:09,530
here's an example of a voice message up

778
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,510
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> y spiritual important to them so</font>

779
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,980
in this example this voice messed up

780
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:14,990
company they require<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number services</font>

781
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:18,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">for one services they need to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

782
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:19,970
to their as a mms SMS provider for

783
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:22,940
setting up messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mobile</font>

784
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,170
subscribers and they need PSTN services

785
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,560
they need telephone numbers for inbound

786
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:29,540
services and any termination capability

787
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,310
the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these organizations have</font>

788
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,680
is they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> two Persian TDM circuits</font>

789
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:36,710
they need to purchase media gateways

790
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:39,080
that convert their IP calls and convert

791
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:41,210
them to TDM to send it out to their

792
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,620
various partners and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

793
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,660
this issue with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this model</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very</font>

794
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:46,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to scale and meet you</font>

795
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,920
know customer needs so when they move

796
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,540
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP domain they can eliminate the</font>

797
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,130
need of all those media gateways now

798
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,510
they can build sip interconnects you

799
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,250
know or HTTP connection whatever it

800
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,510
might be with the various partners the

801
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,410
interconnector so this allows them to

802
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly reduce time-to-market</font>

803
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,840
temperature revenue and they can scale

804
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,250
the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rapidly and this is in</font>

805
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,480
essence is called trunking or sip

806
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,360
trunking you may have heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> term</font>

807
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,950
sip trunking VoIP hearing voice kinda

808
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,959
it's all under the same rivela per se

809
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:13,010
it's all about interconnection you want

810
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,900
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interconnect your voice to</font>

811
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,280
work together in an IP environment so it

812
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,990
usually encompasses route discovery

813
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,050
transport and a wide range of other

814
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,730
things multilateral<font color="#E5E5E5"> preparing so we</font>

815
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:25,580
talked about the cable<font color="#CCCCCC"> labs MSO</font>

816
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:27,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">CableLabs RFP that they should last year</font>

817
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,060
and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind that is you have</font>

818
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">all these mo serves all around the</font>

00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:33,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">United States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a probability</font>

820
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:36,680
that these<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSO's are sending calls you</font>

821
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,880
know between their subscribers so they

822
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,990
already have interconnect agreements

823
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,910
between each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other through private</font>

824
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,860
interconnects or at public<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

825
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:44,840
peering points all they need to do is

826
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,909
now have a central<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the enum or sip</font>

827

828
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,900
numbers of all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSO's so now when an</font>

829
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,060
MSO receives a call from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subscriber</font>

830
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,460
before they send I before they start

831
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,200
saying they call to the LCR or the SSF

832
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,850
narcan free hot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that call they'll</font>

833
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,220
prepend it all in the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey I</font>

834
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:03,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to launch a query to the MSO enum</font>

835
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:04,670
server and if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers in there that</font>

836
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,890
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to route it directly over IP</font>

837
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so for them they're limiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SSM</font>

838
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:11,180
look up costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're limiting PSTN</font>

839
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,620
costs and they're reducing the amount of

840
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">capacity needed on their TDM</font>

841
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,510
infrastructure

842
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:18,750
that voice call that one of otherwise

843
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:20,490
you know went on and used up that

844
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,660
capacity so now they can free up

845
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,690
capacity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the team up for other</font>

846
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:26,400
revenue generation applications and so

847
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">now once calls move into an IP</font>

848
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,920
environment now they can do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

849
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,330
creative stuff so they already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

850
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">these advanced set-top boxes to home</font>

851
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:34,590
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can i enable them put voice on them</font>

852
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,760
so when a call comes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> UT because I hey</font>

853
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,870
there's an incoming call from this

854
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,700
subscriber so they can do some pretty

855
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:42,899
neat stuff now once the calls move

856
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:44,970
complete I<font color="#E5E5E5"> pdi-p yr wholesale carriers</font>

857
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,220
you know tier 1 tier 2 opera is so

858
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,290
interested in peering they want to use

859
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,090
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start limiting TDM by not</font>

860
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,340
appearing and move to IP bilateral

861
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:55,080
appearing when I mean what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

862
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,679
that is demonstrating their calls VoIP

863
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,480
and to end so in this example in the

864
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,810
voice initiate there's tons of resellers

865
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,870
maybe over half the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carriers out there</font>

866
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:08,460
are reselling one another so once you

867
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:10,080
move<font color="#CCCCCC"> into an IP environment they can now</font>

868
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,930
say they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go direct it to other</font>

869
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,280
carriers and and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is my</font>

877
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,200
doing is in it so what they're doing is

878
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,670
they're limiting the IHC so incessantly

879
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">I see at a lower rate they can sell a</font>

880
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:36,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit higher rate below the rate of</font>

881
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">IHC sells to the actual end customer so</font>

882
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:41,730
they're actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> reducing your operating</font>

883
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and increasing the margins so and</font>

884
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again that's really key especially</font>

885
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:48,890
where the wholesale<font color="#CCCCCC"> by Sergio have it</font>

886
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,890
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single digit margins</font>

887
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:56,159
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next part we're gonna be talking</font>

888
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,720
about is some of the initiatives in the

889
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,500
industry about in terms of hearing

890
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,500
solutions and services

891
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:16,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enum a lot</font>

892
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,570
originally when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Edom was developed back</font>

893
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:21,300
in two thousand approximately it was

894
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:23,129
designed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a user or a public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enum</font>

895
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,980
system it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was just to be embedded in the</font>

896
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,660
internet DNS architecture under the UNCC

897
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,770
photo ARPA and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

898
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,320
countries around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I</font>

899
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">already have delegations in the internet</font>

900
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:35,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS servers and I think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is in</font>

901
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,580
the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very political climate</font>

902
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,500
right now the use of these enum servers

903
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,730
you know on the public internet they

904
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,640
have a little bit different application

905
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,350
and in essence the model behind this is

906
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">a user just like a doing it will</font>

907
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,909
purchase a telephone number registered

908
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:52,500
inside the public enum server and then

909
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:54,420
they would be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to designate who</font>

910
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,580
their service provider is it's almost

911
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">like an LNP replacement so just because</font>

912
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,939
the number is inside the public enum

913
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,679
system doesn't necessarily mean you can

914
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">route that call you know based on the</font>

915
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">URI that's listed in the public enum</font>

916
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,230
system so it never really took off and

917
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very saw now there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

918
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:11,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries that are actually trying to</font>

919
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:13,410
change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that the public or using</font>

920
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,180
you know systems are designed so what

921
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:17,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're saying is yeah a user can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

922
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:18,450
the telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number and register it but</font>

923
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,850
if that once at once<font color="#CCCCCC"> that user has</font>

924
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,680
selected the carrier that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kara will have</font>

925
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,689
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept the call from anyone for free</font>

926
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,300
and that works actually quite

927
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:28,860
fascinating and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

928
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,270
that's where we moved to ultimately in

929
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:32,850
Norfolk voice therapy to really succeed

930
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:35,639
meaning in terms of being a part of the

931
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:38,459
internet like email and web it has to be

932
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,990
just like that same model where the

933
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:42,120
biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> growth of enum right now has</font>

934
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:44,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">been in private private enum systems</font>

935
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,229
though also<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite often referred to as</font>

936
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,450
carrier or infrastructure enum systems

937
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,520
they're typically systems that are

938
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:53,460
offered by a collective group like a

939
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,230
federation or community or by<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh by a</font>

940
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,480
private<font color="#E5E5E5"> entity or a clearing house and</font>

941
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,670
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually have a Pacific policy</font>

942
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,780
associated with that enum system but

943
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,880
what's important with these<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

944
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:05,280
systems is any number is listed inside

945
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,660
those enum databases you can rub those

946
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,460
calls directly you know to the

947
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination based on whatever na PTR</font>

948
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,310
records are listed in unlike<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public</font>

949
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,310
enum systems

950
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:21,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so in the industry there's a number</font>

951
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:25,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">of companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providing peering services</font>

952
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:28,100
that are based on sip and enum there's

953
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:30,470
spider spider registry that I guess a

954
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,639
nonprofit organization ran by net number

955
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,250
and our<font color="#CCCCCC"> banette are potencia</font>

958
00:33:37,669 --> 00:33:42,289
voice bearing fabric you should these

959
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:44,600
have different models very different

960
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:47,000
models the first is the accessibility

961
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,408
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you access these services so you</font>

962
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,880
can access<font color="#E5E5E5"> them over the public internet</font>

963
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:51,740
can access them at internet peering

964
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,880
points or they may have dedicated

965
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,360
networks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of the voice</font>

966
00:33:52,880 --> 00:34:00,740
peering fabric let me put this into a

967
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:03,289
little bit better contacts here so okay

968
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">so these organizations what the aim to</font>

969
00:34:03,289 --> 00:34:07,399
do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you'll be able to help you out</font>

970
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,869
calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPA to IP in order to do that they</font>

971
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,089
have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types applications some</font>

972
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:12,230
of them have native<font color="#CCCCCC"> edem databases we</font>

973
00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:13,190
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk worry you can get the IP</font>

974
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,679
address where the about their culture

975
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,060
directly in a peer-to-peer fashion some

976
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,950
of them don't offer our native enum

977
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,750
access instead what they offer you is a

978
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:22,939
sip application where you send a sip

979
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:24,349
invite to them and then they'll proxy

980
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,300
your call or send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it through or to</font>

981
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:27,500
redirect message back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and then</font>

982
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,659
they'll brought that calls<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

983
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,580
destination it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like so if you</font>

984
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the email analogy if i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

985
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:34,909
send email<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to send my</font>

986
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,348
email to your mail server and then your

987
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,669
mail servers determine how<font color="#CCCCCC"> those can be</font>

988
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:40,190
routed and then for the mail on my

989
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:42,109
behalf to you so the in essence they are

990
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:45,020
proxying the call from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a signal</font>

991
00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:46,549
perspective the RTP traffic to the best

992
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,710
of our knowledge based on research you

993
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:50,210
know that we gathered over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web there</font>

994
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,220
are two p is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly between the</font>

995
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:56,179
subscribers between the networks that

996
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:59,810
you are appearing with directly yeah so

997
00:34:56,179 --> 00:35:02,300
okay so signaling is proxied and RTP is

998
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:04,099
not proxied the quote now the problem is

999
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,859
quality insurance so if you're running

1000
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,510
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public internet in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the case</font>

1001
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:10,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're proxying calls they can</font>

1002
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:12,170
guarantee<font color="#E5E5E5"> the signaling quality because</font>

1003
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,609
obviously the signal has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come in and</font>

1004
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,160
it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go out so they can measure the</font>

1005
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:18,500
college quality attributes with them but

1006
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,540
if they're not proxying RTP they cannot

1007
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,910
tell you the quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the actual voice</font>

1008
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,960
call so we may have a good signaling you

1009
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:25,910
know because we're going through this

1010
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,720
middle person but there r TP<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

1011
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:29,540

telecom industry is a lot of legacy

1175
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:04,250
telcos are facing strong competition

1176
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:06,260
from non-traditional players they need

1177

to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to react very quickly against</font>

it's all about applications telecom is

1192
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,920
based because voice is now an

application just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like email and web and</font>

1194
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,780
so forth so<font color="#E5E5E5"> traditionally voice was</font>

1195
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,149
bundled with the pots line you know and

1196
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:47,270
that's no longer the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> even TV</font>

service human<font color="#CCCCCC"> mso's are faced with a big</font>

1198
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:51,860
challenge if you want to watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV you</font>

1199
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,260
had to get a coax line cable TV you know

1200
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,570
much TV with<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet that's no longer</font>

1201
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,730
true you can get TV by streaming right

1202
00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:00,770
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website if you get hulu hulu</font>

1203
00:41:58,730 --> 00:42:01,430
com as an example you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and I was</font>

1204
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:03,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about all the industries</font>

1205
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:04,640
intersecting the media companies want to

1206
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to deliver TV</font>

1207
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,670
content directly to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end user any</font>

1208
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:09,319
time of the day<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time you want so you</font>

1209
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:11,240
no longer have to be fixated on the TV

1210
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:12,769
and that changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire paradigm</font>

1211
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,269
also just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how Google is changing</font>

1212
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:16,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the paradigm you know with advertising</font>

1213
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:18,319
the same thing applies you know and

1214
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:20,569
economics apply to everything else too

1215
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,829
so in order for traditional talking be

1216
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:24,079
able to compete they have to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1217
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">pdi-p then they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to peer</font>

1218
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">then networks with other organizations</font>

1219
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,859
on an IP level especially with voice

1220
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:32,960
traffic and again the goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remove</font>

1221
00:42:30,859 --> 00:42:35,029
TDM connections and to limit all these

1222
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,319
conversions because again you're losing

1223
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:39,319
features every time you're converting

1224
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,940
and you degrading the calls and more

1225
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:42,500
importantly it provides a very easy way

1226
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:45,559
to separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> attacks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with other</font>

1227
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,829
organizations very rapidly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I hope</font>

1228
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:50,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that makes sense and with that I'll</font>

1229
00:42:48,829 --> 00:42:51,799
liked open up with any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1230
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,180
the audience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have any</font>

1231
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:56,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just feel free to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the mic</font>

1232
00:42:53,180 --> 00:43:00,710
here in the center of the room sorry if

1233
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:05,299
I spoke a little too fast does this make

1234
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:07,609
sense I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> curious um how many of</font>

1235
00:43:05,299 --> 00:43:12,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are operating a voice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over IP</font>

1236
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:14,328
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and are you guys doing any</font>

1237
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:17,410
type of IP interconnects for voice yet

1238
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:17,410
with other<font color="#E5E5E5"> carriers</font>

1239
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:23,769
we also

1240
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,220
so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing prefix based routing</font>

1241
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,980
yeah have you looked at using enum

1242
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:42,040
potentially as a replacement for the LCR

1243
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:44,350
tables okay so okay makes sense and you

1244
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:50,609
mentioned you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were also doing IP to a</font>

1245
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:50,609
void okay

1246
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,839
yeah sure

1247
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:28,860
yeah I mean yeah actually it's a good

1248
00:44:27,150 --> 00:44:30,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah it's a good point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the</font>

1249
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,750
carriage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with who</font>

1250
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,890
have IP voice<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharpie deployed they have</font>

1251
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:36,210
two separate networks they have the

1252
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:37,440
public internet access network you know

1253
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,210
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything goes through it and</font>

1254
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,730
then they have a separate network just

1255
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:44,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">for carrying voice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your IP the arden lon</font>

1256
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:45,930
carriers are now not using<font color="#CCCCCC"> that private</font>

1257
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:47,190
voyeur IP network to tighten to the

1258
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,700
public in terms of the quality and

1259
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:52,050
security constraints so so that's why

1260
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:53,160
like for example the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

1261
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:55,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">attractive because it's nothing to do</font>

1262
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> era but yeah it's still</font>

1263
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,620
IP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it still uses internet addressing</font>

1264
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,780
it's this like an exchange I mean like

1265
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,600
an IX so we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1266
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,550
sea legs a lot of pts that are using a

1267
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,350
system like this to remove cause I p

1268
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:09,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to handle the quality constraints</font>

1269
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,160
so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's interesting a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1270
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,260
customers that work with when you're

1271
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,580
running multi gigas of traffic if you

1272
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where sharpie it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

1273
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:18,810
small packets so the PPS rates pack up

1274
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,430
our second rates are very high so that

1275
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:22,080
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like a denial of service attack</font>

1276
00:45:20,430 --> 00:45:23,910
from some people's perspective and that

1277
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,830
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly kill some routers in them</font>

1278
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:27,870
in between<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and the other party and</font>

1279
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:29,640
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very well connected in</font>

1280
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,440
terms that you're not will appear this

1281
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,970
is a serious issue and in the voice

1282
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,520
industry it's all about total quality

1283
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:37,980
business and residential consumers will

1284
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,300
not tolerate poor quality I think if you

1285
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,010
tell them it's a mobile service that's

1286
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,570
different because everyone's come to

1287
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,580
expect mobile services on reliable but

1288
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,020

00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:05,129
a lot if you talk to any major wholesale

1309
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:28,930
in the network and is very sensitive to

five years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> we support a wide range</font>

now on average over a billion minutes a

1334
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:25,880
day of voice traffic on the platform so

1335
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:29,360
we're seeing huge acceptance of moving a

1336
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:32,450
voice to you know to IP in terms of

1337
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,980
moving into a VoIP format and and it's

1338
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:35,180
only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue to grow when we</font>

1339
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:37,130
launched the vpf the first three years

1340
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">has been very fast you know we saw</font>

1341
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:41,690
growth rates are about 78 times per year

1342
00:47:39,350 --> 00:47:43,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and now it's obviously still done but</font>

1343
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:45,109
the growth is still a very significant

1344
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:48,440
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're seeing double growth you</font>

1345
00:47:45,109 --> 00:47:50,930
know over the last two years so and

1346
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,640
that's going to grow even further now

1347
00:47:50,930 --> 00:47:53,960
while we're on the subject I mean

1348
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,310
there's a number of announcements out

1349
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,160
there like if you like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> British Telecom</font>

1350
00:47:55,310 --> 00:48:01,850
their goal is to shut down the PSTN in

1351
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:03,140
the UK by 2010 and so that means they

1352
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:05,779
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move they had to have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> entire</font>

1353
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:07,190
network all ip-enabled and and to the

1354
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:10,640
most part they'll be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think by</font>

1355
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:12,890
then I now which I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> kpn going around</font>

1356
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:14,210
the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> road france telecom and telecom</font>

1357
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:16,400
italia they want to start shutting down

1358
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:18,619
there you know TDM networks because it's

1359
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">very expensive to operate ATM network</font>

1360
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:21,950
and also voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> or RP network so the</font>

1361
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:22,940
sooner you can do so you can shut one

1362
00:48:21,950 --> 00:48:24,080
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and move it to the other you're</font>

00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to get huge operational</font>

1364
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:27,859
efficiencies also and that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

1365
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:31,790
to quickly now start developing new

types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of communication applications so I</font>
