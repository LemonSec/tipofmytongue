00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,450
led to the meat to the emission and

20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,298
maintenance and also providing them with

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:10,100
increased productivity pointing out you

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:14,939
know where networks behaviors such as

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:19,110
smaller recurrent heavens<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok first very</font>

24
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:21,240
few principles well for every router

25
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,180
connected to the trash collector well

26
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,780
you just know at heaven moment as it has

27
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,670
passed use to reach every prefix and

28
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,970
when you observe<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this pass</font>

29
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:35,759
well it peers that every<font color="#E5E5E5"> route or higher</font>

30
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:38,789
as preferred passed over time to reach

31
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,570
any prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> be this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we're going</font>

32
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:45,390
to call the primary path of r2p when I

33
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:49,439
mean a preferred<font color="#CCCCCC"> path I mean this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

34
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,229
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> used pass when you watch the</font>

35
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:57,478
dynamics and it's pat it's used over

other<font color="#CCCCCC"> Horrors days and in weeks what is</font>

37
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,509
more it disappears that well most of the

38
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,340
time a given source router which is a

39
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,149
return connected to the trash collector

40
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,540
well it uses<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of the time the same</font>

41
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:13,210
primary path to reach all the prefixes

42
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:17,140
originated by a gay

43
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:19,600
yes so here for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

44
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:22,959
represented the rotors connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

45
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,960
views thanks and have<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drawn all</font>

46
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:30,040
primary path they use to reach the

47
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:34,750
prefixes originated by Asia net this is

48
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:39,340
a double circle ks at the top yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20,000</font>

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:43,740
858<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what you can notice too is that</font>

50
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:47,590
well the title folds primary pass well

51
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:50,830
it's it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like let's say a tree</font>

52
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay when you watch it the graph there</font>

53
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,710
are the form well it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a tree</font>

54
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:59,769
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to call the</font>

55
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:04,120
origin es tree related to aes 20 sales

56
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:08,320
and 858 ok so now well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this very</font>

57
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:12,240
link fails well<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming that there is</font>

58
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">only one link between these two yes well</font>

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">after some time the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Reuters connected to</font>

60
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,200
the tooth trash collector well they

61
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,990
should either announce a back pass to

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,530
reach the destination or at least should

63
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:28,660
withdraw their primary pass but anyway

64
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:32,140
in both cases what you're going to

65
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,299
observe that all the primary past which

66
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,359
were used to reach the destination well

67
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:41,170
they are just no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer available or</font>

68
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,680
said another word another way the origin

69
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,140
es tree is just failing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the branches</font>

70
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:52,060
which are the primary pass are becoming

71
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:54,369
unavailable so now well you can see her

72
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,040
cat just like a very big state machine

73
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:01,960
which keeps track for every pass of the

74
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">state available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or unavailable and it</font>

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:07,270
computes<font color="#E5E5E5"> periodically is primary pass</font>

76
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:10,510
and it keeps on them listening to<font color="#CCCCCC"> update</font>

77
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:14,620
it detects the<font color="#CCCCCC"> availabilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of primary</font>

78
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:19,329
pass and correlate same just in order to

79
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:23,680
find out what<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the events the indata</font>

80
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:27,060
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> heavens which have led to the well to</font>

81
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:31,030
the spread of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp have debt collector</font>

82
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,569
ok so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to try to do a short</font>

83
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,568
live demo

84
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,320
ok

85
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so here it is what you can see that</font>

86
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:16,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a panel with options you can</font>

87
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:19,930
set in order to filter heavens you're

88
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:24,010
looking for so first let's enter the

89
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:27,430
chicken cobb and let's say we're

90
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:32,219
interested in seeing heavens since let's

91
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,220
say well no<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance</font>

92
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:54,270
okay okay so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does a cat says says</font>

93
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:59,419
okay i have found<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4925 heavens dis</font>

94
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:04,799
tanked<font color="#E5E5E5"> evans but in total i have seen</font>

95
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:08,040
14,000 289 event occurrences what does

96
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">it mean it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means that in fact some of</font>

97
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:15,390
this event had occurred more than once

98
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:19,050
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell this okay so this is</font>

99
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:22,469
just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> result page so for each haven't</font>

100
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:25,080
is that it has found her cat display a

101
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:28,980
summary let's say yes it's similar so

102
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:33,270
you have a small picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the event</font>

103
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:36,630
which shows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> older primary pass which</font>

104
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,210
have been impacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by Z haven't you also</font>

105
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:43,080
have basic information so here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7th</font>

106
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:47,549
has impacted only one<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffics and we</font>

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:51,810
can say that well the originators of

108
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:55,380
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> havens so it has localized the</font>

109
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:59,850
origin of the event between these two

110
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:04,800
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then on the right you have a</font>

111
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:07,230
list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> date and these dates well the</font>

112
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are the dates at which the event</font>

113
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:15,270
has occurred<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

114
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:20,570
different kind of event and<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so big</font>

115
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:24,030
ones smaller and okay for instance here

116
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:28,219
you see that this very event well it has

117
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:31,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">occurred 215 times since yesterday and</font>

118
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:36,150
here are all the dates at which it has

119
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:39,240
occurred since yesterday then when you

120
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,539
click on a date air card is going to

121
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">display all the details about the event</font>

122
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:48,600
including pass exploration for all the

123
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:51,210
impacted prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to show in</font>

124
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,930
detail but first let's play with some

125
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,210
so for instance let's say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just</font>

126
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,370
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing big heavens so</font>

127
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:06,560
heavens which have impacted more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

128
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:06,560
origin es trees<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here there are</font>

129
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,940
just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you some examples</font>

130
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:25,179
and now a very interesting point in my

131
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">point of view at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least the logical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> query</font>

132
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:30,008
<font color="#CCCCCC">cause you know here you have a lot a lot</font>

133
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">of heavens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and maybe you're just</font>

134
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,740
interested in some of them so the

135
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:38,289
logical query provides you with a way to

136
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:41,459
filter heavens so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance let's say</font>

137
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:49,259
I'm just interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing Evans</font>

138
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:55,599
closed by let's say well unit or maybe

139
00:08:49,259 --> 00:09:02,009
advanced caused by just try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find the</font>

140
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:05,949
pipe<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is Evans caused by I know</font>

141
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:10,329
feel about crossing from sams or maybe

142
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:14,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see Evans which have</font>

143
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:19,508
impacted prefixes originated by<font color="#CCCCCC"> sprint</font>

144
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:21,250
or maybe you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in seeing</font>

145
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:25,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">Holsey heavens which I've impacted I</font>

146
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:28,949
know that says this very is very

147
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:28,949
traffics<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

148
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:39,270
okay so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me detail leave it what I've</font>

149
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:42,860
written here in fact the logical query

150
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:45,360
it's made of<font color="#CCCCCC"> elementary queries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

151
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:48,360
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of different elementary</font>

152
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,640
queries you can use in our cat for

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:57,480
instance this one well it enables you to

154
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,420
well when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you write or high followed by</font>

155
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,670
an a nice and highest number then it

156
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:07,010
allows you to search for the events

157
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:11,880
which have been caused by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> es okay</font>

158
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:14,610
when you write<font color="#E5E5E5"> tree followed by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice</font>

159
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:16,529
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's going to display all</font>

160
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:20,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the events which have impacted the</font>

161
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:24,540
prefixes originated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> z7 by this is</font>

162
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:27,990
sorry and here when you write a p equal

163
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,240
and followed by prefix well it's going

164
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,339
to search for all the events which have

165
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,250
impacted is very prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay there are</font>

166
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,710
lots of wells are other elementary

167
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:41,130
queries to search for atoms which have

168
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:44,040
impacted less or more specific prefixes

169
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:47,220
and what is interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that in fact</font>

170
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,060
all these elementary queries well you

171
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:54,780
can combine them using logical hand and

172
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:57,359
logical<font color="#CCCCCC"> or and parent ases so here I've</font>

173
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,959
just combined all my elementary queries

174
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:05,970
with using whore ok this is logical

175
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:08,310
whore and so what I'm searching here are

176
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:13,170
all the events which satisfies this

177
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:18,329
global query so let's see there are some

178
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:22,689
heavens corresponding yes there seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

179
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:27,790
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

180
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:36,280
and well now<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's in detail one of them</font>

181
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:40,060
so first sense this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here</font>

182
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,079
what you have is first picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

183
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:46,660
heavens so as I've just said previously

184
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:50,650
it shows all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the primary paths which</font>

185
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:54,819
have become<font color="#E5E5E5"> available because of the</font>

186
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:57,880
heavens so at the top you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hairs</font>

187
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,700
which are double circle it means that

188
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:04,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are originals of some prefix which</font>

189
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,880
have been impacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the heavens at the</font>

190
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:10,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have IP addresses again</font>

191
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,760
I'm gonna<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you have IP addresses</font>

192
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,920
these are the IP addresses of the

193
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:20,530
routers connected to the trash collector

194
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:24,430
and and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> what haircuts shows it</font>

195
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:26,800
that well the more likely all those

196
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:28,930
paths and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the variabilities have been</font>

197
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:37,120
caused by an event occurring between

198
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:39,939
these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> es okay so okay so your basic</font>

199
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,700
information here are all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the origin es</font>

200
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:46,930
with prefixes were impacted by the ovens

201
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:50,680
and below you have the detail for every

202
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:53,140
origin es of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prefix you have the</font>

203
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,479
details<font color="#CCCCCC"> for every prefix it originated</font>

204
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,490
and which have become which have been

205
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:02,220
impacted you have the detail of all the

206
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:02,220
paths which have become unavailable

207
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:15,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so for instance here you see this</font>

208
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">es well it originates this prefix these</font>

209
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:22,600
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reuters connected to the trash</font>

210
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:25,210
collector and these are the primary pass

211
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,020
they were using so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> so for instance</font>

212
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">this first router well it belongs to</font>

213
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:37,720
this es and he was using this prime this

214
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:41,920
prime sorry it was using this primary

215
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:45,910
pass to reach this prefix which belongs

216
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,209
which is originated by ccs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what</font>

217
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:54,850
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can say is here it says that at</font>

218
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:58,270
this date this router has known that its

219
00:13:54,850 --> 00:14:01,180
primary pass was no longer available and

220
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:03,490
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> closing time the other</font>

221
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,219
rooters I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said said the same</font>

222
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:09,730
thing to the trash collector so now if

223
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:12,430
you click on the prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hackett displays</font>

224
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past exploration the different</font>

225
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:19,630
Reuters had undergone during the event

226
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:22,780
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our altar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this was the</font>

227
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:26,410
primary pass he was using so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far and at</font>

228
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:31,000
this date well just withdrawn its

229
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:34,240
primary pass and you see that about

230
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:40,560
seven minutes later well attendance the

231
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:45,300
new pass and finally few seconds after

232
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:50,130
later please yeah

233
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:53,160
so just few seconds later it ruin onst

234
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:57,839
its<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary pass to the trash collector</font>

235
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,829
meaning in fact that the heavens<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as</font>

236
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:06,180
just recounted the event is over and

237
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:08,010
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that okay using her cat</font>

238
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:14,699
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the enricher bleep periods</font>

239
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:17,540
caused by the by heaven<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now back</font>

240
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,540
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presentation</font>

241
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:31,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so just keep this part because I've</font>

242
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:35,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">done it on life and now I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

243
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:39,649
present<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube case study first one is</font>

244
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> January cable breaks so I'm sure</font>

245
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:45,199
you've all heard about it maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

246
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,769
them have spent a night trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix</font>

247
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:51,109
that mess and well anyway it was worth

248
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:55,279
very well documented by Renesys that

249
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">unzell blog special is provided this</font>

250
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,709
curve which shows number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Egyptian</font>

251
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:06,100
networks which have become unreachable

252
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:10,399
during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day of the cable breaks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

253
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:13,190
so there is a challenge where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

254
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,519
try to redraw this curve using<font color="#CCCCCC"> honey</font>

255
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:20,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">rocket results and we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

256
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:25,699
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's different peaks in this</font>

257
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:30,019
curve correspond to so first thing we

258
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:32,540
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in fact to build a logical query</font>

259
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:35,990
to extract all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Egyptian heavens</font>

260
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:39,620
caused by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cobble break and then</font>

261
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:41,810
we'll we'll draw the enrich ability and

262
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,420
reach ability curve for each of these

263
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:47,089
events and we'll send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

264
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:52,630
whether we're able to redraw the curve

265
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:57,440
so using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Renesys and other data sources</font>

266
00:16:52,630 --> 00:17:02,029
you are you have here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Egyptian</font>

267
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:05,390
providers which were more impacted by

268
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:11,240
the cable breaks and here you have their

269
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:14,990
upstream providers whereas more well a

270
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,059
camel break well it can be seen as a you

271
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:20,599
know a multiple link failures in fact

272
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:23,178
between he has which<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair through the</font>

273
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:27,198
transmission link which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> supported by</font>

274
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:30,860
Vice cable and what is more under

275
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,780
haircut formalism well

276
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:37,740
focusing on her<font color="#CCCCCC"> shipped well we should</font>

277
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:41,040
see many origin he has rooted in Egypt

278
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:48,810
well we should see these this origin es

279
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:51,800
trees fading so so more precisely now

280
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:55,200
the heavens were going to search our

281
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:59,610
heavens either caused by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Egyptian</font>

282
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,160
providers themselves or caused by the

283
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,219
upstream providers but which but which

284
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,770
have impacted the prefixes originating

285
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">by the Egyptian providers so for</font>

286
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,860
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> for nylon line we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

287
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,030
build<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the following logical query</font>

288
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:21,990
sorry the following logical query so

289
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:26,280
we're searching heavens caused by an eye

290
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:28,800
on line itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> horror we're searching</font>

291
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:32,190
heavens which have impacted the prefixes

292
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:36,950
it originates and which have been caused

293
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:40,680
by at least one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its upstream provider</font>

294
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:44,040
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a logical query just 499 and</font>

295
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:48,480
now we do we do the same for all the

296
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">Egyptian providers and using me logical</font>

297
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:56,280
whore we just build this huge logical

298
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:58,889
query which we expect will give us all

299
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:03,660
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Egyptian heavens goes by the cable</font>

300
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:09,630
breaks so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> setting this query in our</font>

301
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:13,860
cat here and we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> set the search period</font>

302
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:18,390
too well the same period as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Britney this</font>

303
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:21,360

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> have impacted mini pass so doing</font>

so and asking how<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut the tool answers</font>

what's happening so at first thirty in

331
00:20:54,790 --> 00:21:02,139
the morning well the different prefixes

332
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:07,600
originated by ccs words have just become

333

and the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and now well just</font>

obtain and<font color="#CCCCCC"> while comparing this care of</font>

348
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:10,960
with really this one here's what we get

349
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:12,970
so there is it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the match so</font>

350
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,190
what does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it means that when did</font>

351
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:18,340
succeeded in rebuilding Renesys curve

352
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:23,440
using only harkat results and what is

353
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:25,810
more for in fact we have shown that this

354
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,210
global curve was made of six smaller

355
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,730
ones related to six different heavens

356
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:34,990
and we have explained what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font>

357
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:38,170
pics were corresponding to so now let's

358
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:41,340
in detail one of these heaven for

359
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:44,920
instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last one so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

360
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:47,379
picture of the heavens so you see her

361
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:50,470
cat has inferred that the event had been

362
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:55,180
caused by something between today and

363
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:59,580
see bone and here you have some foraging

364
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,580
areas of just pointing some some of them

365
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:11,320
then here you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the detail for some</font>

366
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:15,790
primary pass joining prefixes or genetic

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:19,270
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> niall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 and so you see that all these</font>

368
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:25,030
paths have become an invaluable at<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

369
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:27,540
12 23 and finally when you watch the

00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:32,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">past exploration reality to this prefix</font>

371
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:36,580
this one well is what you get so you see

372
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:38,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">that well every router connected to the</font>

373
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,939
trash collector well they have whole

382
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:21,249
interesting feature of our cats well as

383
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:25,960
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see at first sight well it seems</font>

384
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:29,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be a very small event you can notice</font>

385
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,710
there is only one prefix impacted only

386
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:38,259
four rotors among the 16 have lost their

387
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:41,469
primary pass even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bass exploration</font>

388
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:44,739
is very limited you see that the event

389
00:24:41,469 --> 00:24:49,869
we converge very fastly it lasts only

390
00:24:44,739 --> 00:24:51,999
for a few seconds and there's quite new

391
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:54,968
unreachable<font color="#CCCCCC"> lity because of this haven't</font>

392
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:58,089
in fact here's a question why should we

393
00:24:54,969 --> 00:25:00,429
care about such an event at first sight

394
00:24:58,089 --> 00:25:03,908
there's no reason well in fact there is

395
00:25:00,429 --> 00:25:06,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">a serious reason to care about it it</font>

396
00:25:03,909 --> 00:25:09,369
because it has occurred ten thousand

397
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:12,969
seven hundred fifty seven times in the

398
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:16,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">month so it means that on average it has</font>

399
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:18,969
occurred every four minutes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> haverhill</font>

400
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:20,918
four<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes the rooters allows the</font>

401
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:24,669

00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:26,950
decision process selecting new<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass and</font>

403
00:25:24,669 --> 00:25:31,179
downs them<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds</font>

405
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:36,690
they retrigger the decision process and

406
00:25:33,609 --> 00:25:39,999
so on its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in fact as you can see</font>

407
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:42,940
such an avian put a pretty useless

408
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:47,409
stress on the router and a worldly

409
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:50,729
should just not exist and the very

410
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:55,559
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not at all an</font>

414
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,590
it's showing is that well you have only

415
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,680
twenty percent of the total number of

416
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:15,520
occurrences of events which were caused

417
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:18,480
by Evans occurring only ones which could

be expected to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> normal case in fact</font>

423
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:37,720

00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:09,840
exchanging the internment will they are

432
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:12,669
related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in fact few heavens we just</font>

433
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:17,409
occur again and again and again and

434
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:19,450
again so so fixing them fixing these

435
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:22,900
heavens which occurs so much so many

436
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:26,230
times well it would just reduce

437
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:29,440
tremendously the rate of bgp updates in

438
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:36,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internment and it could help reduce</font>

439
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:40,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stress on routers so know so well</font>

440
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:43,120
when I can just<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that maybe you</font>

441
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,520
wonder wise these events occurring wise

442
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,360
they are not fixing well<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally I</font>

443
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:53,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">personally I think that as i have shown</font>

444
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,590
previously well see event has not caused

445
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:02,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">unreachable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> UT doesn't seem to have this</font>

446
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:06,159
heaven<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> preparation well it didn't</font>

447
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,659
cause enrich ability so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

448
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:10,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font>

449
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:14,410
finances were not depreciated and as a

450
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:16,530
consequence no<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer would never</font>

451
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:19,570
complain for such an event cuz it doesnt

452
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:22,480
depreciate performances and because no

453
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,310
customers complain about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> well no</font>

454
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,650
network operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> how gonna search for</font>

455
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:32,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">them so the children's are just</font>

456
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:37,890
invisible but you see that the hair a

457
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:42,100
lot in tournament dynamics so well

458
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:46,960
things to her cat well such heavens are

459
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:51,490
now pointed out and so network para

460
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:54,490
tales can now investigate to find out

461
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:56,500
why they<font color="#E5E5E5"> occur is it because of some in</font>

462
00:28:54,490 --> 00:29:02,880
trailer<font color="#E5E5E5"> main oscillation I just know</font>

463
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:06,220
maybe some made a viola or a tricky<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

464
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:10,300
configuration but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of that</font>

465
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">today with our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cats you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

466
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:15,399
such heavens and then you are able to

467
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:20,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">investigate and find out why they occur</font>

468
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:22,090
and fix them and for well maybe we're

469
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:26,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to succeed in pacifying seen</font>

470
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:28,889
tournament I thank you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

471
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,889
equation

472
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,510
sorry

473
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,760
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question my name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ray</font>

474
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">junction i'ma i'm from princeton</font>

475
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:54,240
university so path<font color="#E5E5E5"> laps exploration</font>

476
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:58,250
after failure seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

477
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:02,220
because it really delays<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp convergence</font>

478
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:04,350
since you are seeing a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

479
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,880
the dynamics that's going on have you

480
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:13,800
thought about ways to improve to reduce

481
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,820
path acceleration well that's a good

482
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:21,440
question what our kid doesn't hey Matt

483
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">reducing past exploration I think that</font>

484
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:29,760
mainly aims at pointing out strange

485
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,030
behaviors or well helping<font color="#CCCCCC"> Knox during a</font>

486
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:35,040
big head age to to provide them with

487
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:38,210
with feedback on what's going on and and

488
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:44,090
and and fixing problems may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be faster</font>

489
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:44,090
but while i'm working on on other

490
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:51,830
mechanism to to reduce past exploration

491
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:56,100
but maybe maybe you you're talking about

492
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:58,830
some some works which wanted to use root

493
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:03,080
cause analysis to to reduce pass

494
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:03,080
exploration identifying for instance

495
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:10,889
pass which were no longer valid sure

496
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,140
thats that would be one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and</font>

497
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:15,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about some other ways as well</font>

498
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">i just wonder if you have thought about</font>

499
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:21,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are actually seeing the you</font>

500
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the real world dynamics did you say</font>

501
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:25,980
you are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on something like that</font>

502
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,100
so right did you say you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

503
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,950
working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> path exploration yeah on the</font>

504
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">reducing pass exploration but oh it's</font>

505
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,900
not gonna be done using her cousin lysis

506
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:40,470
oh that's why would talk afterwards

507
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,470
sexart

508
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,420
give
