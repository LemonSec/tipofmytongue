motivation<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this protocol we will</font>

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:33,470
discuss how<font color="#CCCCCC"> network designs have evolved</font>

7
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:35,269
over time to basically satisfy the

requirements of the applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,790
use these networks will specifically

10
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,330
focus on the needs for resiliency and

11
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,310
redundancy which has caused operators to

12
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,019
use more and more link aggregation

13
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:50,780
groups and ECM<font color="#E5E5E5"> peas in their network</font>

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,710
which is all good<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what has happened</font>

15
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,590
is the OEM tools have not been able to

16
00:00:53,710 --> 00:01:01,540
keep up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these changes in metal</font>

17
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:04,729
designs and as a result what happens is

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:07,610
these tools are not effective as much as

19
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:09,380
they are on a regular network in giving

20
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,930
us information about why a problem

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,740
happen or for any other reason that they

22
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:20,240
are used for we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> dive into the</font>

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,240
enhancements we feel that we can do to

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,919
these protocols will go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,229
the different network types that we can

scenario which will help us put all of

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:53,869
that together it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will show a typical</font>

application using link aggregation

groups and easy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> P it will show how</font>

37
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,460
it is likely that an<font color="#CCCCCC"> OEM tool that we</font>

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,520
use such as a paying or trace or cannot

39
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:06,979
be we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a different path then</font>

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,049
what data traffic would take we will

00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,389
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> go a step further we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will find out</font>

what<font color="#E5E5E5"> additional information</font>

43
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:16,450
we can benefit from that is not

available today they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some</font>

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,280
developments in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> area which is</font>

00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,830
actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing we feel that</font>

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a disconnect oh and basically</font>

48
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:30,820
this presentation is geared towards that

49
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,060
we come to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most important section of</font>

50
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">this discussion then we'll discuss so</font>

51
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:39,400
armed with whatever we had we would have

52
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,520
discussed by them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will go over why I</font>

53

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,630
presentation what do we intend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:50,018
back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this discussion that's</font>

56
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the the key point that I'm</font>

00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:57,220
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to basically highlight today and</font>

58
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:59,500
take your opinion on we'll go into press

59
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:01,930
for protocol operation will go or a

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,580
basic mode of operation<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

61
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,920
advanced mode of operation which opens

62
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a lot more applications we will</font>

63
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,329
also basically go over the important

64
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,080
message types we use in Trey slow

65
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:16,239
however this is not going to be a

66
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,250
detailed discussion on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nitty-gritty</font>

67
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,140
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol we will go over enough</font>

68
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:24,100
material to help all of us similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes</font>

69
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,140
with what the protocol does there are a

70
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:28,090
few issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the protocol which are</font>

71
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,119
in somewhat fluid state which are either

72
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:32,920
open issues or issues that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have taken</font>

73
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">a stand on or have an inclination</font>

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,570
towards but are not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best</font>

75
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:41,079
way to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and that's basically where</font>

76
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:44,620
we need your feedback basically if you

77
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:46,810
have any opinion if you have experiences

78
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,890
that helps us that's basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea</font>

79
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:54,220
of going<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the open issues and some</font>

80
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:57,049
of the decisions that we made and then

81
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:05,390
we'll go for question answers

82
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:06,980
any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that you have so as we</font>

83
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,459
discuss today's networks have evolved

84
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:13,160
into complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> heterogeneous entities use</font>

85
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,530
of link aggregation and ECM<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS is more</font>

86
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,930
prevalent and it's for a good reason

87
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,500
it's to add resiliency to add redundancy

88
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:23,270
to the networks which is all fine

89
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,970
however what that has done is is

90
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,430
increased the gap between what the OEM

91
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,340
tools like ping and traceroute were

92
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,770
designed to troubleshoot and and what is

93
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,520
requirement from an OEM tool today<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

94
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:39,140
troubleshoot a problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

95
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,719
some of the tools we use our destination

96
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,450
address based which does not work very

97
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,130
well when you have equal gosh multipath

98
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:49,300
when you have link aggregation<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups so</font>

99
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:53,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your troubleshooting a network issue</font>

100
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:57,290
there is also there are many cases where

101
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,840
flow based information is used to

102
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:01,640
forward the traffic again another<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

103
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,549
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> AM tools like ping and traceroute</font>

104
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:06,380
don't help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much they because</font>

105
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,310
they are destination IP address based

106
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:13,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">only other than that as I discussed</font>

107
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,890
earlier there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a it would be great if</font>

108
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:18,650
along the way that control packet or the

109
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,930
OEM packet when it goes through the

110
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,179
network along the path that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

111
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,610
would have taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> it collects information</font>

112
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,500
that is relevant to debugging the

113
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:30,260
problem and i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

114
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,540
dumping your entire register set or

115
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,669
dumping all the counters that you can

116

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am talking selective information</font>

which the<font color="#E5E5E5"> operator has control over we</font>

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,969
feel that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in being able</font>

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:53,900
comes from our customers we have

123
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussed this idea with them and so far</font>

124
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,859
the feedback has been positive it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in</font>

125
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:02,419
it is in a very early stage this

126
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:04,400
protocol and while we worked on it we

127
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,650
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very excited at the same time a</font>

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,590
little puzzled

129
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,060
we were excited because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard because</font>

130
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are doing a new protocol like with</font>

131
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,740
every new protocol there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

132
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:18,510
that we could do because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a whole</font>

133
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,820
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> ballgame and you put information</font>

134
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:23,010
that you want there you have that

135
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,200
Liberty but we were a little puzzled

136
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:28,050
because things that we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not think are</font>

137
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:30,690
really important ended up making the

138
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,340
protocol more complex a little bit more

139
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:35,190
conflicts and ping and traceroute and

140
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,700
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had to stop ourselves</font>

141
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:42,450
from doing any more analysis and design

142
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,789
on it what better group to talk to then

143
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nana</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and get your opinion on</font>

00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:49,080
whether this is the right direction

some of the open issues we will discuss

149
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:10,940
so briefly the problem statement need an

150
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:14,669
ability to trace 35<font color="#CCCCCC"> interval flows</font>

151
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:17,580
through a network need to find the exact

152
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:20,270
physical path that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> user-specified flow</font>

153
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,789
would take through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

154
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:27,810
selectively collect information along

155
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:30,810
the way now clearly<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you are adding</font>

156
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,940
more details more data to any protocol

157
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,370
which goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network it is</font>

158
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,740
important to include<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

159
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,870
information it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is important to protect</font>

160
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,480
it so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> angle to it</font>

161
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:46,020
which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't go into much detail here</font>

162
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I will discuss the location of the</font>

163
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">document that discusses all of this that</font>

164
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,940
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be very useful going</font>

165
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,180
through some of those details<font color="#CCCCCC"> and seeing</font>

166
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,320
whether all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is really justified</font>

167
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,320
or is it just too much

168
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:05,450
of course we would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> extend it to</font>

169
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,490
other network types we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

170
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:09,950
focus on ipv4 for now but it can be

171
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:12,220
extended it is designed in a way that it

172
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,590
is extendable to other network types a

173
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:18,050
very good document to read through is a

174
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:21,320
requirements document that actually

175
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,390
lists several requirements for both link

176
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:28,030
aggregation and equal cross multipath

177
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:30,050
type networks this document goes into

178
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,740
requirements for devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with</font>

179
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:36,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">switching on packets along those two</font>

180
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,810
constructs lags and ecmp or even routing

181
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:42,710
on those so it actually does a good job

182
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:45,349
of spelling out the requirements this

183
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:49,100
document also discusses interests

184
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,740
requirements some of them that's

185
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically an area that that that is</font>

186
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,860
still too far we have not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> reached</font>

187
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,350
their British document does a good job

188
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,590
of spelling out the requirements for

189

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,109
a way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will highlight why current</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thinkin or tracer protocols may not be</font>

199
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,690

here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are t1 or t2 t3 and RT for our t1</font>

has another flag that goes to RT three

207
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,530
as you can see let's assume for a second

208
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:06,250
that the data traffic actually takes the

209
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:11,230
green path the green arrow

210
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:12,970
the one that is below lag<font color="#E5E5E5"> one it is</font>

211
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,040
entirely likely that the ping and the

212
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,340
trace out packets that are originated on

213
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,969
RT one do not take the same component

214
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:24,970
link or the component lag members as the

215
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,040
data would have taken or doesn't even

216
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,900
take the lag at all and uses the

217
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,890
physical link to our Tea for Two

218
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:35,170
actually reach the destination so the

219
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:38,290
red lines here show the probable pads

220
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,270
and this is not all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths pink again</font>

we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> take the actual part that the data</font>

224
00:10:43,570 --> 00:10:46,900
would have taken but it's all

225
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:48,460
probabilistic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on the</font>

00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementation of the device that does</font>

the hashing on it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again since being</font>

228
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,180
is ping and traceroute our destination

229
00:10:52,930 --> 00:11:00,489
IP based only and the flows could be

230
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:03,069
routed or switched based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter</font>

algorithm it is likely that there is a

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:11,910
disconnect so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see here the on the</font>

234
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:15,640
link on the lag<font color="#CCCCCC"> between RT two and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

235
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:18,490
there is a soft failure on the component

236
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:20,860
through which the data is actually going

237
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,020
through which means the data is affected

238
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:25,420
now when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that report and we do a</font>

239
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:28,030
ping and traceroute as the red lines

240
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,329
show it is very possible that the pink

241
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:33,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trace route will take the other</font>

243
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:41,320
interface and completely miss the link

244
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:43,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a soft failure in this case we</font>

245
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:45,100
would not detect a problem whereas the

246
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,819
data would actually be blocked or being

247
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,530
big who would be dropped or whatever may

248
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,730

250
00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,440
so what is objective with the

information<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have so far</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trace for</font>

255
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,930
of the problems we have discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far</font>

256
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,120
we have designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be extendable to</font>

requirements which we have not touched

259
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,560
upon yet it is extendable and we can

260
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:24,240
already foresee some more applications

261
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,189
beyond troubleshooting that it can be

277
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:10,410
are open issues we will highlight and if

you have an opinion feel free that would

280
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:22,709
so again the green line here on this

282
00:13:22,709 --> 00:13:29,459
the protocol works is it sends out

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:33,480
request packets which are denoted<font color="#E5E5E5"> as t f</font>

RQ<font color="#CCCCCC"> phase flow request packets and each</font>

285
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,490
device along the path that receives this

286
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,940
request packet actually returns a

287
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:47,100
response packet which is denoted by TF

288
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:48,750
RSP frisco response how does the how

289
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,069
does that even know which component link

290
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,180
to send the packet on to send the

291
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:57,479
request packet on RT one basically

292
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,489
implements a way to determine given a

293
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,339

has specified and there is another you

295
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:06,329
could actually determine the flow by

296
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,920
providing a packet itself to the

297

application the application would

298
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,449
determine what part of the packet

outer to maintain any state about any of

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:49,419
these queries coming in as a result of

425
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:52,720
that decision RT<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 would send responses</font>

what the packet that it forwards to RT

protocol stateless so again you see a

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,620
lot more blue lines in this diagram than

433
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,270
the one before clearly indicating a

434
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,320

00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,240
address on it and it may not actually go

587
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,980
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the direction that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the data packet</font>

588
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,950
that it is trying to probe would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

589
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:08,260
taken so not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not include</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

590
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:10,570
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am requesting the legacy</font>

591
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,330
device but it actually sends it out in

592
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:14,649
the direction that is not the direction

593
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,960
through which the data would have gone

594
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:18,450
so that is a bigger problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think and</font>

595
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,230
and hence

596
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:25,419
it is unclear<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether we have thought</font>

597
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:27,279
about several different ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

598
00:27:25,419 --> 00:27:29,259
fix it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this is one of those</font>

599
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,940
things that may seem simple but it

600
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:32,590
actually makes a protocol really

601
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,179
complicated if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your way</font>

602
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:38,350
through the legacy segments of the

603
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:40,240
network you cannot expect on day one to

604
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,730
have complete support for this thing in

605
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,590
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire network your second portions</font>

606
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,080
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network may be upgraded at</font>

607
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,330
different times<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what do we do with</font>

608
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,269
legacy networks is basically a question

609
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:54,730
that we have one couple of solutions

610
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:56,559
that we had is use a pro packet that

611
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,039
looks exactly like the flow that you are

612
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,259
debugging so the trace<font color="#CCCCCC"> / request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

613
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,730
essentially the header on it would look

614
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:05,470
exactly like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data packet that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

615
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,169
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave work this way one if it</font>

616
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:10,299
hits a legacy our device it would route

617
00:28:08,169 --> 00:28:14,740
that request packet in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same way that</font>

618
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:18,700
would never<font color="#E5E5E5"> out at the data packet d so</font>

619
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:21,340
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we add a mechanism</font>

620
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,619
for each device<font color="#E5E5E5"> to identify its trace</font>

621
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,749
low capability we can work our way

622
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:27,610
through the legacy segment we can

623
00:28:25,749 --> 00:28:30,039
determine the right data path<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

624
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:33,789
the legacy segment and we can also

625
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:35,408
determine we can also get information

626
00:28:33,789 --> 00:28:38,919
from all the devices that are Trey slow

627
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:40,990
capable across legacy segments<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

628
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:43,749
problem with that is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we make the</font>

629
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:45,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">pro packets look like the radar packets</font>

630
00:28:43,749 --> 00:28:49,240
they would become indistinguishable from

631
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,830
data packets and you would not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

632
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:54,279
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> separate them from the actual data</font>

633
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:55,809
and that's a big problem you would

634
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:57,460
definitely want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to limit your control</font>

635
00:28:55,809 --> 00:28:59,499

645
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:26,760
bandwidth and there is no way for you to

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:28,710
control it other risk is the pro packet

647
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:31,440
now which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking like the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> read a</font>

actually make its way all the way to the

discussed is is what is basically make

00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:01,980
it look like data and then use stressful

659
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,390
capability detection and find your way

660
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,820
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the legacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but again the</font>

662
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:13,370
we try to do that so we decided let's

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:15,480
stop let's step back let's think<font color="#CCCCCC"> weather</font>

664
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,699
and we understand it's likely that

665
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,860
legacy networks or legacy segments will

666
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:22,260
be there<font color="#E5E5E5"> along the path that the traffic</font>

667
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,810
would take but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost that you</font>

668
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to pay to make it work with legacy</font>

669
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:29,700
is seems very huge we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploring</font>

670
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,280
other ideas and there may be other ways

671
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,780
to do this but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have a</font>

672
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,850
general sense of whether that's

673
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:38,879
direction we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to march on</font>

674
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:40,889
this is this legacy support something

675
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we cannot live without we have to</font>

676
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:46,170
have legacy support even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it means</font>

677
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:48,050
complicating the protocol when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we may be</font>

678
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:50,010
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that the probes are</font>

679
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:53,129
distinguishable from data there may be

680
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:55,500
some solutions in that direction but

681
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,140
like this like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said we decided to step</font>

682
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:00,950
back and see whether this is worth it

683
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,950
going in that direction

684
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,400
another another open issue is

685
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:12,120
encapsulation currently we are

686
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:15,140
suggesting the use of UDP but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we</font>

687
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:18,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">are not 100% sure that is a way to go</font>

688
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:21,090
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are implementations that may not</font>

689
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle it well it may need</font>

690
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,429
certain changes in certain code sections

691
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:30,030
that are sensitive and not I left and

692
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:32,760
better left untouched still UDP comes

693
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,370
out as a simple way to identify this

694
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,890
protocol and we at this point we have

695
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:39,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposed that in the document however it</font>

696
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:43,110
is likely that we may end up using a new

697
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:47,390
IP protocol type or an ICMP message type

698
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:49,889
or outer alerts or any other ways of

699
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,690
basically terminating the packet at each

700
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,970
transit device the idea here is to be

701
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:57,630
able to terminate the control packet on

702
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:59,490
each other transit devices so that's an

703
00:31:57,630 --> 00:32:01,380
area that we have taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stand but</font>

704
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,550
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sits in a fluid state we</font>

705
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,860
are not hundred percent sure that is

706
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:11,129
right way to go again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very</font>

707
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:13,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">very early stage for this protocol we</font>

708
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,760
feel there is a problem we would like to

709
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from you whether the problem is</font>

710
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,650
real that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> identified the scope</font>

711
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,030
correctly and whether we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

712
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:24,270
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> direction in terms of adding</font>

713
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:27,740
complexity to existing OEM tools to get

714
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:27,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for</font>

715
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:36,380
so again these are the open issues and

716
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:36,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> others in the document</font>

717

that's it unfortunately this version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:45,939

a lot of decisions they have taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font>

00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:12,309
we have taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and maybe some open</font>

728
00:33:10,779 --> 00:33:15,279
questions that we have that we need to

729
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:17,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">address at some stage however the</font>

730
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,899
document is very complete in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

731
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:23,139
it discusses the core concepts it

732
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:25,678
discusses approach we are taking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ate</font>

733
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:27,820
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have a list of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lists of</font>

734
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">objectives from the protocol that we are</font>

735
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:32,139
able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> achieve using the protocol</font>

736
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,178
definition we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping to be able to</font>

737
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:35,979
get feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the community and be</font>

738
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:39,549
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> close on the open issues be able</font>

739
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:41,980
to solidify<font color="#E5E5E5"> our stand on the ones where</font>

740
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:45,210
we are not so certain and any general

741
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,210
feedback on this topic would help

742
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:59,260
so just a brief message from the pc the

743
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:02,949
break is now open if anybody who wants

744
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:05,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">to go and if anybody wants to ask</font>

745
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:08,860
Michelle questions or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

746
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:11,889
suggest stuff and by all means<font color="#E5E5E5"> please do</font>

747
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:13,660
so this is what it's about people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

748
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:16,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to come up with a new protocol</font>

749
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:23,170
and if you don't speak up<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may not</font>

750
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:25,810
get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> usable hi Richard</font>

751
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:28,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">steenburgen in layer so I definitely</font>

752
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with the need for something like</font>

753
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">this you know we see on a regular basis</font>

754
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,920
a lot of problems with with lag paths

755
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:37,480
where you know you have eight paths and

756
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,580
you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a traceroute you may only</font>

757
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,320
be hitting three of those paths and one

758
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,509
path has packet loss somewhere and you

759
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,120
don't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it until some customer</font>

760
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:49,570
says I can I can load slowly every

761
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:53,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">eighth website what's going on so it</font>

762
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:56,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds like a good concept I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

763
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:59,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">about your implementation now it seems</font>

764
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:00,640
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems like there's two things</font>

765
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:02,890
you're trying to focus on one is

766
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,379
detecting which path you're going over

767
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:07,900
which it seems like the easiest way to

768
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:10,240
handle that and you know this with scale

769
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:13,270
to outside views of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network as well</font>

770
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to just do an ICMP destination</font>

771
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:18,790
unreachable extension where you say you

772
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:22,000
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is the fourth path out of an</font>

773
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:23,230
eight-member lag and that is public

774
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,430
enough information that that could go

775
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,990
out to anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has traceroute</font>

776
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,319
anywhere on the internet and then they

777
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:31,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help determine what the problem is</font>

778
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:34,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then the other problem that you're</font>

779
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:38,500
trying to troubleshoot is almost like a

780
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,110
source routed pick the lag packet and it

781
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:42,940
kind of seems like either either by

782
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:46,000
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that or by doing a</font>

783
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:48,640
tree packet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> expands everywhere both</font>

784
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,610
of these solutions seem like a bad idea

785
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">compared to just having the router have</font>

786
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:56,690
each router as part of a layer 20 am

787
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,060
have it do the probes

788
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:00,800
each one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the paths make the results</font>

789
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,779
available via SNMP and then you just go

790
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">smtp clear your router because it seems</font>

791
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:06,890
like you'll never<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to actually</font>

792
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,359
hit every one of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths from some</font>

793
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,680
central control box somewhere that's

794
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:12,529
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a traceroute through every</font>

795
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,500
possible language you might have ok

796
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:18,410
Richard what about lately O&M we're

797
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:25,660
going to create that too so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so good</font>

798
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:25,660
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what about Slayer 3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ZN p well</font>

799
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:32,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok thank you</font>

800
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:44,359
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> where have my keys links so um</font>

801
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,400
there's many different ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> skin this</font>

802
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:48,589
cat really<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's it's a very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real cat</font>

803
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,390
so I can't believe everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

804
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:51,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">psycho going looking as their laptops</font>

805
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:54,770
unless they're just running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sugar</font>

806
00:36:51,650 --> 00:37:01,040
from lunch but who here raise your hands

807
00:36:54,770 --> 00:37:03,259
do you use lag in your network yeah not

808
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">that many others Wow oh do you use ecmp</font>

809
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:07,760
in your network keep your hands up raise

810
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,310
both hands if you use both you know so

811
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,800
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this going on and there is a</font>

812
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:16,130
real need to find this stuff and I know

813
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,960
that if only<font color="#CCCCCC"> had tools like this I would</font>

814
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:20,810
have found my life in the last two

815
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:22,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">months a hell of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot easier um so</font>

816
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,700
because I was looking for needles in

817
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:27,349
haystacks so you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the main</font>

818
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:29,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is go read the draft come up with</font>

819
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:32,000
suggestions and feed into this stuff

820
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we really need this stuff</font>

821
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,349
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise you know you're</font>

822
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:39,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at an IP packet that's going</font>

823
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:42,230
over ecmp over lag with some mpls wet

824
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,190
string in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle and you are screwed</font>

825
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,990
if you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find something wrong</font>

826
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:46,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about making</font>

827
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:49,939
your life a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot easier and I</font>

828
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:52,310
really like this I think I've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

829
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:54,160
to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more people get feeding</font>

830
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,750
back into this stuff actually happens

831
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much um you go</font>

832
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,819
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yahoo and I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to echo what</font>

833
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:05,480
Mike is saying we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of ecmp</font>

834
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:07,180
over lag sometimes it translates to 64

835
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,560
paths in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end that you've traversed</font>

836
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,210
it is like looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for needles in the</font>

837
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,529
haystack when you have problems and

838
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:18,650
stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you may not care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

839
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:21,140
it now you'll care about about it three

840
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:23,210
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now when 100 gig isn't ready</font>

841
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:26,509
yet and you're doing insane amount of

842
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:30,740
flags now is the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring it up</font>

843
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:33,500
because by then it'll be too late<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks</font>

844
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,660
ago Joe my man I just wanted to clarify

845
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:38,140
what kind of scope are looking at

846
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,848
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be usable in to end</font>

847
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,038
other people's networks or something to

848
00:38:39,849 --> 00:38:44,559
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used inside a network that you plan</font>

849
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:49,420
on owning and controlling very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

850
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:52,299
question so the original intent<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short</font>

851
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer is both however the information</font>

852
00:38:52,299 --> 00:38:56,049
that we are requesting could be

853
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:58,750
sensitive across outside of the network

854
00:38:56,049 --> 00:39:02,559
and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are multiple different ways</font>

855
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:04,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the public</font>

856
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,279
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> or only information that is</font>

857
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:09,098
ok to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out publicly is sent out of a</font>

858
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:11,559
domain we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggested a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

859
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:15,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">security mechanisms to do that however</font>

860
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:16,930
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing is within a domain you</font>

861
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:18,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">can specify a list of parameters that</font>

862
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,009
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to send out and you identify</font>

863
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:22,359
the routers using their ID and the

864
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:25,029
security information that is embedded

865
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:26,589
and an outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a domain you severely</font>

866
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,930
restrict the information that you send

867
00:39:26,589 --> 00:39:32,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">out in response to this packet enough</font>

868
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:34,839
that helps the querying I know what

869
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:38,069
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong but not anything more</font>

870
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:40,119
than that so a typical implementation is

871
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:41,558
traffic goes through to service

872
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:43,509
providers and there is a problem in

873
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:46,269
service provider B's network service

874
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:48,460
provider a is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing some troubleshooting</font>

875
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:51,069
and it can determine here here provider

876
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,839
be I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the packet may be getting</font>

877
00:39:51,069 --> 00:39:55,000
blocked because of CRC's in certain

878
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:57,549
segments or maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

879
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,549
subscription can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look so</font>

880
00:39:57,549 --> 00:40:02,200
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

881
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:04,930
to send out and what is not okay to send

882
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,598
out and with security mechanisms we have

883
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:11,440
you feel that that can be achieved so

884
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,519
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> again both type of networks so</font>

885
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,690
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying that you want to delineate</font>

886
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:18,700
that for packets that leave the

887
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,230
administrative domain only enough

888
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:23,589
information that you can hand off to

889
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:25,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that AAS and say can you please look at</font>

890
00:40:23,589 --> 00:40:27,970
this and further develop the

891
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,950
troubleshoot that is our intention we

892
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,538
feel that that might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

893
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,848
preferred approach but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have other</font>

894
00:40:31,539 --> 00:40:38,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">thoughts if you have an opinion either</font>

895
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:39,620
way I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear thank you thank</font>

896
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:43,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font>

897
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean hey Louis equinix so an</font>

898
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:48,080
interesting way to use this could be

899
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:51,290
that an exchange provider especially if

900
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:53,930
it's a distributed exchange can use it

901
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:56,570
within their own network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also at the</font>

902
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:59,600
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the ISP end points for that</font>

903
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:02,480
exchange can run it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

904
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:05,839
domain to see if the exchange providers

905
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,340
network is messed up between<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is to</font>

906
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:12,700
troubleshoot any packet loss you might

907
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:12,700
have thank you

908
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,620
oh there we go Oh see ya Danny

909
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">Macpherson so I was going to Mitch I</font>

910
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:25,000
know you had a pointer in there too

911
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:26,620
Shane amante's<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft at myself and folks</font>

912
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,210
who BTW and a couple other places or

913
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:31,000
co-authored on and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a</font>

914
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:32,800
requirements document to help specify

915
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,540
protocol or solutions mechanisms you

916
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,690
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of under the ITF framework so</font>

917
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:39,070
if folks are interested at all and you

918
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:40,870
know questions like the previous one

919
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:42,250
about sensitive data being exposed and

920
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,359
one of the different context as things

921
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,470
will be employed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and where all the</font>

922
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,260
different mechanisms that need to be

923
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:49,089
provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so forth then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i recommend</font>

924
00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:50,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you you grab my slides he does have</font>

925
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,970
a pointer to that draft there and

926
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,470
provide feedback to the authors or to

927
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:56,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">the you know ops for Internet area and</font>

928
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:57,730
the ITF because you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move</font>

929
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,620
forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but to make sure we capture</font>

930
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,850
all the requirements correctly is is

931
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,470
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important and this is certainly</font>

932
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes you know goes a long way towards</font>

933
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:11,290
buying some of the solutions so thanks

934
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:13,690
thank you very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

935
