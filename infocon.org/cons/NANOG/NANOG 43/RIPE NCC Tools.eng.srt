00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:05,250
thank you my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is Andrea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cesky just</font>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,210
finished I think the most complex part

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,929
of my presentation connecting my laptop

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:15,059
second guy mark trans he is not here but

5
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:17,369
all the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will present is she</font>

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:22,049
being developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and supported by his</font>

00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:23,970
group at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ripe NCC so ripe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ncc</font>

8
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,609
information services and probably many

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,310
of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have heard of those services and</font>

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:31,529
we hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of you are using some</font>

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,350
of the tools that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to present</font>

12
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,760
and this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick update on those</font>

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:42,480
tools and services and we're also going

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,120
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce some new and probably</font>

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,949
useful and cool stuff and would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,440
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an update on this as well so we</font>

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,070
built our information services on three

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,709
main pillars and those are a TTM and

19
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:03,059
test traffic measurement<font color="#CCCCCC"> network build</font>

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,500

themselves second one is routing

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,540
information service which you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see is</font>

25
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,270
a distributed looking glass with history

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,020
and the third one is DNS morn I told

fact every node is a stratum 1 ntp

33

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,510
sometimes sometimes it gives you some

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad-hoc experiments which actually</font>

transfers TTM in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> general purpose</font>

79
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,320
you to measure something beyond just

80
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,660
connectivity just packet loss it allows

81
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,168
you to measure performance of certain

82
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,959
applications and what the idea is pretty

83
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:22,710
simple it allows you to define a plug-in

84
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,169
or a test procedure using user

85
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,530

in the TTM<font color="#E5E5E5"> network do the measurements</font>

88
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,599
collect them and present in a way you

00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:38,230
want it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and a practical example</font>

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:42,160
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance it allows you to measure a</font>

91
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:46,930
web application house in from the TTM

92
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:49,780

those ad hoc tests well this particular

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,549
one actually measures web application

95
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:57,909
it's called HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugin we have a few</font>

96
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,580
predefined plugins developed and this

97
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,780
interface allows you to specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> for how</font>

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,640
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would like to run this</font>

100
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:10,659
experiment was the region you want to

101
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:13,330
see a magic performance of your

103
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:20,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">of your web server as how you can see</font>

104
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:21,940
the results well in this particular we

105
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,659
monitored one of our web service from

106
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:30,660
three locations in European region and

107
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:32,890
you can see well it's not uniform really

108
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:35,740
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allows you to monito</font>

109
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:38,590

<font color="#CCCCCC">before the right meeting in May last</font>

112
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,159
right meeting we measured performance of

<font color="#E5E5E5">our web server right net for quite some</font>

114
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,360
time looking at how our web service

115
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,060
looks from ipv6 world as compared to

116
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,669
ipv4 well you can see some difference

117
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,740
and though the legend is not very

118
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:09,159
readable I guess you understand that rat

119
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:12,460
stands for ipv6 the next platform is

120
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,080
routing information service or risk as I

121
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,919
said one can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this as a</font>

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:35,380
searchable over three months and we also

127
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:37,419
keep raw data forever and we built quite

128
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,640
a few tools that allow to create this

129

well this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a geomap with locations of</font>

connected to big internet exchanges

with regards to you is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some of</font>

those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are similar to present it</font>

140
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,660
to Cyclops that we just heard the

142
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:26,500
sorry another slide well again idea is

143
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,070
simple myosin allows you to specify

144
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:32,710
certain conditions filters and rich data

145
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,630
will be filtered those filters looking

146
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:41,979
for conditions if conditions are matched

147
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:46,620
you as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> myosin user will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notified so</font>

148
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:49,930
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in and look at mice and alarms</font>

149
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,390
well this alarm is actually called an

150
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,930
origin alarm what it does it allows you

151
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:58,690
to specify prefix and be alerted<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this</font>

152
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:03,790
prefix is originated by someone else a

<font color="#E5E5E5">parameters of this alarm where you can</font>

155
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:11,979
specify for<font color="#CCCCCC"> how long event take place</font>

156
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,960
before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> notify how many events should</font>

158
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,719
other parameters well there are the

00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:22,300
different types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of alarms but from</font>

160
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,960

something about lack of filtering DNS

give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> update it actually service</font>

233
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,550
based on TTM network so TTM runs the

probes that do<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearing of those</font>

235
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:23,740
services and we collect this data and

236
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:27,880
present in this tag plot that actually

237
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:30,760
allows you clearly see whether the

problem is local to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> service or its</font>

239
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,610
local to TTM probe for instance if you

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:39,390
see a horizontal red line it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

the proximity of problems as related to

<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you some URLs and</font>
