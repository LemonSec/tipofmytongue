1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:09,750
and slight correction it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:14,099
update on the transfer proposal itself

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:17,520
it's more and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only is addressing</font>

4
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,859
certain routing aspects of the proposal

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:25,279
and that's because unfortunately with

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:28,529
all the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the air and ppl</font>

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,650
there's really only a handful of names

8
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,710
you see on it discussing the transfer

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:38,100
proposal and unfortunately none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

10
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,739
tries to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at how rowdy might be</font>

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,230
affected so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an appeal to</font>

12
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,260
engineers in the room do you please get

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:50,519
involved so what the presentation isn't

14
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,968
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a complete review of the</font>

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,559
transfer policy proposal which is 2082

17
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:07,170
it's not a door to debate this proposal

18
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:08,909
here at nanog what it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

20
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,210
transfer proposal 2082 and how it has

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,680

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:47,399
writing current policy allows for a

32
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,310
number resources resource transfers only

33
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:53,610
one assets using resources are sold and

present that's the current policy in a

36
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,710
nutshell this proposal that's on the

37
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:04,979
table would<font color="#E5E5E5"> open the door</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to transfers</font>

38
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:08,489
between organizations no acquisition

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,410
would be required<font color="#E5E5E5"> of assets and based on</font>

40
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:12,690
a negotiation agreement between them

41
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,570
while still meeting the justification

42
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,300
apartment that's it in a nutshell<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

43
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:22,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">well but it also can changed depending</font>

44
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:28,800
on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people give input on at PP ml</font>

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:31,040
and at the conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can this</font>

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,270
potentially affect the routing

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,519
potentially this could result in more IP

48
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:38,130
for addresses being shuffled around for

49
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,440
use and thus create more d aggregation

50
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,290
into the tables as opposed to those

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,930
sitting on a shelf not really in use you

52
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,540
might be this is good or<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad this could</font>

53
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,850
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> due to legacy or entities that just</font>

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:54,690
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not had an incentive to return</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">limit the aggregation there's a view</font>

57
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,989
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this proposal could potentially</font>

58
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,820
limit d aggregation and this help

59
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,690
prevent routing table growth if certain

60
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,880
restrictions are embedded in the policy

61
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:11,340
clearly both these bullets contradict

62
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,990
each other and that's the key reason why

63
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:15,780
I'm here there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this proposal</font>

64
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:18,270
that given how it's written it can or

65
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:24,270
cannot affect engineering with the

66
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:26,489
routing transfers must transfers must

67

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,370
could cause struggles between

the word idiocy would follow and routing

00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,139
would suffer there is the potential of

addresses being sold on the black market

103
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:09,729
being filtered out due to the user

trying to use it in another regional

105

such prefixes this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also there's also</font>

107
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,440
the potential situation where seller

00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:24,940
sells a block of address space for both

109

114
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,750
suddenly start routing it publicly and

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,530
then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

these are things that can come out of

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> proposal is to pass</font>

124
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:07,020
one potential the force net on networks

125
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:10,690
where engineers may not want it if

126
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:13,049
marketing and fly-by-night CEOs find out

127
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,490
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially cell address space</font>

128
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,039
then there's a like there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely going</font>

129
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:21,039
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a war between marketing and CEOs</font>

130
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,259
against engineering marketing will push

131
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,060
to sell address space that engineers

132
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:28,720
need to run a clean and smooth network

133
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:31,360
and push that as a replacement in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">long run it would become costly but in</font>

135
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,259
the short run to marketing and CEOs that

136
00:06:33,729 --> 00:06:38,550
don't stay put for very long in a

137
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:41,139
company it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a good quick buck</font>

138
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,880
those are just some of the aspects I'm

139
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,800
sure if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> dig into the proposal and</font>

140
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:50,979
look at engineering you're going to find

141
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:52,990
more so we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> your thoughts obviously</font>

142
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:56,110
and specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you see this</font>

143
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,729
proposal could affect routing and what

144
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,400
should be done should anything be done

145
00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:03,300
or nothing be done with the proposal if

146
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,620
