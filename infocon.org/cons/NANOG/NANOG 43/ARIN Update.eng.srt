6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,899
okay so last night Barbara and Larry and

7
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,190
I got together and we were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

8
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,040
talking about how we're going to start

9
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,820
off our presentations and through this

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,519
i'm convinced that<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers just do not</font>

11
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good senses of humor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I was</font>

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,000
waiting for to Larry to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> by to</font>

13
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:55,739
basically provide a joke so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mark</font>

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,649
or something like that but it just

15
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't happen and you guys aren't</font>

16
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:05,189
laughing either so I think I'll stop so

17
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,240
what I'm going to do and hopefully this

18
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:08,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">is something that we're going to be</font>

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,890
doing for a while is kind of give you

20
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,939
kind of a brief update what's going on

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">with an Aaron and Aaron as you know is</font>

22
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:21,270
actually your organization and it's

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,240
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can impact and we're</font>

things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to do is say okay</font>

26
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,250
here are the things we're doing are

27
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,590
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right things to do and what</font>

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:38,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want us to do is organize organize a</font>

29
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:44,009
shin<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's a fairly sort of</font>

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:49,369
impressive number whoops now what the

31
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:51,869
whois query load who is has increased

32
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,850
pretty much kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like the rest of the</font>

33
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:55,409
internet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm proud to say that our</font>

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,048
<font color="#E5E5E5">machines are actually keeping up the</font>

35
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:01,649
load no problem this turns out to be

36
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,090
about 70 queries per second which I used

37
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:04,710
to work for verisign and this is a

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,399
really small number compared to verisign

39
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,258
but still this is not too bad the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

40
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,220
slide

41
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,988
when it comes up it's much different

42
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,170
this is the routing registry query love

43
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:21,120
for its who has server and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know that</font>

44
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:24,480
there's this kind of like whole idea of

45
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,829
going green and I'm kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of considering</font>

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,420
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not we should replace this</font>

47
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,549
box with one of these low power devices

48
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:33,208
and and and basically generate

49
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:35,159
electricity by with gerbils because this

50
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,750
box is unbelievable i think it gets like

51
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:45,690
a query every four minutes or something

52
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:46,980
like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i along</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the routing</font>

53
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,200
registry one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,030
looked at is origin a asus in both

55
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,200
routing registry and what was in who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

56
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,730
and many of you know but for you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

57
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,280
don't one of the things that aren

58
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:04,099
recently implemented is the ability for

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,930
you to also as you reassign your network

60
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:10,470
that you can also put the origin a s as

61
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:13,790
part of it and you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on</font>

62
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,489
the second row here the origin found

63
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:19,040
that ninety percent of the origins found

64
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,919
and who is turned out to be correct

65
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,019
which is really cool but an irr is a

66
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:27,900
little bit less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that actually quite</font>

67
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,370
a bit less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned</font>

68
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,109
earlier we're talking about gerbils

69
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,609
powering it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm thinking about them</font>

70
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:34,379
actually selecting the right sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

71
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:36,540
response and giving it back and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

72
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:40,138
happens so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be able to get to</font>

73
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,269
that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of error rate as well you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

74
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:45,810
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the irr is also a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

75
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:48,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">behind on on origins actually being</font>

76
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,220
absolutely incorrect it's at

77
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:53,819
twenty-eight percent where's who is is

78
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,579
at nine and their seven percent of the

00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,350
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that's kind of</font>

82
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:12,250
interesting is over the last year aaron

83
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:15,720
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work with the people</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">received their allocations before Aaron</font>

86
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,950
was there but now Aaron actually holds

87
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,179
and maintains their records and we now

88
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:30,479
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a facility to allow them to be</font>

91
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,560
morning and said okay we got 127

00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,210
requests cool 78 or signed 39 are

93

pending what was this deal about this

94
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:46,690
tendon that are not required and in

95
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,160
these were either people who didn't

realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've already signed our</font>

put in an RSA for it anyhow let's see if

101
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:04,180
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so we were able to catch</font>

them you can see here below that 88-81

103
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:13,690
of them were actually sent via the web

109
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:37,300
there's now a facility put it in place

110
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,940
to do basically do the same thing we're

111
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,450
doing at v6 with the equivalent thing

112

143
00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:23,240
there's a thousand 888 small

144
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:26,360
organizations who got nine percent of

145
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:28,159
the space and 823 extra small

146
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,199
organizations and they got one percent

147
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:37,099
of space over two thousand six and two

148
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:39,709
thousand seven and here's the stats

149
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:42,378
they're broken up by cedar cider prefex

150
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:44,990
what we've given out and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see a</font>

155
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:58,580
were kind of gravitating from the night

162
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,490
now out of the space that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was given here</font>

163
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:35,270
at the number of organizations that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

United States in 34 in the Caribbean and

169
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,260
we kind of forget about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Caribbean</font>

170
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:56,839
from time to time so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we thought it'd be</font>

171
00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:00,080
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually sort of break it out by</font>

173
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,450
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we're spending a</font>

174
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,460
little bit more time with is the folks

175
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,730
down in the Caribbean since they are

176
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:13,190
part of the region a part of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> lack</font>

nick is also dealing with number of

islands<font color="#E5E5E5"> down there and you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

179
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,570
there's that there's some activity

180
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,360
that's going on down in the Latin

181
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:25,070
American region and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

182
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:33,290
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting good</font>

183
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see now in ipv4 requests and</font>

184
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:38,890
approvals it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> fairly flat from</font>

185
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:41,150
year to year in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of number requests</font>

186
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:43,610
what's kind of interesting about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that</font>

187
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:45,140
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of approvals of the</font>

approved have them number of requests

190
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,699
that were actually approved actually has

191
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:58,460
increased over time and it's gone from

192
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:02,780
fifty three percent almost half and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 506</font>

193
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:06,560
period to almost two-thirds actually

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,910
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds and no 708 period so I</font>

195
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:14,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess you guys are getting better not</font>

196
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:16,819
sending in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests in rational on</font>

197
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,970
v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> pace actually this is great to see</font>

198
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:22,730
one of the things that aaron<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

199
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:25,940
doing for a couple years now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and saying</font>

200
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:28,790
hey look ipv4 space is the free pool is

201
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,490
running out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to start</font>

202
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,520
thinking about transitioning over the v6

203
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,839
and based on these numbers more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

204
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,550
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be interested in gaining</font>

205
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,510
space and seeing what they can do with

206
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:41,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font>

207
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:43,220
and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> arose has been ipv6</font>

208
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,780
experiments all over the place and<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

209
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,260
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more in the</font>

210
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,310
future but i think these sort of

211
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,530
evangelistic sort of activities we have

212
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on is a good thing go ahead Dave</font>

213
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:57,500
Dave Meyer um so I'm working on a

214
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,760
project called lisp or whatever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

215
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:01,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys can we can talk about that</font>

216
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:04,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">later but I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an ipv6 prefix</font>

217
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,530
experimental prefix right and I said

218
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">well hey i need to / 32 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i talked to</font>

219
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,069
the people at errand then they said sure

220
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,660
it'll cost you 500 bucks a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

221
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,460
thought wow it must be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply-demand</font>

222
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,839
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are we out of / 30 tues</font>

223
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,780
already that's why they're expensive or

224
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,730
what's I mean I found that kind of odd

225
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,990
you know especially in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the especially in</font>

226
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,180
the case where like you were just<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying</font>

227
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,160
forex<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pennell experimental purposes and</font>

228
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:29,000
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go out and use</font>

229
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipv6 right uh-huh so you know it's maybe</font>

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,920
an editorial comment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just found it</font>

231
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,290
odd that for experimental use the cost

232
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,439
was so high and that's the ongoing

233
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:43,040
annual cost and i was told that i would

234
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,230
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read justify it annually so you</font>

235
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,730
know I you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you have</font>

236
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,990
any comment on that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found that a</font>

237
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit unusual especially since</font>

238
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,790
we're trying to get people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to ipv6</font>

239
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:57,050
okay Leslie you would you like to say

240
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:59,030
something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so the fee</font>

241
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,890
schedules set by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community it's not</font>

242
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,720
set by Aaron if you want it changed

243
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:06,410
please come to a meeting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> let the</font>

244
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,770
board know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the story on</font>

245
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:08,770
that and

246
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,910
to read justify<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy again</font>

247
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,620
policy set by the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy</font>

248
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:22,750
states specifically that its one-year

249
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,070
term for the experimental and you have

250
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:29,800
to read justify at the end of one year

251
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:33,400
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great thanks keep those</font>

252
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,040
questions coming so one of the things

253
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've done is right so I've been at</font>

254
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron now for about seven months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

255
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,150
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that we're trying to do</font>

256
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:46,000
is trying to overhaul the<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems over</font>

257
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:49,900
there and have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working really hard</font>

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,510
on first of all modernizing things a lot

259
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,610
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment that was there was like ten</font>

260
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:56,200
years old and actually some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the code</font>

261
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was in there is code that I wrote</font>

262
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:02,880
like 15 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so a lot of this stuff</font>

263
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:05,500
but we're actually modernizing it and

264
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,660
moving away from templates to being more

265
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,260
web-based to help help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all out as a</font>

266
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:14,020
community that the project has been

267
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,930
named Project X for lack of a better

268
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:21,370
word and this is our web-based sort of

269
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,689
activity we're looking to go but

270
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,860
actually have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first part of this</font>

271
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:28,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming up in over the summer period so</font>

272
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,880
that you'll be able to see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

273
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,800
work actually coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and start</font>

274
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,200
moving some of the stuff that may be

275
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,000
kind of awkward using templates in being

276
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:43,150
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this stuff via the web if you</font>

277
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:47,620
so choose Louie go for mark that's

278
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:50,709
moving away mean you will not support

279
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">the old stuff we're supporting old stuff</font>

280
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a while I I hope that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

281
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:56,860
actually and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all work of</font>

282
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,720
progress but I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

283
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a better sort of solution than</font>

284
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,960
using templates in the future do you

285
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,940
think just strictly interactive will be

286
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,339
sufficiently a fine or are you going

287
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:12,220
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what services or</font>

288
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:14,860
something similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> awful yeah this is all</font>

289
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:17,650
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the members want but I</font>

290
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,150
would who knows maybe it may go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

291
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:21,310
maybe templates might be the most

292
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,439
efficient sort of thing but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to</font>

293
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:24,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to a more sort of secure sort of</font>

294
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,389
system

295
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:30,449
to make this available and using tools

296
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:33,300
that people find fairly easy to use as

297
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:35,998
opposed to okay you've got to get the

298
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,709
sex top 5 a-9 certificate from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin and</font>

299
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:39,720
you got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it all this stuff go by</font>

300
00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:41,878
the way we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like five people who got</font>

301
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,980
x.509 certificates from us over the last

302
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">three years so I guess that's kind a</font>

303
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,429
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit too hard but on the other</font>

304
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:50,189
hand we need to make the system more

305
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:51,300
secure and actually that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font>

306
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:54,839
thing i'll talk about its resource

307
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:58,769
certification and as we as we start

308
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:01,679
raising the bar for people to actually

309
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing route validation we also need to</font>

310
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,240
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the weakest links are</font>

311
00:15:03,149 --> 00:15:08,189
taken care of and what I hate to have or

312
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,929
why prefer not to have happen is that

313
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:11,639
the registration services component of

314
00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:13,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">this become the wake weakest link either</font>

315
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the services that they offer are</font>

316
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:18,600
not sufficiently secure are too hard too

317
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,040
hard so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we're</font>

318
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:25,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking to actually do so let's go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on to</font>

319
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,779
resource certification this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

320
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:30,569
has also come up over the last couple

321
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">knocks I in fact I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Danny is</font>

322
00:15:30,569 --> 00:15:35,639
going to be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this again</font>

323
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:40,079
here later today in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how</font>

324
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,629
can we better secure the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour a routing</font>

325
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,949
environment and there's been work that's

326
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:50,790
been underway within ITF called secure

327
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:52,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-domain routing and when it thinks</font>

328
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is trying to do is put trust in put</font>

329
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,709
into network resources in bootstrap some

330
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:01,079
sort of route validation and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

331
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:02,579
would this means is as you receive

332
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,489
routes you can actually validate these

333
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:06,839
things offline or maybe someday<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone</font>

334
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,370
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with something is fast enough</font>

335
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually validate online</font>

336
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:13,290
we'll see but anyways the first part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

337
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is actually coming up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a sort</font>

338
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:17,519
of distribution mechanism to make that

339
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen that makes sense and this is work</font>

340
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,009
that's been done under contract with

341
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:27,540
Randy bush in<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet software</font>

342
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:29,160
consortium<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code that's you can look</font>

343
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,290
at this code<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time you want in fact</font>

344
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,339
it's available at the URL it's at the

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,839
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the screen at rob austin site</font>

346
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,690
you can see where we are and what's

347
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:41,790
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

348
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:43,900
within the resource certification arena

349
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,969
there's some fairly good documentation

350
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,740
of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest in looking nests and I</font>

351
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,040
can see that the URL is kind of messed

352
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,040
up so don't click on that right as it is

353
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know what to do but there's</font>

354
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:57,790
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly good site at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ap Nick</font>

355
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:07,839
that actually describes us in prague

356
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:10,510
edita on the resource certification do

357
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,329
you have some prediction at which point

358
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:17,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">in time you will actually allow your</font>

359

members to do to do service to do so

360
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:25,150
fatigued out saris certificates and when

361
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:28,780
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> rose will be stored that's a</font>

362
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:32,350
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so we're we have it in our</font>

363
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:34,870
plans they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this code that that</font>

364
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,090
Randy and Rob have put out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i just</font>

365
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:41,169
mentioned available by the end of the

366
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">year and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> may be not as pretty as it</font>

367
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:45,340
should be but at least we'll have it up

368
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,570
in sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pilot environment so it's</font>

369
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you guys can play with</font>

370
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,580
and I know this is big with and rife

371
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:54,340
with in your region as well as AP Nick

372
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,810
so so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is going to</font>

373
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:59,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a good thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see I'm sure you're</font>

374
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:02,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear more about in the future so</font>

375
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:07,929
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been doing is</font>

376
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:10,360
making a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> push on ipv6 and trying to</font>

377
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:14,110
get as many you to start experimenting

378
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,790
with this stuff as you can or was a big

379
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,770
push at the last nanog there was a big

380
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,840
push at the Aaron meeting there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

381
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:24,520
big push at all out regional registries

382
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:27,730
I meetings we did the ipv6 experiment

383
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:28,780
thing at at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last errand meeting and</font>

384
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:33,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing that was kind of different</font>

385
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:34,899
about that compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is that most</font>

386
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:37,660
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raised their hands and</font>

387
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,840
said yes we're the ones that we're in

388
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:43,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">the room participated and and they asked</font>

389
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:45,159
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions and we found a number</font>

390
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:46,810
of different bugs and operating systems

391
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and things actually unfortunately</font>

392
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:52,050
regretted and like

393
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:55,710
Mac Mac<font color="#E5E5E5"> OSX on making v6 more</font>

394
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:57,990
transparent<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

395
00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:00,930
see and hopefully these things can

396
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:04,410
actually moved on at into a wider

397
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:06,720
audience not just dannegan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron but</font>

398
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,490
in other audiences and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> venues as</font>

399
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,980
well so we can actually push this even a

400
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:16,260
little bit harder so one of the things

401
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,940
that I'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all kind of</font>

402
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,890
foreshadowing and there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

403
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,960
more to come but look at Project X and

404
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,250
resource certification there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

405
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,600
going to be more there's gonna be more

406
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,030
to you to hell coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

407
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,469
pretty soon and I I really don't want to

408
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,330
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it until we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really have</font>

409
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:33,120
something available for you guys to

410
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,310
actually start to push and play with as

411
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,199
well so so I kind of hold off for my

412
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,760
natural sort of tendency to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

413
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,280
here it is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really cool stuff go</font>

414
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,320
ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it excuse me</font>

415
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,020
when it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really there yet so but</font>

416
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:48,139
that is coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon so thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

417
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,139
much

418
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:56,930
hey one question Danny<font color="#CCCCCC"> Macpherson I was</font>

419
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,310
just wondering mark on the origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> AF</font>

420
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:00,500
stuff for you guys do you have

intentions are going back and populating

422
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:05,060
that to associate those<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Genesis with</font>

423
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:08,180
with existing prefixes because i know

424
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,950
that's a voluntary thing now right<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

425
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,540
still voluntary<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be a</font>

426
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,100
good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion</font>

427
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,139
process if we wanted to do something a

428
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,490
little bit different<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mom but right</font>

429
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:21,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">now we're basically we were using</font>

430
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:24,230
internal version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> reviews to actually</font>

431
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:26,540
validate that the origin ASR checked if

432
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:30,410
or geneious against what we have in

433
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:34,090
either the<font color="#CCCCCC"> irr or within our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whois</font>

434
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:37,940
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you yeah okay on</font>

435
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:39,199
exactly the same issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suggest that we</font>

436
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,680
have a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of technical</font>

437
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,860
discussion on while okay we are

438
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">expecting that the rpki certified</font>

439
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:52,790
routing data will be made available to

440
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">VR psl world and actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much the</font>

441
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:58,850
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas can be applied to your origin</font>

442
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,220
thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it makes a lot</font>

443
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:04,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">of sense to actually have kind of</font>

444
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:08,990
unified view how to how to get the best

445
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:10,490
out of it all yeah I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of referencing</font>

446
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,950
a little bit what Rutgers talking about

447
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:16,610
there's also sort of a movement

448
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:19,280
underfoot to actually see put some

449
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:23,659
security information on our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl is it</font>

450
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,700
and and so he's this is all somewhat

451
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:28,970
controversial and it's all kind of in a

452
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,730
very much a embryonic stage right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so</font>

453
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,530
but there's there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a obviously there's</font>

454
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,120
a lot of thought being put into this and

455
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,340
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to best speak</font>

456
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sure their various regional</font>

457
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:41,030
registries will come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some sort</font>

458
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:43,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">of cohesive solution that will make</font>

459
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,710
sense but i'm not sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is right</font>

460
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:50,780
now because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very much an</font>

461
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:53,080
evolutionary stage so well thank you

462
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much</font>
