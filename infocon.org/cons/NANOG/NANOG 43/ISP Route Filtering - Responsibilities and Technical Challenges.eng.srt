15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,899
are always valuable for years after the

16
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,180
fact and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> testament to the value</font>

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,789
of offering presenters free admission to

18
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,329
nanog because he's a notoriously cheap

19

38
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,039
there'll be detailed discussions about

39
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:43,949
that I'm positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then tis right</font>

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,790
the years and certainly for this nanog

43
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,780
on the security content that we've had

44
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:58,829
here so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciate that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> greatly so</font>

45
00:01:53,780 --> 00:02:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought I do turn it over to Danny so uh</font>

46
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,750
so yeah it was kind of funny because<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

47
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,460
when you know on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube thing came</font>

48
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,500
up and Martin presented this earlier and

49
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,699
and a couple folks are like well let's

50
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,020
have another you know another route

51
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,700
filtering panel I was like well we could

52
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just you know they are KY the video now</font>

53
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,730
so we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just play the video</font>

54
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,680
the last five route filtering panels and

55
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,959
and not actually have to do it again<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh well what will we change with this is</font>

57
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,550
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more focus on you know sort of</font>

58
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,570
white people stopped using IRS and

59
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">stopped going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the route</font>

60
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,660
filtering once the challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and</font>

61
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,670
then dig into some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that are</font>

62
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,829
changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what might make it a little</font>

63
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:33,989
more more little more filling and a

64
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,040
little more useful to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going some</font>

65
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the route filtering stuff in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

66
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,950
kind of so the guys I got here it's a

67
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,200
pretty wide spectrum of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know of</font>

68
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,030
organizations represented right I you

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,260
know some<font color="#E5E5E5"> some I our folks and content</font>

70
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,400
and different providers and someone

71
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,570
that's were in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of tools or a</font>

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,000
couple of folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have written tools</font>

73
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,950
along these lines and so we got a pretty

74
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,420
broad spectrum and this is definitely

75
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,519
meant to be interactive we got a few

76
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,570
slides to kind of set the stage and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

77
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,040
we r you know I got some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

78
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,420
questions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel members</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at any</font>

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,859
point if you got questions or

80
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,959
clarifications you're welcome to n come

81
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:05,360
to the mic<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got in a slightly less</font>

82
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">than an hour now to use for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this um</font>

83
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,500
Larry by the way layer i added<font color="#CCCCCC"> our ask</font>

84
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,700
Larry if he would join us yesterday and

85
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,160
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate him kind of on a whim</font>

86
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,480
stepping up as well as a Warren standing

87
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,130
in for Chris<font color="#E5E5E5"> Murrow who had to leave</font>

88
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,310
early so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate Warren stepping up</font>

89
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,320
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so anyway with that so uh you</font>

90
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,360
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I just said this actually we're</font>

91
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,799
going to talk primarily about um you

92
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,690
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route advertisements and the</font>

93
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,520
contents of these updates themselves and

94
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,350
the prefix is explicitly not really

95
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:34,140
about protecting bgp sessions from das

96
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,190
attacks or from you know from from that

97
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,660
sort of thing so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing</font>

98
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,920
with transport connections so if we're

99
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,280
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about the content and</font>

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,829
prefixes so so you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last 15</font>

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,040
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's changed right um you know</font>

102
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,660
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> still I our data right um you know</font>

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,130
less employment of inner provider

104
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,100
filtering in particular but also

105
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,750
customer filtering um you know still no

106
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,730
verifiable source so one of the one of

107
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term problems that's existed or</font>

108
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:01,170
you know part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chicken and egg</font>

109
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,880
problem is the fact that um that on the

110
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,530
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> right we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these are IRS</font>

111
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,269
and some I n allocated stuff and there's

112
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,430
really no authoritative<font color="#E5E5E5"> formally</font>

113
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,050
verifiable source for who owns what IP

114
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,850
address space so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

115
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,740
things like anti spoofing or if you want

116
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do Ralph filters you know how do you</font>

117
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,100
verify that the content is correct and

118
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,079
hasn't been altered or modified in some

119
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,870
way and what's changing with that so um

120
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,940
a lot more meat computers behind

121
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,250
keyboards right so you know people with

122
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,580
bgp router and able access you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15</font>

123
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,250
years

124
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,810
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be 5,000 now you know you got</font>

125
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,550
maybe five hundred thousand people<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

126
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,080
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> naval access and you know and</font>

127
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore you know the probability of</font>

128
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,270
mistakes in particular is much much

129
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,460
higher<font color="#E5E5E5"> greater reliance on internet</font>

130
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,560
availability I mean you know when Africa

131
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,388
Kenya online you know when went off you

132
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,889
know offline for you know for 22 hours

133
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:48,689
or whatever just after<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube there</font>

134
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,639
wasn't a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of attention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

135
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:52,379
that but when YouTube went offline you

136
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,520
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know we need</font>

137
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,139
the availability of this stuff there

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,818
actually are critical applications that

139
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,740
you know and lots of lots of e-commerce

140
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,940
and money flowing because of internet

141
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,310
availability so it's much more critical

142
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,870
so anyway in summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know things</font>

143
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:06,750
have just got worse than last 15 years

144
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,520
they haven't gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so the IRS</font>

145
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:13,409
what are some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

146
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,810
larry was saying that there are 37 3534

147
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">i are so we have less I ours now just</font>

148
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,240
because ISPs went out of business or I

149
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what were some of the other</font>

150
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,409
reasons for this um yeah primarily ISPs

151
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,789
going out of business or losing interest

152
00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:26,460
they just stopped maintaining their

153
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:28,199
servers and let them die off so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

154
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the primary reason so I mean so</font>

155
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,919
you know so we have less IRS today now

156
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,210
rather than more<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ours and and more</font>

157
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,159
stale data certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll talk some</font>

158
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,539
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that in just a minute you</font>

159
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:39,270
know certainly the fact that they're you

160
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,009
know 35 or 250 I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ards whatever the</font>

161
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,060
number is and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's that's a</font>

162
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:43,949
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> right this is where you</font>

163
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,060
register your route policy and what

164
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:46,289
routes you're going to originate and who

165
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,909
you're going to provide transit or other

166
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:50,250
other routing policy for so that's

167
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:51,930
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> a challenge so perception is</font>

168
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,800
you know the data in the IRS<font color="#CCCCCC"> is useless</font>

169
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">right we're going to get to that in a</font>

170
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,210
minute customer issues so<font color="#CCCCCC"> rüdiger was</font>

171
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,150
actually mentioning something like you

172
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they have customers with with you</font>

173
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">know 20,000 routes and they don't want</font>

174
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:03,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">to register rumor they want to register</font>

175
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:05,430
them in five different places I don't

176
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:11,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you want to expand on that now so</font>

177
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:13,710
we know that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we get to it in a</font>

178
00:06:11,789 --> 00:06:15,029
minute and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine um insecure</font>

179
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,919
update my one of the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> things is that</font>

180
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:18,779
there's no very little security wrapped

181
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,940
around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ir update models right so the</font>

182
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:22,560
fact that um anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> could pretty much go</font>

183
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,360
update any ir anywhere with whatever

184
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,889
prefix and if someone correlates all

185
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,569
this decentralized data and builds

186
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:29,729
policy based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this they don't really</font>

187
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:31,289
apply preference to one ir or another or

188
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:33,960
they had no way to formally verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

189
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:36,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">owns what address space all right tools</font>

190
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,279
to configure the IRS so like Richards

191
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,479
worked on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know Larry has a lot of</font>

192
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,370
ISPs have their own too

193
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,720
and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what's there what's</font>

194
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,480
missing and how you know how can you

195
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,620
improve that enter our communication

196
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,260
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about this a minute ago</font>

197
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,640
timing issues so there there used to be

198
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,080
these issues all the time like you know

199
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:57,120
when as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet mci in 94 where when a</font>

200
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,109
when you added<font color="#E5E5E5"> around a new customer you</font>

201
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,550
turn them off or they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home</font>

202
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:00,990
you start announcing something you would

203
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,310
add it to your registry and we push out

204
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,900
new configs with the tool an update

205
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,910
prefix list and announce the route<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

206
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,349
then everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else was filtering the</font>

207
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,880
route<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so we'd have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to call them up</font>

208
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,380
and say hey can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you know can you</font>

209
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,360
remove your filter then you'd have to

210
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,610
bounce the route because bgp is reliable

211
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,930
transport and it doesn't just resend the

212
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,160
route so you have to balance it but

213
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,840
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about some protocol</font>

214
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,350
stuff there and then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> full route</font>

215
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,580
policy enumeration again you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

216
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:25,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ruettiger brought up where</font>

217
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,349
the fact that like a lot of ISPs for

218
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,390
example in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> russia some of the ISPs</font>

219
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,190
back one another up completely and so

220
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,719
it's like if this link goes down then

221
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,010
you have to list all the other prefixes

222
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,600
in some registry and this guy has a

223
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,300
potential transit provider so people can

224
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,640
build filters on that and then all right

225
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,930
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get past this so I don't</font>

226
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many folks here we're familiar with</font>

227
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nemesis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I went digging for</font>

228
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,659
some stuff one of the things that it was

229
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what sort of the</font>

230
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,750
Delta<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our IR allocations to IRR</font>

231
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,820
object your route object registration to

232
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,740
the routing system and nemesis did some

233
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:01,349
of this stuff and you know ripe was

234
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,730
pretty good a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other data was</font>

235
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,080
challenging either because it was still

236
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,600
and routes were registered or people

237
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,099
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> left them and so forth so you know</font>

238
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,450
some tools to understand these things

239
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,820
and see how we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it cleaned up are</font>

240
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:14,130
important this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a</font>

241
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:16,320
conceptual model where you know where

242
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:17,700
route allocation occurs and you got this

243
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,520
you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this chunk on the right</font>

244
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:22,110
side here the purple stuff doesn't

245
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,580
actually exist yet that's what Mark

246
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">costard was talking about what rüdiger</font>

247
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,659
was talking about earlier it's being

248
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:30,420
developed and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of this rpki</font>

249
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,040
thingy right is this this authoritative

250
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,570
source that's never existed for who

251
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,848
actually owns one who's authorized

252
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">originate what and so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have that</font>

253
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,520
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big part of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chicken and egg</font>

254
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,049
problem and then you can start using

255
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to either provide preference or</font>

256
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,709
provide other things and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

257
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:46,079
know there's a more plausible path to

258
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:49,770
you know to formally verifiable route

259
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,470
filters um so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just says what I just</font>

260
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,150
said some routing protocol issues um

261
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,770
so some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that had changed</font>

262
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">too is you know I was mention you had to</font>

263
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,060
bounce a route when you update it a

264
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,380
policy you had to call someone like we

265
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,089
used to call ANS they would filter all

266
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,680
their peers say hey we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> added this</font>

267
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:06,090
can you can you remove you know or

268
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,069
update your policies based on these new

269
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">IRR objects and they do that and then</font>

270
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,280
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to either reset the session</font>

271
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,380
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer reset sessions with</font>

272
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,939
ANS or literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know announce the</font>

273
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:16,500
more spit I mean announced that prefix

274
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,420
with the more preferred path find some

275
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,660
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bounce the route in BGP so that</font>

276
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,800
there would be no ryu of that update and

277
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,910
you know with things like BGP route

278
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,410
refresh you don't have to do that

279
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,260
anymore there are some implementation

280
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,569
issues and so forth but you know some of

281
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:32,250
these things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were challenges and</font>

282
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're reasons people stopped using IRS</font>

283
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,690
and explicit prefix filtering don't

284
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,640
exist anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that perspective</font>

285
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:41,400
router issues so um you know where do

286
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,650
things break right i mean if you got you

287
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,630
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> two thousand prefixes for our you</font>

288
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">know in an access list for customers</font>

289
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,050
then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be reasonable</font>

290
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,970
but if you have half a<font color="#E5E5E5"> million you know</font>

291
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,620
which which you know is perfectly you

292
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,760
know plausible today then you know is it

293
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,780
going to break your router's<font color="#CCCCCC"> agnello</font>

294
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,730
config you're going to have you know

295
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">ritee issues or config loading or is it</font>

296
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,930
sessions going to reset you know what's

297
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:03,660
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break their so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy language</font>

298
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,760
so if using things like say black hole

299
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,490
communities do you have to define you

300
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,720
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple sets of policies so for</font>

301
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:11,160
example it's like I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transit</font>

302
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,410
these explicit prefixes in these

303
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:15,839
prefixes only and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way if there's</font>

304
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:17,250
a more specific prefix that exists with

305
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,540
this community is going to black hole

306
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,520
that route but I don't want to transit

307
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:22,079
it so you got to define two or three or

308
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,130
four<font color="#CCCCCC"> sets of overlapping policy so how</font>

309
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,890
do you express that and how is it

310
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:27,720
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented processing load</font>

311
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,150
utilization config loads all this stuff

312
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,560
um data pass so can this stuff you know

313
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:33,540
can do you have to duplicate these

314
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,550
routing filters for data path filters

315
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,430
right and if you do now you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

316
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:41,189
the number of of you know amount of

317
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:43,439
configuration or more so and then you

318
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,270
know you know the application<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this so</font>

319
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">if I can figure these things you know</font>

320
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">they immediately applied or is it all</font>

321
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:50,130
loaded and committed at one time and you

322
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:51,660
know and so forth so you don't leak

323
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:53,700
routes or depending on how your policy

324
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,290
is implemented you know it varies

325
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,500
between vendors and so this causes route

326
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,240
stability issues on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

327
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,160
bottlenecks um Richard actually

328
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,000
mentioned I left this place holder in

329
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,959
here but you mentioned it so I don't

330
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to talk for a minute</font>

331
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,410
but

332
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,120
and Tom<font color="#CCCCCC"> shoul had a slide a couple of</font>

333
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,480
nannaogsigurd or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years ago that</font>

334
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:13,460
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about where routers broke</font>

335
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,020
and you know some of the testing that he

336
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,950
did and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

337
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,270
understand right because there are all

338
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,870
these different touch pieces and it's

339
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,880
like if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to actually</font>

340
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,440
implement prefix filtering then you know

341
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,740
where where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the gating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

342
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,120
gates at a general filtering all right

343
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,450
no I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skim past all this</font>

344
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,190
because I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the talking so I</font>

345
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,390
panel and community quest rights and I

346
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:33,560
encourage all of you right if you're

347
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">sitting in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the room you probably care</font>

348
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,920
about some summer out getting high jack

349
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,630
somewhere so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got comments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm</font>

350
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,699
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to direct these two to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the guys at</font>

351
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the table here and see you know see what</font>

352
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,390
the thoughts are with some of these

353
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,520
questions incremental deployment right

354
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:48,380
so if you have things like nemesis to

355
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,689
differ out to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean how stale are the</font>

356
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,240
IR is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically and and what tools and</font>

357
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:55,160
capabilities do you need to you know to

358
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,860
get you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a place where the</font>

359
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:00,980
IRS are feasible to do both customer

360
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:03,380
base and<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter provider of filtering any</font>

361
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,880
comments on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh if Larry or Richard</font>

362
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,880
or anyone's done any analysis on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

363
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:12,410
well i would i would just say that the

364
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,620
current use of IRS is for customer based

365
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,300
filtering so while there is you know

366
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,400
considerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of stale data in</font>

367
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:23,270
there since you're just looking at at

368
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,650
customer peers a lot of that data is not

369
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,500
really relevant you're looking you're

370
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:29,870
looking at a s numbers and doing inverse

371
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:32,089
lookups based on a s numbers so the fact

372
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,730
that there's prefixes registered with

373
00:12:32,089 --> 00:12:36,980
withhold a s numbers isn't terribly

374
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,930
relevant for doing customer filtering

375
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,720
now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if you want to go beyond</font>

376
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:44,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then that's a big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issue but the way</font>

377
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,029
it's being used right now I mean it's

378
00:12:44,779 --> 00:12:49,370
semi functional and you can you can talk

379
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,529
to level<font color="#E5E5E5"> through your sabes I mean those</font>

380
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,610
guys are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it and from their</font>

381
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:58,430
perspective really not common<font color="#CCCCCC"> adequately</font>

382
00:12:55,610 --> 00:13:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">what again see here it works objection</font>

383
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:09,170
your honor<font color="#CCCCCC"> and even even if you even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

384
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:13,300
you just intend to filter based on the

385
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:16,149
reverse a s look up for stale data

386
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:19,779
that people proxy registered with wrong

387
00:13:16,149 --> 00:13:22,300
origin over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last decade that is</font>

388
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:29,290
around a couple of the databases of

389
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:33,819
course is reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for concern but well</font>

390
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I think I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the fact</font>

391
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there are databases out were well</font>

392
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:45,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there is absolutely no security</font>

393
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:49,209
that really that really goes after

394
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:54,130
authenticity and authority well okay and

395
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:58,510
there is back bad practice about putting

396
00:13:54,130 --> 00:14:02,050
stuff in like well okay the party that

397
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:04,990
puts stuff in is some is some

398
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,089
higher-level transit provider who just

399
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:12,390
does lots of proxy stuff and never

400
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:16,870
cleans up of course is of concern and

401
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:21,579
while okay this for me means that while

402
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:24,160
okay when when using the irr data I

403
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:28,180
consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> it an important thing to</font>

404
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,850
actually be very selective if a customer

405
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:34,719
tells me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> while okay he is</font>

406
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:38,680
unfortunately using an routing registry

407
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:40,810
with little security but he tells me

408
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,989
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's the place where I am</font>

409
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,540
actually publishing my stuff and I put

410
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,750
into my database that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for that</font>

411
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:52,930
guy I will be varying exactly that

412
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,480
database and not pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> up all the stuff</font>

413
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:59,439
that is floating around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other how</font>

414
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:03,040
many 50 registries before well okay now

415
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:05,410
whatever of a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I think I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

416
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,810
I think I can argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

417
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:09,760
much more reasonable job than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

418
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:14,768
accepting all the stuff that's around

419
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:16,839
and anyway well now if you are if you

420
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:20,620
are providing if you are providing

421
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:23,910
transit service for just a small number

422
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:27,139
of small customers well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay actually</font>

423
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,589
Larry Larry's approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

424
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:35,480
fine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> well okay if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

425
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:41,299
someone like<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCCW did they occur in</font>

426
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:43,249
recent slides and while okay you are

427
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,129
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> providing you are actually</font>

428
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:49,189
providing service for a large number of

429
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:52,189
prefixes with multiple level of transit

430
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:56,929
in between collecting collecting

431
00:15:52,189 --> 00:16:00,949
collecting the right prefixes out of the

432
00:15:56,929 --> 00:16:04,429
current mess of registries quite

433
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:08,959
certainly is something that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

434
00:16:04,429 --> 00:16:10,100
make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very successful okay so um so I</font>

435
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,839
don't know Richard yeah you want your

436
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,329
comment asthma is so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't actually</font>

437
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,329
done any analysis on how much stale data

438
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:19,219
is out there but in my experience

439
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:21,138
there's a lot of stale data and it comes

440
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">from multiple sources it comes from</font>

441
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:25,339
things like companies that have been

442
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,589
defunct that used to have some IP space

443
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:28,939
had it registered and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP space has</font>

444
00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:30,549
now been reclaimed reassigned to

445
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:33,439
somebody else there's still

446
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,689
registrations for that you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

447
00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:37,429
times now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> asns have been have been</font>

448
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:40,579
reclaimed and recycled there's there's

449
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:42,410
faulty origin information out there so

450
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:44,868
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph's that have absolutely no</font>

451
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:47,169
association<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you there that are</font>

452
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:49,399
floating around in these registries and

453
00:16:47,169 --> 00:16:50,869
probably the biggest one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen</font>

454
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,470
is people that don't clean up there is

455
00:16:50,869 --> 00:16:56,899
sets so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you might have a</font>

456
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,129
large network who has a cousin<font color="#E5E5E5"> who has</font>

459
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,990
they're motivated to put data into the

460
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:07,579
system no one complains when the prefix

461
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,109
list allows too much people complain

462
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:11,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">when the prefix list doesn't allow</font>

463
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:13,490
enough so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routes</font>

464
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:15,829
propagate no one seems to go look in and

465
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,349
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're including a SS for</font>

466
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:21,589
people that are not their customers many

467
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:24,079
orders of magnitude down many many

that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> never going to announce and</font>

476
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,559
there is no process to go clean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up</font>

477
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,000
and then when you take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

478
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,500
number of registries that are out there

00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:52,330
proxy registration for me for routes

484
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,880
might announce a more specific and

485
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,280
someone picks it up and proxy registers

486
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,960
it for me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had to send many many</font>

487
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,549
emails to people and say knock it off

488
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,020
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of people that don't know</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that things are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being proxy registered</font>

490
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,960
for them don't know that things are

00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">being proxy registered four or five</font>

492
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,080
times and there's some people that will

493
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,730
proxy register without actually checking

494
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:15,189
to see if their route exists there or

495
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,200
not so you literally will find all these

496
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,480
different ISPs especially many of them

497
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,010
running their own I are our servers that

498
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,770
go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just populate data however</font>

499
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:26,260
they willy-nilly want and there there's

500
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:31,710
no accountability for that data go ahead

501
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:35,290
talk to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question Lou</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

502
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:37,570
Todd Underwood Renesys so i think it was

503
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,730
yesterday or the day before when my

504
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:42,340
colleague martin was talking about the l

505
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">route nonsense one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

506
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,299
proposed not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> very great detail was</font>

507
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:50,470
that the root server operators operate a

508
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:53,110
very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> rir for the root prefixes</font>

509
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,299
which would contain you know the routing

510
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:58,149
policy for what<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s should I mean we</font>

511
00:18:55,299 --> 00:19:00,520
found it surprisingly difficult to find

512
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,950
any official documentation I we never

513
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,450
found any official documentation on what

514
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,790
a SS should originate which route

515
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,280
prefixes and what are the authorized up

516
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,889
streams or peers or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> left-hand</font>

517
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,830
side a SS for those do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys think</font>

518
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,690
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is that a would that help be</font>

519
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,730
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a reasonable thing to do see</font>

520
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,799
will any root server operators actually

521
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,990
do that so you want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about our</font>

522
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">pki or about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the I where do you wanna go</font>

523
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this yeah well okay kind of well</font>

524
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:37,120
creating another while<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay going from n</font>

525
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:42,760
registries 2n plus 1 were well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

526
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:45,010
this new one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low-key</font>

527
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:51,010
having really nice data and well cared

528
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:53,680
for one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it could help but while</font>

529
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:58,990
okay is it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually is it actually</font>

530
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,940
a way for a reasonable forward so<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon</font>

531
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:02,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">as she's a woman I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asked my along these</font>

532
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,000
lines actually is if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this extra</font>

533
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,620
registry it is another registry if

534
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,180
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an authoritative source for</font>

535
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,449
who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> authorized to originate which</font>

536
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:12,490
prefixes then um people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to define</font>

537
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:14,170
implicit models where they deny those

538
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:16,210
prefixes you know like these golden

539
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,679
networks or platinum prefixes or you

540
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,720
have to deny those from everyone else

541
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,790
and just accept them from you know

542
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,170
rather than an explicit sort of you know

543

<font color="#E5E5E5">security model for round announcements</font>

544
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,710
which says these are the exploit you

545
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,570
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the explicit prefixes I'm</font>

546
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:30,700
accepting from these origin a esas and

547
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm denying everything else and so I</font>

548
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,100
don't know what are you know what are

549
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,929
sort of thoughts on you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

550
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,050
golden prefixes or doing things in the

551
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:41,170
interim<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yeah please yeah well okay I</font>

552
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:46,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I think I think for really going</font>

553
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:51,210
forward and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just trying to fix fix</font>

554
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:57,240
vo<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old globe by applying applying</font>

555
00:20:51,210 --> 00:21:01,059
square foot patches actually actually

556
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:05,070
the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> of well okay how can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we how</font>

557
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:09,190
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to a storage of good data</font>

558
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:12,250
that everybody who cares<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and cares</font>

00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:16,420
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> his address space can use to</font>

deposit the authorization information

561
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:23,980
and everybody who cares to run a clean

562
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:31,740
network can actually go and pick it up

563
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">and assuming assuming we would have such</font>

564
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:41,600
storage<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay actually actually what</font>

565
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:45,830
Danny was saying is we get gets gets

566
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:49,040
possible namely to actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

567
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:53,530
origin validation by filtering even

between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the higher higher tier pairings</font>

569
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:59,840
now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course of course if all the</font>

570
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,910
hundred thousand roots that really

571
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,820
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in the routing system get</font>

572
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:08,780
registered we will put some strain on

573
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,310
the rooters<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the Rooter configuration</font>

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,270
in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> but well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's not</font>

575
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:16,730

576
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,730
overall overall looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

577
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,820
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think for getting good routing</font>

578
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:25,070
security well okay there are two

579
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,530
preconditions one is to have good<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

580
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:29,870
where while okay everybody knows to

581
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,970
store the stuff everybody knows to read

582
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,000
it and while okay there are also tools

583
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,940
to access it the second point is well

584
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,100
okay in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> really secure routing</font>

585
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,770
will only happen when we get security

586
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:45,709
elements in the routing protocol as long

587
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">as we are not there well okay we are</font>

588
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:53,210
emulating the stuff approximating this

589
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:57,410
by creating more complex policies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

590
00:22:53,210 --> 00:23:00,230
routing and while okay if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get good</font>

591
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:05,240
data while okay we can feed the policies

592
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:07,280
to do it so to shift gears slightly you

593
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">know I would I would posit I guess or</font>

594
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,000
you know say say that every ISP today

595
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,550
there's there's no excuse for why you

596
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,780
shouldn't explicitly filter what route

597
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:16,970
announcement I mean what announcement

598
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,000
your customers what prefixes your

599
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:21,350
customers announced to you so you when

600
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,490
we discussed this yesterday right it's

601
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,230
like you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so if you</font>

602
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,370
generate this based on IRS and it's

603
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,780
somebody that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home who's</font>

604
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,969
registered they use all these sort of

605
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,560
things but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that you know a basic</font>

606
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:32,060
responsibility of every ISP today is

607
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,800
that they should at least filter their

608
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,679
customers so what are what are thoughts

609
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:39,800
on that start over with Richard well

610
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:42,440
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should and the problem is</font>

611
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:45,560
at hand is why aren't they and there's

612
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,210
plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of excuses why you there's plenty</font>

613
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,990
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons why things are difficult to</font>

614
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:53,900
do at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day the answer is</font>

615
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,430
you have to do it you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it no</font>

616
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,110
matter how hard it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and if there's a</font>

617
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,450
problem with with doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then that's a</font>

618
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:01,240
problem you need to solve but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

619
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:03,830
same time I can name any number of

620
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,720
networks out there who are both my peers

621
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:08,780
and in one case even a transit provider

622
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:11,630
who doesn't prefix filter me they max

623
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,889
filter me I could announce anything I

624
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,410
want and probably get it propagated

625
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,510
right now and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably true for a</font>

626
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,830
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font>

627
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:22,400
Larry you have any any thoughts on that

628
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:25,490
from well I think it's it's clear that

629
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,340
some of the tools out there aren't are

630
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:31,040
far too complex that I our tool set to

631
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,300
name one it requires quite a bit of

632
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,080
effort to get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up and working</font>

633
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:39,590
and the the registry systems are fairly

634
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:41,060
complicated for the RIT be we have a we

635
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,129
have a web front-end but it's still more

636
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:44,929
complex than we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like it to be and I'm</font>

637
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:46,940
sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complex than our users</font>

638
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,530
would like it to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> him part of the</font>

639
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue is we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not really sure where I</font>

640
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,340
RS are going and we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

641
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:54,260
gotten a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feedback and three or</font>

642
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,570
four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago people were fairly</font>

643
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,150
certain within merit that they were

644
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:01,790
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to die off that this sob GP and SP</font>

645
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:03,980
GP stuff was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

646
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:05,960
people weren't going to use IRS anymore

647
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,340
so there wasn't a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of investment put</font>

648
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:13,400
in into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RIT be or the IRR system so</font>

649
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,020
I think there needs to be some decision

650
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">going forward do we want to continue to</font>

651
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,420
use IRS on an interim basis should there

652
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a you know our pricing right now for</font>

653
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:24,920
the RIT be we do charge 250 a year but

654
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,480
that's just for keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server's up</font>

655
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,630
maintaining the software it doesn't

656
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,790
allow a lot of development in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

657
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,190
user interfaces and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

658
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,899
you know we could increase the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fees but</font>

659
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,390
then then you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose customers</font>

660
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,680
so it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring in</font>

661
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,100
much revenue if you want to do

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:44,630
enhancements<font color="#E5E5E5"> um Warren what are your</font>

663
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:47,360

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> any notion of including and like</font>

666
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:52,420

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> phils you to do peering or involved</font>

668
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,830
with the agreements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your you know</font>

669
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,970
your peers must explicitly filter

670
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,500
customers you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> really no way to</font>

671
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,170
verify that until somebody screw

672
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,660
something up but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> worn both on</font>

673
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:07,120
on both those questions on do you think

674
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,500
it's reasonable to say that if an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP</font>

675
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,300
doesn't filter their customers

676
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,010
explicitly today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I realize most of</font>

677
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,200
you know accidents happen but you think

678
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:16,000
it's reasonable to say that every ISP

679
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,860
should filter their customers well it's

680
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">really hard to get customers to put</font>

681
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,479
information into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IRS and registering</font>

682
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,429
the information for them serve proxy

683
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,260
registering doesn't really gain you

684
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:28,690
anything because when a customer calls

685
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:30,190
up and says this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> my space there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

686
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,210
way to buy the day that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really is</font>

687
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:35,770
there space you know this used to belong

690
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:44,350
back to that egg party looking this sue

<font color="#CCCCCC">a central authority for know when I mean</font>

692
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:48,429
you sort of have to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the threat</font>

694
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,630

00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about Authority models and well</font>

696
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,610
there's really no authority for

697
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:59,200
registering these prefixes but I don't

698
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:01,330
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a huge concern you know</font>

699
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,730
having somebody go out and prove

700
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,990
something and register something to try

701
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:07,810
to hijack it you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really see that</font>

702
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:11,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the main threat model is preventing</font>

705
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:17,020
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say oh we can't we can't</font>

706
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,850
register we shouldn't register because

707
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:21,190
there's no authority my life I think

708
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,600
that's kind of dodging the issue at this

709
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:26,020
point I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean once you get to the point</font>

710
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:28,629
where you have more registrations and a

711
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:30,610
better system then you clearly need to

712
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">focus on that but I don't I don't really</font>

713
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,560
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a valid excuse for not</font>

714
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,300
registering that Richard what you have

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know people are horrified by this</font>

but if you're just looking at preventing

those accidental hijacks you know it

719

724
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,180
going to register an irr because what

00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:00,929
the hell is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use it</font>

726
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:02,730
right so that one

727
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:04,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">I did want to do is put in a plug for a</font>

734
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,720
started from scratch and wrote an

00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:28,320
I did an anti presentation on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if</font>

level I've got tier ones using this and

744
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:48,000
they come to me for questions sometimes

745
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:49,740
and I try to fix the software I've got

746
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,780
very small I species in this and it

747
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,060
seems to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> relatively well and it</font>

748
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:57,060
combines the aspects of automating

749
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:59,070
pulling down the prefix lists sorting

750
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,250
them aggregating them running them

751
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:04,530
against known bogans that you want to

<font color="#E5E5E5">exclude tracking changes over time so</font>

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,700
foundry forest and etc etc extreme and

759
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:22,230
even some hooks to help tie that into

760
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,780
your back-end databases and then push

761
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:26,850
those routes out so it's the best

762
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,710
starting point that I've got to offer

763
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,959
and I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changes so</font>

764
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,570
anyone that that runs that has any

765
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,740
suggestions please submit them but

766
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:36,450
otherwise i would encourage anyone

767
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,860
that's not filtering their customers to

768
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,680
at least try this because it's really

769
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple ok so let's go to David then went</font>

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked every ISP knows who their</font>

774
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,760
customers are because they're because

775
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,770
they're receiving checks from them so

776
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,150
there they have a valid set of contact

777
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:00,030
information they have a valid set of

778
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:03,930
something some way to contact them and

779
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:06,480
if if the ISPs run their own server that

780
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:09,420
then we'll say at least here's who we

781
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,400
are here to our<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers are then at</font>

provides an incremental benefit

first to Warren while okay Warren<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

797
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:54,760
said well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's impossible to</font>

798
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:56,950
actually check well there is a

799
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:02,289
difference between very expensive and

800
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:05,289
impossible and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay of course of</font>

801
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:09,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">course of course expensive is something</font>

802
00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:15,129
that we usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not like to do and</font>

803
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:19,539
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the more interesting thing is</font>

804
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:21,970
well okay can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually can we</font>

805
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:25,870
actually enforce that really things get

806
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:28,480
registered<font color="#E5E5E5"> and while okay if someone</font>

807
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:31,689
actually has his own address space that

808
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,240
he<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously is using ti well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

809
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:38,640
actually we have to tell the community

810
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:42,250
that running p I has its costs and

811
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:46,539
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually if you want to run p I</font>

812
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:48,730
and be secured from hijacking well okay

813
00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:53,799
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to pay</font>

814
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:55,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if if you are if</font>

815
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:58,900
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a dentist and have your</font>

816
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:01,809
expertise in a different field well okay

817
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:06,220
you may eat you may need to actually get

818
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:10,770
someone who for a charge or whatever

819
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:14,860
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes takes care of the thing</font>

820
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:18,520
so within my environment actually

821
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:21,908
actually I'm kind of used to say well

822
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,450
okay at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least well okay our main focus</font>

823
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:27,590
is still on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> European</font>

824
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:30,049
market there it actually works to tell

825
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:32,120
someone who comes up and says please

826
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:35,899
route this address space we tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

827
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:39,049
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay get it we will we will be fine</font>

828
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:41,658
if you prepare the authorization within

829
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:44,750
verizon registry so that we actually

830
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:47,809
have it registered and if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

831
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:52,669
possible well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's not possible to</font>

832
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:55,970
get it rooted um well okay i<font color="#E5E5E5"> am back in</font>

833
00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:58,519
the back office as an architect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

834
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,260
quite happy we have other departments

835
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,260
that do the front and handling of

836
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:07,429
customers and while okay obviously

837
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:10,129
obviously providing a helping hand some

838
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:12,740
in some way there may be a very

839
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:15,590
important requirement for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current</font>

840
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:20,690
situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> and very likely for any</font>

841
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:24,889
upcoming new situation okay so so far

842
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:27,529
for the checking of authority and<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

843
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:29,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay things get really interesting with</font>

844
00:33:27,529 --> 00:33:32,389
the authority when you actually have

845
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:37,459
multi level of customers and that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

846
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:42,110
actually 1.44 for Dave well okay I may

847
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:45,169
know my immediate Russian customer but

848
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:48,709
what well do I know about all the

849
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:51,980
Russian providers that obviously our reg

850
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:55,840
are providing mutual transit for fall

851
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:59,539
back I have no way to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

852
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,090
unless on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the leaf of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

853
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:05,000
structure things are registered and if

854
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:08,719
that happens in a way that I can pull

855
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,569
out I can I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can I can install filters</font>

856
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:14,049
and while okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the filters comes</font>

857
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:16,940
with a cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having the right towards</font>

858
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:21,710
making them operational and actually

859
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:25,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">using them okay ever ever ever other</font>

860
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:25,300
topic larry was

861
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:37,259

00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:46,859
agree a lot on it and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a</font>

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,349
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting question whether</font>

while okay anybody who isn't doing the

867
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:55,050
right thing at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment should spend</font>

868

873
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:16,109
of secure routing is to have good data

874
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,259
in a place where everybody knows to

875
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:24,290
store it there and everybody knows to

876
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:26,760
pull it couple of years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> efforts in</font>

877
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:30,480
working in working on providing

finished and become available and

00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:55,859
looking closely at what information will

basic I our route origination

information how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that change the</font>

911
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,660
equation I mean is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it then reasonable to</font>

912
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,310
expect everyone to filter everyone else

913
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:06,200
and I mean does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that change</font>

914
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:07,820
your perspective it was was already

915
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,410
along the lines that they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be but</font>

916
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,850
you know does that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like a game</font>

917
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:12,859
change to me it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the fact that</font>

918
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:14,450
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to exist and it's never</font>

919
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,520
existed before provides a huge

920
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:18,770
infrastructure that that enables this so

921
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:21,140
comments on them currently I've had

922
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:23,000
cases where I pulled up an ISP and said

923
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,879
this is my space i'm going to announce

924
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,250
it and they say is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really your space</font>

925
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,900
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say yes and they say okay no</font>

926
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,270
worries<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll announce it for you no</font>

927
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:35,000
worries it's the three-phase

928
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:37,430
verification I<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you okay if I could</font>

929
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,990
say this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my space</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they say oh</font>

930
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,669
look we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing that says it</font>

931
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,859
isn't your space so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

932
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:45,530
believe you that would definitely change

933
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,730
the game and you know the tool sets

934
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:49,130
obviously right<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that have</font>

935
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:50,840
existed for IRS and like Richard stuff

936
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:52,100
for example I mean all these things

937
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,690
should be automated right this shouldn't

938
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,069
be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a manual process and</font>

939
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,720
somebody has to type it in or I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

940
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:58,340
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of free stuff out there to</font>

941
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,930
do this one of the big challenges is

942
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,460
like the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure so so what</font>

943
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">about your router's today you know any</font>

944
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you want to comment on you know on on</font>

945
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,550
what your router vendors should be doing

946
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,480
to get ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this if this is really</font>

947
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change the game and allow</font>

948
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,870
people to filter you know how skeptical

949
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:14,779
argue that you can even implement this

950
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:16,400
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy today well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personally</font>

951
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,350
think that the router vendors at this

952
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,110
point should have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of protocol</font>

953
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:23,690
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be efficiently loading these prefixes</font>

954
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:26,440
short of us writing silly expect scripts

955
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:28,880
log into routers to push these changes

956
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,320
the needs to happen at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> point it</font>

957
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,140
needs to be more efficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how it's</font>

958
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:37,250
loaded and how its processed but but

959
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:39,170
even if you have our pki implementation

960
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:41,000
like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I've never had anyone come</font>

961
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,070
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and say well I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do I are</font>

962
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,750
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really that secure people can't</font>

963
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,940
figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and that's the bottom line</font>

964
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:49,760
if we've designed a system that is so

965
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:51,620
complicated that we can't get people to

966
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,050
generate a list of the prefixes they're

967
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:57,319
going to announce how hard is this it's

968
00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:59,240
a list of numbers it's a short list of

969
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,670
numbers you associate it with your a s

970
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,040
and then your ISP associate your AAS

971
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:05,510
with their a s how hard is this how<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

972
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,580
we designed a protocol that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so nasty</font>

973
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:09,800
that a significant percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

974
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,529
population can't figure this out so how

975
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:13,430
do you change that then how do you mean

976
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,510
it's that's one of the fundamental

977
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,460
issues if people aren't going to

978
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:18,140
implement based on this then how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

979
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,090
change that I think the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes</font>

980
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,330
from we've written a policy language

981
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,550
that allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to specify anything and</font>

982
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:27,680
everything and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so complex that no</font>

983
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,930
one's willing to take on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge</font>

984
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,640
of handling any part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

985
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,250
have to handle every possible case of it

986
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,710
and my point would be to develop

987
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:38,510
software the way that I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> with ir rpt</font>

988
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:41,420
which is only address the common use

989
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,620
case my common use case is i have routes

990
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:45,230
their associated with an autonomic

991
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,150
sociated with an ASL down and generate

992
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:50,240
prefixes that's it I don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

993
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:51,890
describe every local policy every<font color="#E5E5E5"> med</font>

00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,830
what people that I've talked to

997
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,810
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the u.s. don't want to do</font>

998

better<font color="#CCCCCC"> front end system into that there</font>

00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:15,850
it sends an email and to the technical

00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:18,740
contact and I get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and I respond</font>

Submit Howard can this be well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1009
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,760
pointing back to Larry's question how

1010
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:38,360
much sense does it make to spend effort

1011
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:43,070
on routing registry stuff I would say

1012
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:46,370
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay are spending effort in in in</font>

1013
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:51,740
improving<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user interface to vr p SL</font>

1015
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,129
challenge

1016
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:59,120
to go after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people who are</font>

1017
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:04,010
installing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki and building the</font>

1018
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:08,390
interfaces for service providers and in

00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:15,890
the end customers for wretches<font color="#CCCCCC"> for for</font>

for creating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new secure data looking</font>

1021
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:23,480
at the long time people have spent in

1022
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:27,020
building the rpki we can see dealing

1023
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:29,660
with all of this is a challenge but well

1024
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:32,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only the only</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the only reasonable way forward for</font>

1026
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:39,400
getting getting better is to make sure

1027
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:43,580
that the chance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good data</font>

1028
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:48,320
gets support by adequate user interfaces

1029
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:50,720
and well okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think Danny you started</font>

1030
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:55,580
with the question well okay what<font color="#E5E5E5"> uptake</font>

1031
00:41:50,720 --> 00:42:00,109
can we expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the rpki stuff and well</font>

1032
00:41:55,580 --> 00:42:03,549
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would i well okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i think</font>

1033
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:07,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will not have any uptake if the data</font>

1034
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:10,100
doesn't get used immediately because

1035
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:13,190
nobody will will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be willing to go</font>

1036
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:15,740
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pain of doing it if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1037
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:22,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">no immediate benefit like seeing the</font>

1038
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:25,939
damned graphics rooted and while okay so

1039
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:28,160
kind of kind of waiting until the

1040
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:31,940
routing protocols can actually take make

1041
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,520
use of it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will wait until</font>

1042
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,260
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a via chicken and egg</font>

1043
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,670
problem so let me let me stop you let me

1044
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,550
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this question to your point is</font>

1045
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:43,010
is there any isp out there that would

1046
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say if this are pika I'm rpki have</font>

1047
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:46,850
structure exists i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

1048
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,770
filtering my peers based on this and you

1049
00:42:46,850 --> 00:42:51,319
won't get routed on my network if you

1050
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:54,830
don't register your house with a very

small<font color="#E5E5E5"> enhancement</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would I I actually</font>

1052
00:42:54,830 --> 00:43:03,200
would like to start a public conspiracy

1053
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:05,169
that's well okay we figure out a simple

1054
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to</font>

1055
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:11,469
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to indicate that while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1056
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:14,449
not only they have done their rpki road

1057
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:18,410
registration but for this part of the

1058
00:43:14,449 --> 00:43:22,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">address space actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the RPK oops the</font>

1059
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:25,578
rpki is the only operative sauce right

1060
00:43:22,219 --> 00:43:29,559
if say our friends at Google register

1061
00:43:25,579 --> 00:43:31,969
their stuff this way and Citibank

1062
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:34,819
figures out they care for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

1063
00:43:31,969 --> 00:43:37,969
space and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what okay some other people</font>

1064
00:43:34,819 --> 00:43:40,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">and well okay maybe they actually care</font>

1065
00:43:37,969 --> 00:43:43,069
as much about the address space to go

1066
00:43:40,189 --> 00:43:45,469
through some tape pain to register<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1067
00:43:43,069 --> 00:43:48,288
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be I would be I would be quite</font>

1068
00:43:45,469 --> 00:43:51,739
certainly willing to do a rich in

1069
00:43:48,289 --> 00:43:54,439
validation and I would expect that some

1070
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:57,439
of the other major networks probably

1071
00:43:54,439 --> 00:43:59,420
will join me Richard well the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that</font>

1072
00:43:57,439 --> 00:44:03,529
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> make is the origin validation</font>

1073
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:05,479
only has a limited viability it solves a

1074
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:08,749
certain problem it solves a problem of

1075
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:11,569
accidental redistribution of a route but

1076
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:15,019
it's trivial to spoof the origin is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1077
00:44:11,569 --> 00:44:16,999
your AAS path it consider the scenario

00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:18,799
where I'm sprint and i'm peering with

1079

level three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i receive a route for</font>

1080
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:23,929
youtube and it and that route could have

1081
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:25,339
come from google<font color="#E5E5E5"> who then buys who</font>

1082
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:27,859
serves youtube it could have come from

1083
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:29,959
someone else behind level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three when you</font>

1084
00:44:27,859 --> 00:44:31,578
get to this high<font color="#CCCCCC"> level of tier one's</font>

1085
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:34,578
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tier ones you really don't</font>

1086
00:44:31,579 --> 00:44:36,349
know what's the full path on this and

1087
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:39,469
social validation only buys you so much

1088
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:41,420
yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would submit that if one large is</font>

1089
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:43,279
p 1 tier one that provides trans and has

1090
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:45,859
lots of good connectivity said<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna</font>

1091
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:48,529
filter<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone explicitly based on rpki</font>

00:44:45,859 --> 00:44:49,279
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i are data right and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

1093
00:44:48,529 --> 00:44:50,390
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you didn't get</font>

1094
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,410
connectivity through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

1095
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:53,569
everyone would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to register</font>

1096
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,368
everything and then the routing system

1097
00:44:53,569 --> 00:44:57,439
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> more scared you're sure but</font>

1098
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:59,119
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> p is gonna do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

1099
00:44:57,439 --> 00:45:00,439
no that's that's a good question<font color="#CCCCCC"> selves</font>

1100
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,999
in the header third<font color="#CCCCCC"> rüdiger say you</font>

1101
00:45:00,439 --> 00:45:04,160
would do some of that actually well well

1102
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:11,479
well the thing is the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font>

1103
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:14,449
is if we if we if we find find a way and

1104
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:16,669
i'm sure it's pretty easy to actually

1105
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:17,700
have parties who care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your address</font>

1106
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:23,340
space

1107
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:27,240
and yeah to indicate that they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

1108
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:31,250
the full registration allowing allowing

1109
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:35,370
everybody to do the origin validation

1110
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:39,870
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay will not will not remove all</font>

1111
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:42,870
the other fake<font color="#CCCCCC"> roots but it helps to</font>

1112
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:45,569
eliminate the fake roots like the

1113
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:49,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube event and Richard I completely</font>

1114
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:53,370
agree with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes this is an idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1115
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:57,000
is easily undermined on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

1116
00:45:53,370 --> 00:46:01,380
again well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to have true</font>

1117
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,560
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need the protocol for for</font>

1118
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:07,410
the time until we get there we have to

1119
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:14,970
work with yer istics and approximations

1120
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:17,190
and I think I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I think offering a</font>

1121
00:46:14,970 --> 00:46:19,770
way for people who care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about their</font>

1122
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:23,280
address space will help and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

1123
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">it immediately can help our d</font>

1124
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:29,130
aggregation problem because one of the

1125
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:31,410
arguments we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people say we are</font>

1126
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:34,590
d aggregating to the longest prefix

1127
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:38,509
possible is because they say we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1128
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:42,020
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get hijacked if we install</font>

1129
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:44,910
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> edition this way well ok</font>

1130
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:50,460
actually the origin validation will say

1131
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:53,879
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok this / 20 is it nothing longer</font>

1132
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:56,960
will be accepted from anybody Fred well

1133
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:00,120
ok now it may it may be it may be that

1134
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:05,760
lots of service providers don't do the

1135
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:09,060
protection but well<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok some parts some</font>

1136
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,640
parts can do and well okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1137
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:14,580
guess in the long run actually the

1138
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:17,970
parties who care will actually prove up

1139
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:20,390
will actually kind well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok give some</font>

1140
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:24,839
benefits back to those parties who are

1141
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:26,790
creating a more secure internet so let's

1142
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,590
take a couple of questions then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got</font>

1143
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:30,660
one more question about this so

1144
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:33,420
they might say it on please Daniel<font color="#E5E5E5"> Deena</font>

1145
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,410
so I a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this sounds like a lot of</font>

1146
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,140
discussion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on with</font>

1147
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:39,089
anti-spam efforts where you had people

1148
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:40,650
publishing their SPF records where you

1149
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,000
have this is my domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these are the</font>

1150
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:44,490
IP addresses that are allowed to send

1151
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,860
trap mail traffic front and there you

1152
00:47:44,490 --> 00:47:49,649
did have a big provider AOL who had the

1153
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:51,270
you know who put pressure along with

1154
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:53,820
some other is to get people to publish

1155
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:55,140
those records and maybe one interesting

1156
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,720
feature there was that you had the

1157
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">option</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you could have a soft fail and</font>

1158
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:01,560
a hard fail where when you're publishing

1159
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:03,930
your information it's informational or

1160
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:06,180
its or its absolute right and and then

1161
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:07,140
you use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a way to decide what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1162
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:08,819
want to do that's one of the things

1163
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:11,490
actually sort of illustrated in this

1164
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:13,020
diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you apply preference be</font>

1165
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:14,520
it you know some local prep thing or

1166
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,470
something else to<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that have</font>

1167
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:19,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">registered their routes and and you can</font>

1168
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:20,370
verify based on that so so I agree you

1169
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,380
know I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the analogy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1170
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:24,120
making in and in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind it takes one of</font>

1171
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,320
the big ISPs to step up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say I'm</font>

1172
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,790
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yell once this infrastructure</font>

1173
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,320
is in place I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1174
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:29,730
have the tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mechanisms and I'm</font>

1175
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:31,650
gonna filter because my customers going

1176
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be more secure and if I filter you</font>

1177
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:36,810
based on if bilaterally we engage in

1178
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:38,370
this filtering and you're more secure

1179
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,410
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> more secure from that you know</font>

1180
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:42,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's incremental gain in this and so</font>

1181
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:44,040
the head way that was made there makes

1182
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:46,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">me wonder is it was spam more serious</font>

1183
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drowned hijacking or why you know</font>

1184
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:50,250
why is the lack of traction it's you

1185
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:52,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's it is partly waited till I</font>

1186
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:53,640
collapse you publish MX records so

1187
00:48:52,110 --> 00:48:55,650
publishing a txt record isn't such a big

1188
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:56,460
headache but advertising routes you

1189
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,410
don't actually have the tool

1190
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:01,160
infrastructure to do you know to publish

1191
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,149
your information easily so um Oh

1192
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,620
commentator let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be brief with</font>

1193
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:06,060
comments because we had about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

1194
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,029
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> left and I want to take these</font>

1195
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:11,390
last two questions but let's root<font color="#CCCCCC"> gerdes</font>

1196
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:13,800
warns might want to respond to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1197
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:17,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">wonder i know is that it lets you know</font>

1198
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:20,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead if a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question was well okay do</font>

1199
00:49:17,850 --> 00:49:22,920
we have a way to actually publish a good

1200
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:26,910
information yes we r PK i will be either

1201
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:30,630
way and we have and we have and we know

1202
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:34,220
how to translate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RPK i think so that</font>

1203
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:37,430
we get it available for reading by the

1204
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,520
existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> psl based tools</font>

1205
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:44,450
I agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over there is no</font>

1206
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:46,490
name please stratum from NIST we are

1207
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:49,250
doing a project at NIST currently where

1208
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:52,759
we are looking at both registry data as

1209
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:57,710
well as trace data from route we use and

1210
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:59,960
writer is I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to emphasize the</font>

1211
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:02,990
importance of completeness and

1212
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,940
consistency in the registries we are

1213
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:07,359
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that data from the point of</font>

1214
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:12,260
view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how algorithms would perform</font>

1215
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:15,020
earlier today PG<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp was mentioned faz</font>

1216
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:17,210
was mentioned so and and emesis was

1217
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:20,180
mentioned so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking all those</font>

1218
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:22,280
different kinds of algorithms and doing

1219
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:24,259
some enhancements on them and also

1220
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:27,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at a hybrid algorithm which</font>

1221
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,930
makes use of both the registry data and

1222
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:32,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">also the historical data so what we are</font>

1223
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">finding is that yesterday I gave a talk</font>

1224
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:38,930
incidentally in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rnd session the</font>

1225
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:42,009
topic was BGP anomaly detection and

1226
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:44,720
robustness algorithms so the primary

1227
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:49,309
thrust in the talk was to be able to do

1228
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:51,529
the the prefix origin validation and in

1229
00:50:49,309 --> 00:50:53,920
order to do that what we find is that

1230
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:58,700
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best of the registries for</font>

1231
00:50:53,920 --> 00:51:00,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">example right rir and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I are ours if you</font>

1232
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,140
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at like we looked at six months</font>

1233
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,450
worth of history data and took all the

1234
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,160
prefix origins from there and if you

1235
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:09,230
want if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the question what</font>

1236
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,410
percentage of them are registered and

1237
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:13,730
first of all what percentage of them are

1238
00:51:11,410 --> 00:51:17,420
stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and water what seemed to be</font>

1239
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:20,030
unstable we based on a 48-hour stability

1240
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:21,770
criteria we determined that ninety two

1241
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:24,140
percent are stable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and about eight</font>

1242
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:26,059
percent are unstable<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will vary</font>

1243
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:27,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">depending on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what data you pick but the</font>

1244
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:30,079
key point I want to make is once you

1245
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">look they separate that into stable and</font>

1246
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,809
unstable prefix origin pairs and then

1247
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,380
you look at the registry right r is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1248
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:43,700
ripe ir r and r<font color="#CCCCCC"> ir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

1249
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:46,040
registries better than the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1250
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:48,379
registries so we went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

1251
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,600
basically what we find is that the

1252
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:51,590
stable prefixes

1253
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,930
seventy-five percent of them are

1254
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:56,150
registered and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five percent are</font>

1255
00:51:53,930 --> 00:52:00,290
not registered and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

1256
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:03,700
unstable prefixes can you wrap it up yes

1257
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:07,640
sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay look at me unstable with these</font>

1258
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:10,310
prefixes and they're like about what ten

1259
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,779
percent of them are registered so so

1260
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,620
variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think this is</font>

1261
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually I think this is really</font>

1262
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:16,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting data it's pretty important</font>

1263
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,660
people start doing policy on this so if

1264
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:20,180
you have pointers or something maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1265
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,830
nanog list or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like but I I think</font>

1266
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:23,779
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really interesting because you</font>

1267
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before people implement policy and</font>

1268
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:27,440
drop you know drop clauses or whatever

1269
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,940
based on this data then they're gonna

1270
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,140
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what the you know</font>

1271
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,190
what the characteristics is it what's

1272
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,900
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they going to break if they</font>

1273
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:34,640
employ policy like this so i think

1274
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,980
that's that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important so yeah I</font>

1275
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,049
think it will help to be RPG I and

1276
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:40,760
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be done to improve the</font>

1277
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,070
quality of the registries will greatly

1278
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:45,560
help these algorithms great thank you so

1279
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:48,740
Brian you get like you know 30 seconds

1280
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:50,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your point and then Tony or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

1283
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,370
preference is a very powerful tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1284
00:52:54,770 --> 00:53:00,950
it provides a great level of granularity

1285
00:52:57,370 --> 00:53:03,109
250 plus levels of granularity yes

1286
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:06,169
instead of filtering out to completely

1287
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:08,990
drop a number of different levels of

1288
00:53:06,170 --> 00:53:12,350
local preference could be applied where

1289
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:15,709
the hot the best is rpki next best would

1290
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:18,589
be ripe etc etc based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> where filtering</font>

1291
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:22,580
information comes from if everybody were

1292
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:25,220
to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now and based on even</font>

1293
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:27,500
empty filters if it falls through to the

1294
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,480
end and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just simply lower the local</font>

1295
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,850
preference that creates an incentive for

1296
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,350
everybody to register because

1297
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:39,080
registering that anywhere will provide

1298
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:41,480
some kind of defense against leakage or

1299
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,910
hijacking because if it's being leaked

1300
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,180
and it's not matching a registration it

1301
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:48,799
gets lower local preference throughout

1302
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:50,810
the the one argument to that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

1303
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,220
it's a more specific but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree in</font>

1304
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,779
general with you of its same prefix

00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,770
linkedin<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's leaked I I completely</font>

1306
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:56,990
agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1307
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,980
some of the rpki stuff is like provide

1308
00:53:56,990 --> 00:53:59,509
pret that's what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is meant to</font>

1309
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,010
illustrate actually is you provide

1310
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,900
preference to these other routes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1311
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,599
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a great point</font>

1312
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:07,089
to illustrate so yeah at adding<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font>

1313
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:10,299
the filtering possibly where there is a

1314
00:54:07,089 --> 00:54:12,970
filtering entry to deny more specifics

1315
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:15,339
yeah which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one place we drop in</font>

1316
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:17,200
obviously get rid of bull guns sure so

1317
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:19,839
one quick comment about the the

1318
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,129
performance impact on routers you know

1319
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,660
if you're if you're no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

1320
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,880
about generating a prefix list you're

1321
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:27,129
now talking about generating an AS path

1322
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,720
filter list you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to consider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1323
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,089
performance impact of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

1324
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:33,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're now basically doing a regex match</font>

1325
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:34,900
and yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can optimize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you</font>

1326
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:36,520
can tokenize the value out for some

1327
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,049
level of mashing for the origin a yes

1328
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:40,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">but right now that isn't done and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

1333
00:54:50,859 --> 00:54:56,348
pragmatic note how how big are the

1334
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:59,529
biggest prefix filters people have now

1335
00:54:56,349 --> 00:55:02,619
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have they encountered customers</font>

1336
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:06,640
with more prefixes than they could make

1337
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:08,109
into a prefix filter and work so they

1338
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,430
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> to question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah what's you know</font>

1339
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:10,839
what are the the largest filters

1340
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,578
anybody's deployed and have you ran in

1341
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:13,960
any deployment problems or

1342
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:16,869

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we are actually filtering all</font>

1345
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:26,319
customers and well okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for smaller</font>

peers including some some some us peers

that are even in the room we have we

1348
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:38,619
have prefix filter lists of a couple

hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> learned quickly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes there</font>

on biggest filters back when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was hope</font>

we've built filter 4701 as well as for

implications and things wrapped around

1421
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:52,129
it but it provides that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of egg and</font>

1422
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:53,450
you know the chicken and egg problem is

1423
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">like there's no source and i came in at</font>

1424
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:57,410
can't implement because of this so that

1425
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:58,759
to me is a game changer and allows

1426
00:58:57,410 --> 00:59:00,769
people to start you know looking at

1427
00:58:58,759 --> 00:59:02,059
deploying this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of policy um the</font>

1428
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:03,169
router vendors you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that you</font>

1429
00:59:02,059 --> 00:59:03,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there had to pay attention and</font>

1430
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:05,089
there's gonna be a lot of infrastructure

1431
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:06,680
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

1432
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:08,269
this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while and then you know the</font>

1433
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:10,098
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is the ISPs really have to</font>

1434
00:59:08,269 --> 00:59:11,749
step up you know the fact that some

1435
00:59:10,099 --> 00:59:13,489
don't filter customers today to me

1436
00:59:11,749 --> 00:59:14,899
doesn't seem like<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you know i</font>

1437
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:16,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think there's a Bible excuse for</font>

1438
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,049
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know mistakes happen and those</font>

1439
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:18,859
happen on the backbone side so it

1440
00:59:18,049 --> 00:59:20,839
doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're filtering</font>

1441
00:59:18,859 --> 00:59:22,640
customers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not and you know that also</font>

1442
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:24,890
has the implicit side effect that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1443
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,239
trust the rest of the internet you know

1444
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:28,009
and they're about announcements to you

1445
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:29,029
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you trust your customers so</font>

1446
00:59:28,009 --> 00:59:31,309
you're explicitly filtering<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1447
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:32,809
customer so anyway I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

1448
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:36,380
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done I personally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would love</font>

1449
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:37,849
to see a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp invest some time in</font>

1450
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,930
this you know like Deutsche Telekom and

1451
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:40,430
some of these folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you know</font>

1452
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,558
obviously very involved with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1453
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:44,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ruger and others have been and say I'm</font>

1454
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,890
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start filtering peers based on</font>

1455
00:59:44,359 --> 00:59:47,420
you know explicitly based on this data

1456
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:48,980
because this infrastructure is going to

1457
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,450
exist obviously there's a lot of

1458
00:59:48,980 --> 00:59:52,339
stepping stones to that and a secure

1459
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:54,288
routing protocol but you know given that

1460
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:55,700
the infrastructure going to be there you

1461
00:59:54,289 --> 01:00:00,970
guys should all be paying attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1462
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:03,919
um any final comments many one yes I

1463
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:06,769
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> would like you to encourage</font>

1464
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,910
talking to talking and influencing the

1465
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:13,399
policy and operation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> uri are that</font>

1466
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:16,160
when they do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki they don't wait a</font>

1467
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:19,099
long time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they create the user</font>

1468
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:22,549
interface that will actually enable you

1469
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:26,180
and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers to register your</font>

1470
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:29,630
stuff that's going to be that's going to

1471
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:33,060
be difficult but it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be about</font>

1472
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:39,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only way for getting good data and</font>

1473
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:41,490
bring us out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mess you know one</font>

1474
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:43,650
final pointer is that some of this stuff

1475
01:00:41,490 --> 01:00:46,319
is happening in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IET in the ietf</font>

1476
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:47,670
cider SI<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr working group and so if</font>

1477
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,950
you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in rpki at all either</font>

1478
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:52,080
go have a look at Jeff slides or come

1479

<font color="#E5E5E5">participate on the mailing list we would</font>
