right so my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Greg labovitz I'm</font>

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,000
with arbor networks and i'll be speaking

00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get you to lunch quickly but</font>

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,620
speaking for a few minutes about some

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,330
data collection we've been doing we call

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,369
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very creatively the internet</font>

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,199
traffic project and really it's a

8
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:21,689
collaboration amongst some researchers

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">and about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy eight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different ISPs</font>

10
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,380
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're collecting near</font>

11
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:27,599
real-time data although<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data today</font>

12
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:32,219
is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty seven of those eyes peas</font>

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,590
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period so listen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay's</font>

14

<font color="#CCCCCC">me nostalgic for what I know bills</font>

16
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,629

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,910
NSFNET<font color="#E5E5E5"> being somewhat facetious but</font>

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,070
really for a period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of about a decade we</font>

19
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,870
had really good data on what the

20
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,270
internet looked like yes net was

21
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,940
tracking data and SF net was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

25
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,370
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really knew what the</font>

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,280
internet looked like and had a really

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,220
good data set all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that changed of course</font>

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,130
with the end of the NSFNET in the rise

29
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,720
of commercial internet and today you

30
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:15,298
know there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really good data</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Google similarly have really good data</font>

35

sets but all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets generally</font>

36
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,389
are about individual ISPs or individual

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,009
sort of content<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,049
macro view of what the internet looks

39
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,759
like what you end up looking at is

40
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,070
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp data and there's been an</font>

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,049
incredible amount of bgp studies over

42
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:43,139
the last couple years or you end up

43
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:45,240
reading analyst reports and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,460
had an interesting experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> before i</font>

45
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,949
joined arbor i would offer read the

46
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,530
analyst reports even<font color="#E5E5E5"> back earlier in my</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">measurement numbers on ATM an</font>

50
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,969
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is you read Gardiner</font>

51
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,590
reports and Forrester you read<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

52
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,360
world you read all these different

53
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,610
analysts they're all different they'll

54
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,320
have different graphs how can all these

55
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,560
you know measurement based survey based

56
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,510
data sets be different and then I had

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,510
sort of an epiphany working for Arbor

58
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,310
where I add ended up

59
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:17,609
meeting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of analysts and other</font>

60
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,500
than the secret behind analyst reports

61
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,659
the secret being analysts talk to

62
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,010
vendors and that's where they get their

63
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:28,810
information not that you shouldn't trust

64
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:30,609
vendors but you know at the end of the

65
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:32,709
day turns out that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of the really</font>

66
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,440
macro level data about gross internet

67
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:37,780
trends is a little dubious and it's not

68
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the analyst I'm running well keep</font>

69
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,409
trying to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> this short but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

70
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:43,390
story DNA and I do an internet search

71
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:46,659
security survey every year folks have

72
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,399
seen it a few and Eric one of the

73
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:50,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> survey this year we</font>

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,870
asked what's the largest botnet<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs had</font>

75
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,060
ever seen and we got some really great

76
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">data we got like 70 I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Spees all</font>

77
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,500
responded with the size of botnets one

78
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,569
respond to 10,000 another respond in a

79
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,489
hundred thousand one responded five

80
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:06,069
million I mean this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

81
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,629
interesting data so as an exercise we

82
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:09,730
called up some of these eyes peas and

83
00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:11,768
said you know wow 1 million hundred

84
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,328
thousand this is great data you know

85
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:17,650
what measurement techniques did use to

86
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:21,160
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data and 201 there was always</font>

87
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:25,870
there would always be a pause and it

88
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:29,230
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a big botnet but you know</font>

89
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,940
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no dated back it up so i will</font>

90
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,948
<font color="#E5E5E5">assert at least not the researcher so</font>

91
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,930
much but certainly analyst and other

92
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:37,419
communities looking at macro trends not

93
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data actually</font>

94
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:43,120
being made up so one of the things we've

95
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:45,488
been working on in last two years is

96
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,650
really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leverage what's a</font>

97
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,870
growing internet wide data collection

98
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,959
infrastructure to date this coverage

99
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,949
covers some 2,500 now today<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe close</font>

100
00:03:52,959 --> 00:04:00,489
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3000 active probes the probes are</font>

101
00:03:56,949 --> 00:04:03,280
across some 250 ISPs with a world wide

102
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,900
geographic footprint and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only are</font>

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,209
the the probes the procedural egg

104
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,980
collecting flow or DPI but what's really

105
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:10,959
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the probes is there in</font>

106
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,179
cool bits of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

107
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,310
not off<font color="#CCCCCC"> T ones are generally not fo c 3</font>

108
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,620
s but<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally they're collecting flow</font>

109
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,690
net flow see flow j flow you know

110
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,930
whatever your variant is from all the

111
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,300
transit border routers of given ISP or

112
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,100
CDN or content provider so really

113
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting bits of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network monitor</font>

114
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,340
during routers that have the oh say e1a

116
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,989
customer networks but really core bits

117
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:40,810
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the infrastructure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> regarding a</font>

119
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:48,220
data over a very large geographically

120
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,780
topologically diverse footprints and you

121
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,950
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

122
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,900
collaboration there's been a couple

123
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:55,900
speakers had mentioned collaboration

124
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:57,429
clean last one between ISPs really this

125
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,530
is an outgrowth of an earlier effort

126
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,510
going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> about two years there was a</font>

127
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:04,059
lot of skepticism would<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP share</font>

128
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,320
security information with a publicly

129
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,780
state they were sharing security

130
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,440
information there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was nsp sec but a lot</font>

131
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,179
of skepticism about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> degree to which</font>

132
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,140
competitive ISPs would actually

133
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,750
cooperate so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arbor did a uh what we</font>

134
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,270
called the fingerprint initiative about

135
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:25,900
2005 and much extra to my amazement

136
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,020
about some 45 ISPs publicly agreed and

137
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,880
then actively began to share information

138
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,890
amongst themselves where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arbor being</font>

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,840
a third party and we've also similarly

140
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:37,659
has it that to me success with a

141
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,859
security survey so the project I'm

142
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,750
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about today really is an</font>

143
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,840
outgrowth of that we're today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

144
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,420
some 78 during the course of<font color="#CCCCCC"> study 67</font>

few<font color="#E5E5E5"> all agreeing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a share data</font>

got lots of the graphs coming from in

reporting all the traffic anomalies they

actually other insight we have with the

00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:27,109
about the attack as well as some other

255

data manipulation I won't go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> today</font>

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:31,189
as I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the data also</font>

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,980
includes some self categorization are

your tier 1 tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 tier 3 etc very</font>

259
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,550
similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the peering DB sort of data</font>

as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as your geographic area one last</font>

262
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:47,869
that much basically the ISPs all have at

263
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:50,000
least one box that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there a leader or</font>

267
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,138
out of the way I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:01,199
interesting bits which is what does<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

data show

years but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's looking at one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

great what are the significant protocols

276
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:21,480
across the 67 providers I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

277
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,160
couple of points on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this page one is</font>

278
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,020
that we're still seeing diurnal patterns

which for truly<font color="#E5E5E5"> global coverage we'd</font>

time biases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other interesting bit in</font>

283
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,560
the data is that no surprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

284
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:41,250
dominates the 67 providers followed by

sorts of business i simpiy protocols the

00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:10,710
really really really close to zero so

still waiting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the as a ipv6</font>

certainly there may be a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of native</font>

to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is I didn't realize their last two</font>

availability of content the quality of

you're seeing this slide is an outbound

the attack varies over syn flood ICMP

it's kind of cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see the attack</font>

out against single russian AV vendor who

362
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,630
seems to regularly incur the wrath of

<font color="#CCCCCC">the Internet's you know doffs attackers</font>

364
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,900

<font color="#E5E5E5">really do have again not a micro vantage</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a macro vantage point of watching</font>

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,220
and this was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly reasonable</font>

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,210

represent fingerprints of other types of

00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:02,800
attack tools lots of attackers are using

391
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,320
canned you know windows-based attack

392
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,510

these might be fingerprints of some of

00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:14,050
those individual tools as well as we're

396
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:17,530
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rise in application level</font>

line is basically excluding floods that

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,090
continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot of floods where</font>

interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in this slide and</font>

435
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,110
next slide is really the growth of the

436
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:06,820
size of attacks as cable modem speeds

437
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,299
I've been increasing across the world

438
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,918
and consumer access and you've got

439

<font color="#CCCCCC">fiber-to-the-home bandwidth to these</font>

440
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,659
botnets has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing correspondingly</font>

441
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:19,360
as well certainly going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back a couple of</font>

445
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:29,049
many attacks over 20 gig we're now reg

446
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,909
you know we're now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides a little</font>

447
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:34,299
bit old but we're now seeing you know

448
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,620
fairly common gigs over 10 gigs and this

449
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:39,340
slide is actually showing the number of

450
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,949
tax during the study period at 25 24 all

451
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,629
the way down to 1 gigabit and we really

452
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,370
are seeing an interesting growth in some

453
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:48,549
of these I still consume you know fairly

454
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:52,750
large 25 gig certainly 10 gig and above

455
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:54,639
attacks which<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to be I think you</font>

456
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:57,220
know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> for large providers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kier ones</font>

457
00:18:54,639 --> 00:19:00,189
you know 25 gig is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's getting</font>

458
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,010
it's a little bit of bandwidth it can be

459
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,600
an issue to mitigate similarly we're

460
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,299
seeing growth in the other end of the

461
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,549
spectrum in the one gig attacks and for

462
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:12,220
the 225 gig attacks actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> all was in</font>

00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">within one day in within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a 35 minute</font>

464
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,620
period so some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> sizable attacks out</font>

465
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,320
there and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next graph I think gives</font>

466
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,649
sort of an indicator both to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font>

474
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,399
audience that the bandwidth number of

attacks size of tax is growing the only

476
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:48,850
thing I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know Danny</font>

477

479
00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:55,190
makes us feel better<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

480
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,620
that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> holiday season</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ality to dos</font>

481
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,379
attacks nice to know that even hackers

482
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:04,580
and extortionists have families take

483
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:07,009
time off but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the holiday season</font>

484
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,960
things always dropped significantly in

485
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:11,600
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of tax and size of</font>

486
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,340
attacks so maybe there's hope for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

487
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,259
us on the humanity in all of us so

488
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,209
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> finish up with a just a few</font>

489
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:22,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes for questions so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my goal really</font>

490
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:23,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">was to give just a quick overview of</font>

491
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:27,019
some of the data we're trying to collect

492
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,990
certainly solicit feedback and encourage

493
00:20:27,019 --> 00:20:33,230
participation what we're really trying

494
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:35,119
to do with this data today is you know

495
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:37,190
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one this is really much more of a</font>

496
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:40,340
research effort certainly with Ann Arbor

497
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:43,369
of my participation than a commercial

498
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,830
effort so we're really trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ramp</font>

499
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:47,389
this up a bit and in doing this it's

500
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,029
kind of interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to balance some of</font>

501
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:52,248
the business privacy issues commercial

502
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:53,809
interest was in the research we think

503
00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:56,480
this is really an important way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain</font>

a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> view a macro view of internet</font>

505

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grow the participation at the</font>

507
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:06,590
same time there's some very thorny

508
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:10,220
business and legal and other<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues that</font>

509
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:13,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">were dressing with providers in sharing</font>

510
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,119
this data it's also you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

511
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:16,009
things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to do with the</font>

512
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:19,340
data set is unlike something analyst

513
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:21,110
reports actually have a reasoned you

00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,850
know methodology between<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind</font>

515
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:25,399
extrapolating the data and<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

516
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:28,070
making statements about from these 78

<font color="#E5E5E5">from these 100 providers here is an</font>

estimate of over all internet traffic

519
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:35,509
and it turns out that's actually a hard

520
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:37,460
problem you know the self categorization

521
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:40,879
of the ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> pieces show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before is a good</font>

522
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,679
example initially we had one isp based

00:21:40,879 --> 00:21:45,949
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eastern Bloc who declared themselves</font>

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,940
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tier one and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I think they</font>

525
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,519
really meant is that they were the

<font color="#E5E5E5">National PTT but the you know asking</font>

seven or eight business<font color="#E5E5E5"> units wholesale</font>

different

535
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,860
sure different<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers very difficult to</font>

536
00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:12,279
understand how to combine and

537
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,320
extrapolate that data lastly we really

538
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:16,899
are continuing pursuing this as a

539
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,389
research effort and we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a number</font>

of collaborations Princeton<font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font>

541
00:22:19,389 --> 00:22:23,019
we managed to get a weave an intern

542
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,299
funded the summer will be working with

543
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:28,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">us as well as being able to share the</font>

544
00:22:25,299 --> 00:22:34,059
data with other researchers now with

545
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:36,220
that I will open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up for questions no the</font>

546
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:40,928
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that I had when I saw your</font>

547
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:45,419
number of 357,000 attacks is it easier

548
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:49,830
difficult to identify a discrete attack

549
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:53,679
the definition of an attack is difficult

550
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,570
in that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know often these attacks</font>

551
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,980
include multiple vectors there's a

552
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:58,779
sinful I there's a pink floyd

553
00:22:56,980 --> 00:23:02,559
application attack they start at

554

556
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,870
that counts<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well the sources may</font>

557
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,759
change the destinations may change they

558
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:11,590
also they're all within the same you

559
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,899
know insider usually so they look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

560
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,639
they're the same attack but there's you

561
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:18,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">know very impress ice definitions what</font>

562
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:21,070
constitutes an attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the last</font>

563
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:22,918
question was with<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp resets with that</font>

564
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:26,620
particular account we've all heard about

565
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,710
perhaps one MSO in particular shutting

566
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">down peer-to-peer by sending TTP reset</font>

567
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,580
so I'm wondering if that attacked number

568
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:38,630
includes attacks against one's own

569
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:43,050
customers yeah the

570
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:44,520
the data does not include that but there

571
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:48,059
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> studies</font>

572
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,950

573
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:56,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">just one or two more questions job quick</font>

574
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:58,410
questions spoofing I don't quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

575
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,440
how you could detect spoofing but were

00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you able to detect spoofing and the</font>

577
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,960
second question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is regional or national</font>

578
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:11,040
differences and either the sources the

579
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,840
the targets or the types of attacks yeah

580
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,610
let me take the latter first so there

581
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,740
are actually a couple of slides we have

582
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:19,469
that didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it into this deck on</font>

583
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:21,000
regional distribution of attacks and if

584
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,780
you see me privately I can share that

585
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">data with you spoofing extra is really</font>

586
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,379
interesting you know we have do have a

587
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,939
couple of slides on spoofing where it

588
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,580
looked at the source<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses and try</font>

589
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,030
to do some determination but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

590
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,919
hard given especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow to</font>

591
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:40,290
determine spoofing one of the things

592
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,790
we're excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ability from some</font>

593
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,740
of the DPI information to at least I

594
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:47,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">ttls back to sources and if some</font>

595
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:48,600
estimate of do things<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense we do</font>

596
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,429
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what interface things come in</font>

597
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,439
and we do know you know we can compare

598
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:54,809
that against the BGP routing tables and

599
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:57,780
you know we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got some education but</font>

600
00:24:54,809 --> 00:25:00,600
you know it's a hard problem and we have

601
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,030
some numbers but there you know where

602
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,360
you've got researchers up there yeah we

603
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:09,149
and researchers yeah research problem

604
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:12,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay reuter by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jose k ripens</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

605
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:14,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you plot ipv6 data against</font>

606
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,730
ipv4 it's not interesting i wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

607
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,860
you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zoom in ipv6 to look for like</font>

608
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:23,670
certain pardon so maybe change of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pardon</font>

609
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,050
in in ipv6 traffic yeah I didn't care

610
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:27,840
the question change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Y tonight because</font>

611
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:31,710
in ipv6 patents well the traffic

612
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,730
patterns all day volume yeah again one

613
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:34,290
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems is this is kind of a</font>

614
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:35,850
side research effort that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

615
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,740
starting to internally get some funding

616
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,090
for so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't had a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time look</font>

617
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,860
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data I was actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

618
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:44,070
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could see ITF and</font>

619
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:45,899
nanog hours within the data to see

620
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:50,689
actually those patterns but we haven't

621
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,690
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of microanalysis on the ipv6</font>

622
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:58,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">david by ah Katie have you found have</font>

623
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,950
you found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the majority of the the</font>

624
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:03,639
sources and destinations of the attacks

625
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:04,990
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> singlehop connected away or are you</font>

626
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,309
finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are a bunch of a</font>

627
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:09,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">bunch of networks which are providing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Trent transit for the attacks and was it</font>

629
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,020
was there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> there any visible effect</font>

630
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:16,240
on those networks yeah we also have some

631
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,470
data we've done on that and this this a

632
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,299
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of both i don't have the slides</font>

633
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:21,280
the breakdowns but again if you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

634
00:26:19,299 --> 00:26:23,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">assume you privately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can share some</font>

635
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,539
that but there's an awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of folks</font>

636
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,250
both providing transit you know it's

637
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:29,919
basically you know whoever has the

638
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,659
eyeballs tends to be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> source and</font>

639
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,640
you know transit networks tend be good

640
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:35,830
source of transit is one way the data

641
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:39,600
breaks down and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course content</font>

642
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:39,600
providers are great make great victims

643
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:47,380
last question<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Warren kumari Google</font>

644
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:51,370
so what guarantee do I have that you're

645
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:53,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the data anonymous so that</font>

646
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,510
there is some contractual languages and

647
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,120
legal language that folks sign as they

648
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:01,539
participate regarding the data so you've

649
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,580
got that and you've got Danny<font color="#CCCCCC"> and my you</font>

650
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:07,299
know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if with my charming</font>

651
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,770
dispositions and to trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we do have</font>

652
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:10,840
some legal language and that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

653
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:14,650
gone through our legal and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs</font>

654
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:17,129
legal is the real answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

655
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">very much everyone</font>

656
