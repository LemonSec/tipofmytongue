00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,099
everybody so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> name is Ricardo Oliveira</font>

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,190
I'm from UCLA and i'm here to present

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,140
this tool to the network operators

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">collect some feedback from you and see</font>

7
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,359
if there's new features we can add to

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tool to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make it more useful to God</font>

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:34,380
Sen go so<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> joint work by all</font>

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:35,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">these people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from UCLA and so we start</font>

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,690
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this after looking some</font>

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:52,289
some routes from yahoo there's some

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,120
other messages asking if cogent really

17
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,539
deep your limelight that will be fiber

18
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:00,510
and layer and more recently this message

19
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,049
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telecon junt accident that was</font>

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:10,110
discussed in this morning by Renesys

21
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:11,850
people so basically uh there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font>

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,740
operators see there that there's a

<font color="#E5E5E5">problem they think there's a problem</font>

24
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,339
going on and they send this message to

25
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">nana of mailing list in hope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,350
someone might shed some light on the

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">incident</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is that so far</font>

28
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,619
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though this information is</font>

29
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,360
available the rotting from routing

30
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:34,009
information is available from public

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,360
sources such as route views or ripe and

32
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:39,390
so far there's no systematic way to

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,840
collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information in a systematic</font>

34
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:47,960
database and show this information so

35
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,960
that everybody can can can can use this

36
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:54,899
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other objectives</font>

37
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,750
of these two cyclops so ice please note

38
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,520
that their connectivity they know the

not expecting for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be</font>

49
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:31,500
cases where in this example you have I

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:35,830
aspx that<font color="#CCCCCC"> announce is a prefix be here</font>

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:41,280
and suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's this other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:51,430
Internet routing registry for instance

56
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,040
and it can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> check the mappings</font>

57
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:56,650
between the prefix and origin is so the

58
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,590
only way why has to trick<font color="#E5E5E5"> Z is to</font>

59
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,960
basically append the true origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> x to</font>

60
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcement so when Z receives</font>

61
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:09,820
information it has no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell if</font>

62
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:12,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really a true route or not so the</font>

63
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:16,180
Cyclops concept is is pretty simple at

64
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,829
the highest level we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this this view</font>

65
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,510
here we have the central node which is

66
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:24,040
the high of what we call the high of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

67
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,690
Cyclops therefore the name and incident

68
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,049
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the to the I we have a set of changes</font>

69
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:32,140
the green links green edges here

70
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,570
correspond to new pairings and the the

71
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:41,109
red edges correspond to the P rings at a

72
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:43,840
certain instant of time and the way we

73
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,820
show this data and we use three

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,100
different flavors if you will for

75
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:53,320
Cyclops first one is most basic one is

76
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">just show the raw data so basically we</font>

77
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,600
show for for each for each day the

78
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,670
connectivity of each asp<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,590
over more detail over over this

80
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,929
information later on just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you an</font>

81
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,640
idea of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three components second</font>

82
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:08,830
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web interface the interface</font>

83
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more elaborate way of displaying</font>

84
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:16,150
the raw data and users can use a series

85
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:19,149
of filters data filters AAS numbers and

86
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:20,709
so on relationship types to filter down

87
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:23,169
the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're very interesting</font>

88
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">and finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last one is the the</font>

89
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:29,409
visualizer which gives

90
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">a graphical perspective of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changes</font>

91
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,539
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific point in time and</font>

92
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,490
enables the correlation between

93
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:40,090
different events and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

94
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,100
over this later on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cyclops in a</font>

95
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,630
nutshell so the features<font color="#CCCCCC"> enable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by step</font>

96
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,440
clubs as i mentioned number one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault</font>

97
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:49,210
detection detecting these between

98
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,699
misconfigurations false link attacks

99
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:57,930
route leakages and so on also<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides a</font>

100
00:04:53,699 --> 00:05:00,690
quick view of the connectivity of

101
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:03,820
certain asus this might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for</font>

102
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:07,150
also for research purposes protocol

103
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:10,409
studies and so on the other one is an

104
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,669
enable detection of anomalous

105
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:15,520
anomalously pairings massive<font color="#CCCCCC"> deep</font>

106
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:19,000
earrings and so on and finally the event

107
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,030
correlation so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a diagram</font>

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,310
diagram block of the the architecture so

109
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:29,619
everything starts here in the bottom

110
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:31,449
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp data this bgp light undergoes a</font>

111
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,840
pre-processing stage where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it basically</font>

112
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:37,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we we extract all the s links from the s</font>

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,359
passes and we stamp each link with a

114
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:44,560
time stamps initial<font color="#CCCCCC"> time stamp first</font>

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:46,840
scene and last scene and this

116
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually available in the</font>

117
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,198
form of topology and weight files so the

118
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,979
weight files are basically the number of

119
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:58,990
routes carried on each link these these

120
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,210
information is also passed to another

121
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,460
block d/s relationship inference and s

122
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,799
classification block so we have ways of

123
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,609
determining the if links are provided

124
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:11,979
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're pure and so on and and</font>

125
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,990
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s classifications right now we are</font>

126
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:16,508
using a very correct classification we

127
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:20,139
have basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> four types dear ones</font>

128
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:21,430
largest be smaller ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuffs so</font>

129
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,349
all this information is entered in the

130
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,759
Cyclops database which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the central</font>

131
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:31,360
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and these information</font>

132
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,130
is input to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three components i just</font>

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,400
mentioned visualizer web interface raw

134
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,289
data so the raw data the usefulness of

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,780
the raw data is to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> post-processing</font>

136
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:41,940
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asp side</font>

137
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,369
and one feature that we are currently

138
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on is the alarm generation and</font>

139
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,470
actually I like to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> some some</font>

140
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:51,090
feedback from<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to see what alarms can</font>

141
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,950
be triggered what parameters to look at

142
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:57,359
and so on so right now about the the

143
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,440
frequency<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we update the database</font>

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,870
you're doing doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a daily basis</font>

145
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:06,510
so every day we run this script collect

146
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,990
old to clean all the s links information

147
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:12,300
and but this might not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough for</font>

148
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:14,130
some cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you need a faster</font>

149
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,530
response for case of I checks for

150
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,620
instance so we are actually planning

151
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:22,200
planning to move this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to close to real</font>

152
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:26,310
time system using this infrastructure

153
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:32,700
from CSU call bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> mon so this is also</font>

154
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:34,530
part of your future<font color="#E5E5E5"> work ok so now going</font>

155
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,430
into more detail into the raw data which

156
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,609
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first very basic information that</font>

157
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:45,300
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download from Cyclops and</font>

158
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:48,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">website so the link is up there anybody</font>

159
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:52,620
can download<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the way we organize</font>

160
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,780
data is that we have a directory<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

161
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,729
digital directory is the last digit on

162
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">ES number so for instance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this case</font>

163
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:02,640
UCLA 52 you should look for directory

164
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,190
number two and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside directory</font>

165
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:09,320
have a name with vs number so the

166
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:11,850
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the file in this files</font>

167
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,250
first you have this is number of

168
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,910
neighbor in this case the neighbor of

169
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:19,530
UCLA<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2153 s number then you have the</font>

170
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,210
name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the s number California State</font>

171
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,250
University Network then you have the

172
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,620
type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> neighbor and whisker in this</font>

173
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">case is a large SP I have the</font>

174
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,690
relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> type we have the degree the</font>

175
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,049
the time the link was first seen in BGP

176
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:37,080
the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> link was last seen and lastly</font>

177
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:40,978
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the field which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last bgp</font>

178
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,930
message seen on the s link so the goal

179
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,350
of including these this information the

180
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:47,969
last bgp message is to give some hints

181
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:51,240
for someone that is troubleshooting some

182
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,460
accident some leakage and so on you can

183
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:55,490
just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the last bgp message in</font>

184
00:08:53,460 --> 00:09:01,040
see which graphics was being innocent

185
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,040
what which were<font color="#E5E5E5"> there spaces in question</font>

186
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:07,040
so I speeds by processing this file they

187
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,150
can look for suspicious cases of

188
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,980
neighbors that were not supposed to be

189
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:18,890
there so they can use the scripting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

190
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">let their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> site to do this so the second</font>

191
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:24,300
second component going to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

192
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,530
web interface and this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> available</font>

193
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:30,660
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cyclops website so these</font>

194
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:35,699
allow users have a quick view of the

195
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:38,100
snapshot in a connectivity who connects

196
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,900
to whom so they're basically two modes

197
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,970
of connectivity you have changed only

198
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:44,220
mode and the connectivity modes change

199
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:45,720
only it only displays changes in

200
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,180
connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> noopy rings and earrings</font>

201
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:54,320
and the connectivities basically the

202
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,319
snapshot so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like</font>

203
00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:04,849
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important field is this one is</font>

204
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:07,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> s number which is the DI out Cyclops</font>

205
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,400
then you have the start date and end

206
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:14,250
date in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case I'm looking at change</font>

207
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,050
Holly mode so these will display changes

208
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,970
in connectivity between these these

209
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:23,640
dates here within this interval between

210
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:25,920
the start date and end date then you can

211
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:29,490
also do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a further filtering filter</font>

212
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,290
entries by no degree type relationship

213
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:38,640
type if you only want to see peers or

214
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:40,439
customers and this is another

215
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,540
interesting saying we can do with the

216
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,440
web<font color="#CCCCCC"> interface so which column can be</font>

217
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:48,469
searchable in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm starting the</font>

218
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,510
lifetime column so the lifetime is the

219
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:52,890
the timing days between the the first

220
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:57,750
appearance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the link and last</font>

221
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:59,610
appearance so a lifetime<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 pretty</font>

222
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,720
much is an indication of travel means

223
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,120
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> S link appear and disappear</font>

224
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,000
within the same day so it can either

225
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,810
mean there was some miss configuration

226
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,270
or most likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on someone and some</font>

227
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:16,859
malicious attack so these needs to be

228
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:20,340
look at the other information<font color="#E5E5E5"> we display</font>

229
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,020
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wait information for each link so</font>

230
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,480
the weight is basically number of routes

231
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:27,600
carried in each link and compute the way

232
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,390
to basically do an average over about a

233
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,310
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitors the full tables and we</font>

234
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:39,030
keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> track of the changes over time so</font>

235
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:41,430
we show<font color="#E5E5E5"> the average weight in this</font>

236
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:44,250
column here and then we show the

237
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:45,959
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the last value we saw</font>

238
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,450
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average so if these difference</font>

239
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,580
is is significant if it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

240
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,460
were lots of routes changing from this

241
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,130
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to another link or disappearing or</font>

242
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:58,470
appearing so these probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs we</font>

243
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:59,880
look at also and this is the kind of

244
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,060
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get your feedback</font>

245
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:07,980
about if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really a useful feature</font>

246
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:11,869
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might think might be needed and</font>

247
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:17,240
finally the visualizer so the visualizer

248
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:21,360
has a different set of notations to to

249
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,339
refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different types of nodes</font>

250
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,150
and different events bearings and

251
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:30,690
earrings in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the center we have the blue</font>

252
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:34,500
node which is the the eye of Cyclops in

253
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:38,040
this case is quest is 209 then you have

254
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,960
a set of red nodes which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

255
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,770
notes that disappear s numbers that are

256
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:49,800
no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer visible and red edges are the</font>

257
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:54,630
appearance reneges new pairings and here

258
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:57,209
below you have the time slider so you

259
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:59,880
can you can control which which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

260
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,130
the time you're interesting in observing

261
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,689
topology and so on and in right side you

262
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,130
have the set of filters which pretty

263
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:10,470
much are the same of the web interface

264
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:12,930
and you have these these new this

265
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,760
display here of the activity plot which

266
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:16,060
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about in next slide</font>

267
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">next</font>

268
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:22,530
two slides so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a summary of the</font>

269
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,570
notations we use so we identify

270
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:27,339
different nodes within different

271
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:31,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">stations you have stuff transit tier 1</font>

272
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,880
and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually might not be</font>

273
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,890
useful for like four large dimension

274
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,420
graphs because it becomes too clumsy you

275
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,970
have too many nodes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this play and you</font>

276
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,490
cannot extract anything from it but once

277
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:49,660
you have these filters and in action it

278
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:51,490
becomes more readable to graph so the

279
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:55,770
main goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> of visualizer is to event</font>

280
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:57,430
correlation so correlate on visually

281
00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,220
bearings or deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearings that</font>

282
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,380
apparently are not correlated and also

283
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:07,450
the activity plot it helps search for

284
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:09,670
anomalous event so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

285
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,520
the activity plots so the activity plot

286
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:16,689
is pretty simple basically shows on

287
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:19,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">7-day beans earrings and earrings that</font>

288
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,860
occur over time in this case is we are

289
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,500
looking at data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from two thousand four</font>

290
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:28,630
thousand eight so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

291
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:31,300
almost four years and the red edges the

292
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,700
red bars correspond to the pairings and

293
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,040
the positive green bars correspond to

294
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:43,660
new pairings and there's also this

295
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:46,209
sliding bar here the gray bar here that

296
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:49,350
should crisp that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can slide and you</font>

297
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:52,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">can zoom in on a specific time interval</font>

298
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:58,360
which will going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be reflected in the</font>

299
00:14:52,420 --> 00:15:01,420
main layout so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> again the filters</font>

300
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:04,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I already talked about so now let's</font>

301
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:07,510
start with case studies<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Stanley</font>

302
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:11,320
number one google route leakage so this

303
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:14,319
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> july nineteen thousand six</font>

304
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,930
so we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> activity plot</font>

305
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:22,600
and we noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was this specific</font>

306
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:24,219
period there with an anomalous a number

307
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,950
of hearings and appearance occurring

308
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,260
pretty much on the same

309
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:33,170
time interval so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did with resume</font>

310
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:36,520
in on this interval and we got is this

311
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:39,770
graph<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and in this graph you have in</font>

312
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:42,260
the middle which is yet so the eye out

313
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:45,410
Cyclops is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> S number of one of the s</font>

314
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:50,030
numbers of google and you see a bunch of

315
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:52,490
incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> disappearance with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lifetime</font>

316
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:56,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero so the lifetime is indicated in</font>

317
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:58,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">Indian labels on the edges so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

318
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:05,630
this means these links disappear and

319
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:08,660
appear within<font color="#E5E5E5"> same day and this was</font>

320
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:11,150
actually later confirmed by by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font>

321
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:17,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is actually correspond to a route</font>

322
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:22,720
leakage so the this was second case i

323
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:26,300
have is about yahoo outage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

324
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,370
talked about july and six<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand seven</font>

325
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:32,449
and there was a discussion on me<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanak</font>

326
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:35,320
mailing list about this so some points

327
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,790
of network stopped rich in yahoo and

328
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,270
people were wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was going on</font>

329
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:45,319
nobody had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very specific clue except</font>

330
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:50,449
maybe for google yahoo sorry or maybe

331
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:52,940
google awesome so in this case what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

332
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:57,260
did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center the main layout in in the</font>

333
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:59,240
one of Yahoo's s<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers 10 3 10 and we</font>

334
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:04,939
noticed it was these deep earring here

335
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:07,550
with lifetime of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 so we expanded the</font>

336
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:11,589
neighbor that disappear this is number

337
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:14,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">93 18 and what we notice is that the the</font>

338
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:17,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar partner of what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just shown in</font>

339
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google case this set of insolent links</font>

340
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:23,660
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifetime of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 so all these links</font>

341
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,660
were pointing to this guy 93 18 so it

342
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">turns out that apparently there was a</font>

343
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">rat leakage by this guide start announce</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nansen yahoo routes to neighbors it</font>

345
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:37,970
should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce to and traffic to</font>

346
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:40,020
yahoo was compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> from some vantage</font>

347
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:42,990
points and these these

348
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:46,080
analysis was actually confirmed in this

349
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:50,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">other website is independent analysis</font>

350
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,750
and his<font color="#CCCCCC"> website here below okay so the</font>

351
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,320
last case i have is about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cogent</font>

352
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,940
earrings so there was this question if

353
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,070
cogent really deep your limelight that

354
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:05,820
we fire<font color="#E5E5E5"> an end layer so we just look</font>

355
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:07,409
into the the graph change of cogent so

356
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:12,810
is this number here in the middle of the

357
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:15,000
blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> node 174 and we start looking we</font>

358
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:16,530
start looking if we saw this lime<font color="#CCCCCC"> lime</font>

359
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">light these numbers in questions in</font>

360
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,389
graph so we saw limelight that we fire

361
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,639
but you didn't see an layer so

362
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently cogent did not appear in</font>

363
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:31,410
layer and this was actually confirm

364
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:35,850
later on by simple soon nano<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

365
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:38,370
future work as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

366
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:42,740
working on this idea of having a

367
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:45,870
subscriber publisher system with alarms

368
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:51,990
in case that ISPs are interested in

369
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:54,540
receiving alarms whenever there's a link

370
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:56,370
with a very short lifetime or in case

371
00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:01,170
there's a significant change in link

372
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:03,000
weight and so on so these are parameters

373
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:10,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">i wanted to get some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback from you</font>

374
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:12,030
guys and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> as part of future work is</font>

375
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,580
to make this close to real time as i

376
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">mention so we I'm very interesting</font>

377
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,740
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> some feedback from ISPs you can</font>

378
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,500
check the tool at this website Cyclops

379
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">CSS isolated tu the web interface should</font>

380
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,390
be pretty easy to use for the visualizer

381
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:29,100
you need to the java application

382
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:33,060
basically so you need to download the

383
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">code and run it turn in your laptop but</font>

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,649
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do you like to be added</font>

387
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,060
Cyclops or a changin please contact me

388
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:51,270
these additional information we have

389
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:52,290
this topology database website here in

390
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,370
the bottom

391
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:58,139
aerial topology page the raw data

392
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,770
anybody can download it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can set up a</font>

about it so if you have any questions by

400
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,389
of Cyclops so I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave there</font>

for tomorrow leave that for tomorrow

402

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks Thank You Ricardo uh we</font>

403
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:39,090
could time for some questions any

404
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:41,010
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> i strung crystal from you</font>

405
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,899
start school question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I apologize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

406
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,150
coming in about half way so you made a

407
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,240
kerbal facility but the raw data really

408
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:49,800
interested me so if it's possible if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

409
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,300
can already make available those tools

410
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,620
to create that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be interested in</font>

411
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:56,310
create that raw data and the second

412
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,510
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I'm sorry mr.</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your beginning</font>

413
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,280
presentation I've seen your graduate

414
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,920
student pH too soon sometimes these

415
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,870
projects have a tendency to die after a

416
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,640
period of<font color="#E5E5E5"> six months when you graduate</font>

417
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,530
so if there's some plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep this</font>

418
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,280
going that would be great abortion<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

419
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:14,870
thanks and the plant there's a plan but

420
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,870
just starting the plan

421
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:26,279
I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and I'm not a</font>

422
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:32,309
student my project is not gonna die your

423
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:33,899
postdoc yeah if I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a faculty job and</font>

424
