1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:08,389
skip that last one so these slides were

2
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:12,540
prepared before I had a lot of my

3
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:13,829
information ready so so some of its not

4
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the slides and i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just going to</font>

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:24,150
speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here hey it worked</font>

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:26,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok just as an overview we'll talk about</font>

7
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,500
some changes since we last got together

8
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:31,320
what we're doing with the registries

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:33,930
some of the relevant IETF work that

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:39,540
we're doing and a little bit about DNS

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:41,790
SEC not not very much since the last

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,589
meeting we've launched our new iono

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,510
website if you go to it it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

14
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:50,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot more easy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> navigate and if by any</font>

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,349
chance you have you find links that

16
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,840
don't work please let us know we we

17
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,250
think we caught everything but

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,829
transitions are hard we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have missed</font>

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:06,539
a few we've enabled ipv6 transport for

20
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:09,119
web<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and mail the ipv4 registry</font>

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,159
format has been updated we've tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

22
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it more clear what things are</font>

23
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,439
unallocated boom excuse me which things

24
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,360
are unallocated which things are

25
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,389
actually reserved for specific purposes

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:26,970
and which have been allocated in to whom

27
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:28,920
the ipv4 registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML sample has been</font>

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,320

that later in the talk and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS</font>

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,449
number registry actually has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

31
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,450
updated since this slide was prepared

32
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,520
this slide is also out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of date since we</font>

33
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,340
prepared the slide a week ago we've now

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:51,479
allocated to more /<font color="#E5E5E5"> eights and so there</font>

35
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">are now only 39 free / aids the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> XML</font>

36
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,908
sample format as you can see up there

37
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:59,250
that's the URL the idea here of

38
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,649
switching all of our registries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML</font>

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,990
converting them to XML is to give us a

40
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,680
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more flexibility in how we prepare</font>

41
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data and feed it out to people so we</font>

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,239
get a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of requests for preparing</font>

43
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,549
preparing the registries in different

44
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,489
formats and this will allow us to either

45
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:20,670
say here's the raw<font color="#CCCCCC"> data yourself go do</font>

46
00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know yes we're willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

47
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:25,649
know support that kind of presentation

48
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,440
and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I'm going to talk about</font>

49
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the unallocated but used address space I</font>

don't have slides for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> Duane Wessels</font>

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">presenting it Oh arc later today and</font>

53
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:41,280
will make his results available in a

54
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:46,500
more public way pretty much as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

55
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:48,120
we get the report written basically you

56
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,410
see different results depending on what

57
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,030
it is you're measuring whether you're

58
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:53,010
measuring the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messages the</font>

59
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,290
number of clients or the number of

60
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:59,070
addresses from the unallocated blocks

61
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:02,970
and one of the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things is</font>

62
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are five net blocks that that</font>

63
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,019
occur no matter in the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten no matter</font>

64
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:15,269
how you do this measurement and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

obvious but the other ones are<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

68
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,579
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that we would not have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">predicted those particular ones so as I</font>

70
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:29,430
say we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> publishing these results</font>

71
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,650
soon and you'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find them</font>

72
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:37,680
find a report on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our website I'd say</font>

the old legacy allocations and the rirs

83
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,439
went through a process of updating all

84
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,379
that information trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more</font>

85
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:20,108
accurate and we've now reflected that in

86
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:25,810
our database as well for the IETF work

87
00:04:20,108 --> 00:04:29,169
that we're engaged<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in our c3330 bits</font>

88
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:32,680
this is to update<font color="#E5E5E5"> the assignment of net</font>

89
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:37,719
14 to the x.25 networks there's also a

90
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:40,780
few other specifics in that RFC that

91
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,949
we'd like to update at the same time so

92
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:46,419
we have a draft 01 ready and draft 02 is

93
00:04:44,949 --> 00:04:48,970
probably going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be completed by the</font>

94
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:54,039
end of this weekend and then we'll be

95
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:57,250
ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push it forward this new draft</font>

96
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,940
draft cotton v 4m cast guidelines is

97
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,580
because we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the multicast</font>

98
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:07,210
assignment guidelines are little too

99
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:10,120
vague and unclear and the experts that

100
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,370
we use to evaluate these requests have

101
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:17,740
asked for additional guidance a little

102
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:22,990
more clarity and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

103
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:28,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that through as quickly as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible this</font>

104
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:30,550
is my DNS SEC part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> update iono</font>

105
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:35,650
was asked early this year to prepare

106
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:38,310
some kind of of DST registry until such

107
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:41,229
time as the root zone is signed and

108
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,960
that's still an ongoing discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> as to</font>

109
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:46,840
whether it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be signed who will do</font>

110
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:51,159
the signing who's going to hold which

111
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">keys all of that and so we proposed to</font>

112
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:55,000
the ICANN board that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna be</font>

113
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:57,820
authorized to create what we are calling

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:02,409
an interim trust anchor repository for

115
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:04,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">tlds it's only for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tlds we will use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

116
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:07,150
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication methods that we use</font>

117
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,390
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> name server changes for instance so</font>

118
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:13,870
so a d/s record will require the same

119
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:16,030
authentication as an NS record and the

120
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:19,180
cut the the board essentially approved

121
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:22,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">this at their last time before last</font>

122
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:26,280
meeting we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to retire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

123
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:29,320
service 60 days after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root is signed</font>

124
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,030
so once we have the signing done we're

125
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to set an end-of-life date for the</font>

00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:36,940
we're simply going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take it offline at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that point we don't want it to be an</font>

alternative resource for DS records

130
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,560
initially it's going to be a distinctive

131

service and by that we mean you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

people can update through the automated

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,849
and UDP so people<font color="#CCCCCC"> might want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to read</font>

145
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:34,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's a working group item in TS VW</font>

146
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:36,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">g now even though it's still named after</font>

147
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,240
cotton yeah and we're putting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

148
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,470
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put the multicast one</font>

149
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,659
through the working group as well but

150
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,569
that when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to have originated in</font>

151
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:46,949
the working group again it has to do

152
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:51,389
with questions that have come up as

153
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:53,159
we've evaluated port requests and you

154
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,470
know distinctions between system ports

155
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,680
versus use reports and whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

156
00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,990
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> assign both the UDP port at you</font>

157
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,229
know at the same time so it's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

158
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,240
arcane problem and yet it affects pretty

159
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:08,909
directly how we allocate this finite

160
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,310
resource and that's why we're paying so

161
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:13,639
much attention to it so good question

162
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks</font>
