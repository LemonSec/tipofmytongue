1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,710
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,959
myself but defensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> confusions easy see</font>

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,490
the list so Charles<font color="#CCCCCC"> Francisco's gotta</font>

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,080
sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and jump in and out and we'll</font>

5
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,509
bounce off each other as we go through

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,400
the presentation what I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

7
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,830
about today is some practical design

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,779
implementation techniques for dynamic

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,799
packet transport and spatial reused

10
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,480
protocol so we're going to throw another

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,800
coin into they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess in terms of</font>

12
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,740
the technologies you seen today's been a

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,430
good fit for the three presentations

14
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:33,930
today in terms of the technology so what

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,850
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover today as we go through</font>

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,780
is just a designer view what are we

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:39,360
trying to achieve with this new

18
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,700
technology how will it benefit us what

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,050
are the advantages why should we be

20
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,559
looking at using rings that are

21
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,879
optimized for packet transport only some

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,289
current design techniques as people are

23
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:54,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">using for packet optimized rings how we</font>

24
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,190
can remove the transport layer from our

25
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and hopefully get done to some</font>

26
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,800
type of IP over glass technology DPT

27
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,809
basics what you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> BTW</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how does it work</font>

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,020
I think Charles<font color="#E5E5E5"> are probably committing</font>

29
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me some input robustness and</font>

30
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,289
resilience how can we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

31
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,570
technology in an environment where

32
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,710
toppers demand the Brazilians<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

33
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,869
robustness that we all see in the

34
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">networks today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then a very brief</font>

35
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,290
look at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> planned case study which will</font>

36
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,949
be carrying out in the next 60 days

37
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:27,000
versatile telecom in the Netherlands so

38
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:29,100
push on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so basically the brief is</font>

39
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,770
to affect the migration from a

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,020
traditional transmission technology to a

41
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,490
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> generation platform optimized for</font>

42
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,289
the transmission of purely packetized

43
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,579
data that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're going to try a</font>

44
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,670
name for through this tool to see how we

45
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,949
can achieve that today so why<font color="#CCCCCC"> should we</font>

46
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,149
be looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick rings basically</font>

47
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,860
what we're trying to do here is lower

48
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,500
the cost capital expenditure to build

49
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">green architecture networks so if we can</font>

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,909
remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> sth and sonic sure a dmz drop</font>

51
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,500
multiplexers from a network we can

52
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,860
significantly reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost to build</font>

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,140
this infrastructure we want to find more

54
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,210
advantageous use of bandwidth more

55
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,320
efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of bandwidth so we can</font>

56
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,929
look at things like statistical

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,429
multiplexing and sparse will reuse to

58
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,530
make sure we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use all rings as</font>

59
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,520
efficiently as possible and we want to

60
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,250
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get our management</font>

61
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,770
infrastructure

62
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,850
or as simple as possible so let's look

63
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,830
at how we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> find a single management</font>

64
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:22,329
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> something whatever you</font>

65
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,940
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the power design we're all</font>

66
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:26,890
familiar with is two rings now the

67
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,459
rotating or counterclockwise between you

68
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:34,540
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it breaking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off sdh</font>

69
00:02:30,459 --> 00:02:36,970
tributaries OC 3 or above<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to a packet</font>

70
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,170
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sauna breaking off onto our</font>

71
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,370
router so that's the design we're all

72
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,510
very used to so we're going to look at

73
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:42,550
this we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and look at this</font>

74
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,459
see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we can remove those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> edms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

75
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,170
still keep the resilience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> robustness</font>

76
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:52,510
of that design that we're all used to so

77
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:54,910
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep up SLA etc etc okay so well</font>

78
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,829
this design is robust it can be

79
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:59,020
inefficient when dealing with purely

80
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:01,930
packetized data as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

81
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">dedicated time slot for protection so</font>

82
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:07,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically we reserve one ring at all</font>

83
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:08,560
times for protection we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

84
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">commission provisions circuits</font>

85
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,209
regardless<font color="#CCCCCC"> the effort bandwidth use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

86
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,670
that circuit customer might want a PVC

87
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:18,070
that whatever whatever rate that they

88
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">may be sub that rate ninety percent of</font>

89
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:22,060
the time so we can't really specifically

90
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,380
multiplex our customers to achieve the

91
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,150
highest and<font color="#CCCCCC"> most efficient use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

92
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,950
bandwidth in a network so in look at

93
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:31,959
ways to overcome that and as we remove

94
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,359
transport layers from the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

95
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:35,880
reduce<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and complexity which is</font>

96
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well we're all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly after</font>

97
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,000
nowadays so what we're used to seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

98
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:44,860
terms of configuring a normal network

99
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,750
over sonet for example is will have a

100
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,720
route up with a permission PVC across

101
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,970
the working ring and one protection ring

102
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,470
backed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we're for backups so we</font>

103
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,450
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the reserve down</font>

104
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,950
with on the working we have the reserve

105
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,480
bandwidth number one on the working ring

106
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,730
and number<font color="#CCCCCC"> two we hope that the</font>

107
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,500
protection which is enforced on us so we

108
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:04,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a double hit there because we've</font>

109
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,100
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fixed circuit the customer may not</font>

110
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,600
be using<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the bandwidth that she's</font>

111
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,560
requested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so where I should</font>

112
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,820
think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customer's behalf so</font>

113
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,079
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and do is now remove</font>

114
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,478
that so let's have a look where we are

115
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,910
today traditionally we use we can see

116
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,909
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort laser pointer of you</font>

117
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,910
always

118
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,650
if you had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> there wasn't up yet</font>

119
00:04:24,949 --> 00:04:31,439
doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're all used to</font>

120
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:35,810
sing IP over ATM or IPO frame running on

121
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:38,669
a solid backbone with that's a pen with

122
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">an optical carriage system IP over ATM</font>

123
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,049
today we're at the packet over sonet

124
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,120
type stage where we're trying to go to

125
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:47,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">lower-cost complexity and overhead is</font>

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,849
towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP over glass solution get</font>

127
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,169
out the ATM and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pop the IP straight</font>

128
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:54,539
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the glass owners there are any</font>

129
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:59,250
issues etc etc but we'll look at those

130
00:04:54,539 --> 00:05:01,378
if we head towards tomorrow DPT what is

131
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,969
it and look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deputies also</font>

132
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,539
reading architectures that we remove

133
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:09,270
ATMs and put in routers with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DPC cards</font>

134
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:13,560
two loops architektur slightly

135
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:16,258
differently we have 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> outer ring which</font>

136
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,909
has two functions one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to contain the</font>

137
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:20,159
outer ring data and two is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contain</font>

138
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:22,438
the inner ring control and then the

139
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,060
entering does the opposite it contains

140
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:32,370
the outer in control of the entering

141
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:33,449
data so we've got the outer ring and

142
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,050
runs around here which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outer</font>

143
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:38,759
ring data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the inner in control and</font>

144
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,919
then the inside ring has the outer in

145
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,560

architecture that we all used to

189
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,120
traditionally the frame would need to

191
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,800
off here in srp it's stripped by the

192
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,240
destination which means it only needs to

193
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,770
go here so we have an immediate

194
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,930
bandwidth saving we don't need to carry

that's saving number one

so just to summarize our destination

198
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:54,610
stripping allow the destination no to

199

241

you can talk directly say for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,649
is popping a sdh tribute or in OC 3 or

291
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,179
above at either end popping it off

292
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,709
another ATM is somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit we're</font>

293
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:37,269
running it across a cloud of whatever

294
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:39,969
transmission technology you wanted to

295

296
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:45,489
whatever and then back to a separate

297
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,289
router that's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually useful for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a person it worse and then we can look</font>

299
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:55,679
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a full DPT network with rather than</font>

301
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:02,049
breaking off OC 3 running pause or even

302
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:04,419
DPT again out to the edge IP IP

303
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:07,358
end-to-end again there's no sonnet

304
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:09,039
there's no ATM there's no frame so it's

305
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:09,909
an IP only in twin solution the

306
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,579

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:20,330
okay just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick dump look at what</font>

310
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:22,880
we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we we trencher and run our</font>

312
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,540
we've currently got some fiber reigns's

317
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:40,820
here at the moment on to a DPT

318
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,990
background for some voice trials so

319
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,400
we've identified a three-phase

320
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,710
implementation we're going to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,300
these with DPT on the loop but breaking

326
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,580
off on the switch I'm a notary tributary

327
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,790
not necessarily straight off the site

328
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:08,030
and then a full DPT loop running DPT on

329
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:11,510
the entire lot breaking off DPT

330
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:15,290
everywhere so unless you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to add</font>

great<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope I can answer them</font>

338
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:38,490
a quick question name is David Cowell

339
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,389
know from our God networks a lot of your

340
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,459
test phases seem to show running<font color="#E5E5E5"> DPT on</font>

341
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:46,440
what's essentially just a point-to-point

342
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:48,719
work and I'm wondering what the

343
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,790
advantage of that is over<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know just</font>

344
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,050
standard packet over<font color="#E5E5E5"> sauna it's more of</font>

345
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:54,740
an education<font color="#CCCCCC"> process for us at this</font>

346
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,758
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I got that one slide you'll see</font>

347
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:58,649
that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move very quickly</font>

348
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:59,910
down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> full detail if that's what</font>

349
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:01,649
we're spending most of our time so it's

350
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,089
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a familiarity phase for us get</font>

351
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:04,680
used to it look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the technology see if</font>

352
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,089
we can find any scaling issues just in

353
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,250
the point-to-point with traffic issues

354
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:10,440
for example pushing large amounts of

355
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,779
traffic over I know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been some</font>

356
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,420
trials i think in germany some other

357
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,370
people here might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with the</font>

358
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,979
to answer your question directly the

359
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:21,480
point is actually the main venture

360
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:23,730
defensive used to build this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a course</font>

361
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,060
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal ring using a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> South</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font>

362
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,250
that on the pass will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one IP hop away</font>

363
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:31,018
so you're actually doing IP packet

364
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:35,519
processing in every hope your she passed

365
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:37,259
through on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> srp ring as you I see a</font>

366
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,630
not interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in receiving the packet</font>

367
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:41,130
you just bypass through the node and it

368
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,779
just gets forward on to the next node

369
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,819
and then whichever noticed in person

370
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:46,680
receiving packet that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet a blast</font>

371
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:47,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">you receive the packet and then strip it</font>

372
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,199
off in the ring if this is a unicast

373
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,180
packet and then send stuff for

374
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,529
processing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> latest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three that's a big</font>

375
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,880
difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them but</font>

376
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:56,130
but in the strict point-to-point

377
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,630
applications which were several of the

378
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:00,420
steps along there is there really any

379
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:03,860
effective difference uh for instance

380
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:07,529
when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Amsterdam in Brussels heard</font>

381
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:11,160
DPT link and the rest of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't does</font>

382
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:12,540
it matter ideally if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a you know</font>

383
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:14,370
if let the point suppose<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one</font>

384
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,329
spandex or in the ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> then what happens</font>

385
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">is they on the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because remember</font>

386
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:19,979
you're dealing with ring so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

387
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:21,719
like a east-west kind of connection so

388
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,370
if only once and it's a ring<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

389
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:26,880
other ring get a sight of the ring<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

390
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:28,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrap right you need to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to peel to</font>

391
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,329
do it like a test you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font>

392
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,189
ring to do a test and you can't you

393
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,189
break a piper to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do formal right</font>

394
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:40,880
hi my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven more I'm interested</font>

395
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:45,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">in hearing some more details on exactly</font>

396
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,899
how you work your intelligent protection

397
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:50,270
and how you manage your spatial reuse

398
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just sort of breezed over those is</font>

399
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:55,610
there here we do them how do you do them

400
00:15:52,520 --> 00:16:05,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay what on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your bike respond you want</font>

401
00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:07,250
to cover your first point on special

402
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,589
reuse is basically just a notion of

403
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,360
actually using taking advantage of

404
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:13,970
destination stripping so take for

405
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,560
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unicast packet where the</font>

406
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">only party that's actually interested in</font>

407
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,609
receiving a package actually the

408
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,290
destination node so is the source node

409
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,300
actually injects<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packet on to the</font>

410
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,449
ring the destination will strip it off

411
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:28,849
from from the ring so so now if you

412
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:30,470
think about ftdi for example with frame

413
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,870
travels the entire span of the whole

414
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,310
ring especially uses the notion where

415
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,190
you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> strip at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the destination</font>

416
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,689
point obviously for multicast type

417
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,430
traffic you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to traverse</font>

418
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,560
the entire span of the ring so that's

419
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:44,449
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only time when you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get traffic that</font>

420
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:47,000
will travel center point of up span of

421
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,529
the ring and that brings like you know

422
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic management kind of discussion as</font>

423
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:52,339
well so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

424
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,680
subscribe and I get at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

425
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:57,950
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how much was the ratio of unit</font>

426
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,459
costs versus multicast traffic and what

427
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:02,600
wasn't mentioned here is actually

428
00:17:00,459 --> 00:17:04,579
there's no token that actually

429
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,650
circulates around the ring<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you</font>

430
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:08,480
vary for different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ftdi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for example you</font>

431
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,839
notice a token that grants you access to

432
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,809
the ring almost on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ring has equal</font>

433
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,300
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ring okay until</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point</font>

434
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:20,209
when you hit congestion that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is when</font>

435
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,428
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> referred to as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SRP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fa the</font>

436
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:25,189
famous algorithm will kick in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at</font>

437
00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:27,829
that point it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will actually inform the</font>

438
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:31,130
congestion and I mean you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes</font>

439
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:33,050
upstream to basically throttle back<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

440
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:35,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this will move on until it hits all</font>

441
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,940
the notes that's causing the congestion

442
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,370
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually create what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

443
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,669
referred to as the famous domain within

444
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:46,520
the ring you know so take for example if

445
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:53,789
you go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that slide with half</font>

446
00:17:46,520 --> 00:18:00,629
create the map the map<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so yeah take</font>

447
00:17:53,789 --> 00:18:02,129
for example like you have the direction

448
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,690
of ring next is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example this way</font>

449
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,400
here and let's say yet and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have both</font>

450
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:07,140
of them then hug and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wish</font>

451
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,360
Amsterdam Amsterdam realizes there's a

452
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,429
congestion here Amsterdam will kick in

453
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FA and we'll notify then hug both of</font>

454
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:16,650
them and aunt were too slow down<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

455
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:18,299
now then over here is not affected but

456
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,880
so now you created a fairness domain

457
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:22,408
which is this section<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ring here</font>

458
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is a very useful when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

459
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:27,720
have a big ring architecture and coming

460
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,030
to your point<font color="#E5E5E5"> on intelligent pretend</font>

461
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,559
switching is basically a very

462
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,600
hierarchical so if you know for example

463
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,370
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> sonic does pertain switching is the</font>

464
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,980
same method so there's hierarchies of

465
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:40,500
protection so you spot at a very top

466
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:42,330
level where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go signal fail so if you</font>

467
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,120
don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> lighting a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five of example</font>

468
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,510
what you do so you can have like signal

469
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,000
degrade for example let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say between</font>

470
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:53,250
amsterdam and dan are you wrap around

471
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,669
this signal degrade failure and all of a

472
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden you have a type of field between</font>

473
00:18:55,669 --> 00:19:01,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">uncertain brussels and here you will</font>

474
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,970
wrap and you unwrap this section of the

475
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,919
ring here so as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible if I to</font>

476
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:08,100
preserve not one not two wrap the ring

477
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:13,740
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all all else fail then it will</font>

478
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:16,110
cause a wrap you know router software do

479
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,549
crash from occasion and we have a

480
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:22,020
special kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an optical bypassed if</font>

481
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:25,190
you will so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go power</font>

482
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,330
going to the box when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router crash</font>

483
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,669
it will go automatically go into

484
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,590
pass-through mode and it was just bypass

485
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:34,080
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets that goes through it so it</font>

486
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:36,928
doesn't actually wrap the ring

487
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,020
unnecessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope that answers the</font>

488
00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:39,020
question

489
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,060
