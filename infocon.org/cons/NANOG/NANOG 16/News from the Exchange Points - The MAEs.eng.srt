hi I'm Steve Feldman mci worldcom

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:06,089
talking about the maze pretty much the

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:13,410
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said before so if you've</font>

4
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:14,730
heard it you can go to sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> again city</font>

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">mates there's really nothing new we</font>

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,869
still have had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plain blocking so a</font>

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,580
congestion still not growing except the

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,060
necessary facility where they're still

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,939
adding new people as they have room

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:28,680
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still trying to optimize things to</font>

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,840
accommodate traffic shifts on the

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requires</font>

13
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,360
constantly moving people around of

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:39,360
different ports to try to minimize the

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:40,800
congestion stuff lots of fun most of our

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,360
engineering focus these days is really

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,370
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MA ATM so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not likely to see</font>

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,860
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more growth on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> city's history</font>

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,980
culture and of course there's the

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:56,879
obligatory y2k that's a part of what I

21
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,319
get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on right now lots of fun I</font>

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,968
had to do with charred a couple weeks

<font color="#E5E5E5">ago to give to USA today because they</font>

29
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,960
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> East is the purple line and the blue</font>

other pretty close like during that time

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,048
and you can see that for the most part

33
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">West is leveled off nicely as we stop</font>

frightening ATM maze that's what we were

37
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,579
so we're focusing on now they've

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,380
continued to grow we now have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 35 address</font>

39
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,059
allegations which means customers who

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,600
have placed orders not necessarily

41
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,740

47
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,520
turns out these days we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

enough transmission gear to bring old

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,170
I'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that and of course we have</font>

central in the next couple of weeks and

69
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,200
at this point we're open to having more

drop your salesperson a liner preferably

to add more transmission capacity at

they're putting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of new stuff</font>

including<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cola space and we expect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">have at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of our switches there</font>

90
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,379
colo at least we're actually looking at

91
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,260
replacing existing switches with

92
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,640
something that'll handle OC 48 we expect

93
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,730
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> need at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the trunking fairly</font>

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,399
quickly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer term like next year</font>

95
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">is long term we're looking at being able</font>

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,459
to offer packet over sonet based

97
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:20,310
services using mpls probably is the

98
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,389
mechanism for that so we've been looking

99
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this which isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

103
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,610
service like the other itm naps do we've

104
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">been focusing on doing fixed bandwidth</font>

105
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,650
allocation these making sure nothing is

106
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,970
oversubscribed which is what a subset of

107
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,179
the customers want but there's a whole

108
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,980
nother subset that really just wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

109
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:49,800
build things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go so we've been</font>

110
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,300
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to deal with that to do</font>

111
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,930
it correctly involves changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pierre</font>

112
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,450
maker which given the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> speed</font>

113
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:58,800
isn't going to happen real fast

114
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,690
basically idea is that when you build a

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,370
PVC you could set it up to the ubr or

116
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">ABR with whatever sets of parameters you</font>

117
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,830
like and and go from there and not have

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to worry about yuletide provisioning</font>

119
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:11,520
there's a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> short-term things that</font>

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,740
we can do one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> setting up</font>

121
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,440
a parallel full mesh of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> BR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PVCs and</font>

122
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:18,150
letting people use those if they want

123
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,219
another possibility involves raising the

124
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:22,169
minimum peak cell rate to something that

125
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful for set of small appears</font>

126
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:26,100
where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to micromanage to</font>

127
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,350
the bandwidth allocations if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody has</font>

128

opinions on that it's up to hear it this

129
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,740
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we're probably try to</font>

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement for the quick place</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

132
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,950
leaning toward the parallel full meshes

133
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,840
and simplest things to do but that's

134
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:43,560
subject to change and neither neither of

135
