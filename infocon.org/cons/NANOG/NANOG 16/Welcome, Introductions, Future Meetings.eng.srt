already<font color="#E5E5E5"> killed one laptop up here I'm</font>

190
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:05,930
hoping not to kill another one so this

commit man it worked on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm daivyn</font>

193
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,009
I'm sort of doing the Welcome tune an

194
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:18,920
odd thing although Randy Randy did a

195
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:20,269
pretty good job hiya I hadn't look I had

196
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,649
been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about what to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

197
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:23,089
about I knew Randy was going to cover

198
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,339
all these technical points plus that

199
00:11:23,089 --> 00:11:26,899
other good stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just he discovered</font>

200
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:28,509
so rather than kind of cover anything

201
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:30,680
technical I thought I might<font color="#CCCCCC"> try up</font>

202
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:32,269
telling you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top 10 things I really</font>

206
00:11:36,949 --> 00:11:39,800
