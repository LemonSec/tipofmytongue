45
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,419
last few days concerning the routing

another look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the breakdown of those</font>

announced in February we had about 8,300

00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,120
that's sort of a died off a little bit

60

75

slide so I've taken a couple of the key

76
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,950
components out of this and have have

77
