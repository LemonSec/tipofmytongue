home a few days ago but just before that

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,590
happened they granted 85 million u.s.

107

108
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,719
billed us to the project so that is

109
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:23,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">secured and a large portion of this</font>

00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:36,180
our budget for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coming years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'm</font>

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,820
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk just about the network</font>

115
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,570
component I'm lower layer type of guy so

116
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,450
i would like to stick with that the

117
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:48,389
goals we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the period until the</font>

118
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:50,880
end of 2002 is the development<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

119
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:54,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">highly advanced infrastructure and all</font>

120
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,100
our 200 customers they should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

121
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:58,919
be to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to this new</font>

122
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,590
infrastructure say end of next year

123
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:04,409
beginning of 2001 then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

124
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,780
should be really there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

125
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,419
network should be enabled for testing of

126
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,280
advanced applications by commercial

127
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,400
companies and that is the pre

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,919
competitive research that is allowed on

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,870
the network I just elaborates on the

130
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,950
fact that we serve the higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> education</font>

131
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,900
and research community

132
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:26,760
the netherlands so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an exception</font>

133
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that at the end of 2002 we expect</font>

134
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is a new network a completely</font>

135
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,080
new network service fight and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

136
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,170
time we get we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will remove the serpent</font>

137
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,599
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and how that looks I come to</font>

138
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:42,510
that later and at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> moment in time</font>

139
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">also at the end of 2002 we hope to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

140
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:48,390
the experiences with new IP features and

141
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,790
new network and access technologies and

142
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:57,060
regarding the excess I'll come to that

143
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:59,190

the numbers we hope to reach at least I

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,570
mean if we can go further we want to

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,340
extend it further and especially when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hope to expand beyond this when I</font>

196
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,870
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about background links we expect</font>

individual links at that speed and we

200
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:44,699
see the surface<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight network being</font>

201

<font color="#E5E5E5">when surf net was established in 1987 we</font>

and you see that the 20 gigs we hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

straight line coming from 1987 and this

209
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,030
is where we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I mean this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

can connect customers at OC 3 this is

214
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
is here the middle part we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

215
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,410
in the piloting face and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why i</font>

216

year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's still piloting place and</font>

219
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,459
then in the pre-production phase which

220
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,110
comes directly after that we hope to be

221
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,700
able to connect

222

223
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,860
customers will still be connected to the

225
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:55,850
then the end of the project is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

226
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,260
scaling up phase in which we convert all

227
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,480
the customers to the new infrastructure

228
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:02,810
the backbone should be a production

229
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,390
level which means certain availability

230
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:09,170
guarantees etc and then we enter the

231
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:11,420
production phase which will last for

232
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:13,579
three more years so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I look at the</font>

233
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,829
whole surface and five network we

234
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:19,310
started now for the definition phase and

235
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:22,239
the piloting face but it will be running

236
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:25,130
until the end of 2005 as we think and

237
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,079
the above part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide says next</font>

238
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:32,870
generation I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be certain</font>

239
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:35,209
it sticks or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's a</font>

of concatenation building I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> OC 3</font>

268
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,480
when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the SDH standards is</font>

269
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:05,270
STM one and the next one is STM for

270
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,510
which equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 c 12 speed but then you</font>

271
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,069
have STM for and STM for c and here is

272
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,950
the whole issue of concatenation which

273
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:15,770
is a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> in SDH and when you look at</font>

274
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:17,270
for instance cisco at the moment in time

275
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:21,890
we were building the background they

276
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:23,780
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do OST m4c but the local</font>

277
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,120
carrier was not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tm4 see</font>

278
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,829
only STM for and then with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

279
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:33,920
so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we went for the multiple</font>

280
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:35,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">OC breeze concatenated okay so where's</font>

281
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,770
on external connectivity out of the

282
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:42,470
backbone today we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have three main types</font>

00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:44,569

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,540
do or are doing right now is have the

three national channels or multicast on

366
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,570
is to have this multicast stream going

395
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:53,320
to see whether we can inside the project

elaborated on GSM and GPRS but the next

398
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:04,130
generation of mobile and then in the

402
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:15,830
whether we will be in time 2002 2003

403
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:18,770
maybe when the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> project for UMTS</font>

will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> installed in the field and that</font>

405
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:28,879
that would enable 2 megabits per second

406

through mobile telephones okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font>

407
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,280
just building the network as i said we

408
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,040
look at all these items as well like the

an authorization for access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>
