1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,350
good morning my name is John Brown and

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:09,750
in New Mexico<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have been working fairly</font>

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:12,799
diligently on deploying a spread

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,849
spectrum based wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet access</font>

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,460
mostly feel because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting fed up</font>

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,660
of dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my telephone and how</font>

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">long it takes for them to get a loop</font>

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,890
installed is pretty insane<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

9
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,630
want to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> me email as my email</font>

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,430
address if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put me on a mailing list</font>

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,500
i don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll come and hunt you down</font>

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:34,769
and shoot you remember i live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> New</font>

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mexico is legal to carry guns basically</font>

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,170
I hate overhead so i will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font>

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,480
stuff up here just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as more of a notes</font>

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,190
for me and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trapped along and</font>

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,239
then i'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn as much as I can</font>

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">with with verbiage overview why do we</font>

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,010
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do wireless types of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font>

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,539
installation equipment costs stuff like

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,510
that and the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important part the</font>

22
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:59,640
operational concerns at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

23
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,070
did that so that you would stay here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,610
not leave before you got to the real

25
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">good stuff while I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> arles we picked</font>

26
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,240
wireless infrastructure and started

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolling towards it because gives us</font>

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,619
better control of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network allows us</font>

29
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,420
to control our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to end a</font>

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,270
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better removes the tell-tale</font>

31
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,430
from the picture and allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

32
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,408
increase our revenues instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

33
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,970
a customer have to spend two or three

34
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,060
hundred dollars for a local Lube plus

35
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,280
our isp access charges the cost of a CSU

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,460
DSU<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a router and and all that we can</font>

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">get rid of a lot of that money going</font>

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,559
elsewhere and put those more those funds

39
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,670
more into our coffers and show of hands

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:43,640
how many of you are any internet

41
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:47,040
business to make money<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good ah</font>

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:48,659
install increases our revenues and one

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,310
of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> is because we can get an</font>

44
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,290
install often running typically in five

45
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:54,240
days which means i can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> building my</font>

46
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,649
customer sooner<font color="#E5E5E5"> to means i'm starting to</font>

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,740
get the revenue from that customer as

48
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:02,520
opposed to selling a circuit waiting for

49
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,130
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> west</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said the telco darn waiting</font>

50
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,289
with a carrier to install my loop 30

51
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,609
days later and then start building the

52
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,890
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can start building customer</font>

53
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,660
immediately overall I think it's cheaper

54
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,350
bandwidth because once i buy the

55
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,420
equipment

56
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:19,079
it's mine i don't have recurring

57
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:22,739
extension officers as Eric talked about

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:26,250
there is the unlicensed technology and

59
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:29,010
there's also a licensed technology we

60
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">are using unlicensed spread-spectrum</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

61
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,570
what is technically known as the is M

62
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,060
band and the instrumentation scientific

63
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,500
and medical frequency band 2.4 gigahertz

64
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,690
range the nice thing is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to</font>

65
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,630
involve the FCC in our business at that

66
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,609
level there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are other frequencies</font>

67
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,760
available you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a 900 megahertz and</font>

68
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:53,640
you have the 5.56 stuff coming spread

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,609
spectrum comes in two flavors direct

70
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,380
sequence and frequency hopping it's

71
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,750
really important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know which</font>

72
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,600
piece of type of technology you're going

73
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,460
to use in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your deployment are you going</font>

74
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use frequency hopping or are you</font>

75
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:12,270
going to use a direct sequence more

76
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:14,850
importantly are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> using one and</font>

77
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:17,070
somebody else using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and for</font>

78
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:18,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">example we have a link that's up now</font>

79
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,230
it's down right now because I'm getting

80
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,790
dumped on by frequency hopping so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

81
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,230
get a show hand see if I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend a</font>

82
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">little time on this and I think if I do</font>

83
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,859
it's worth it how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you understand</font>

84
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,119
the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between frequency hopping</font>

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:35,600
and direct speak lumps ok let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

86
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,610
spend just a couple seconds on it

87
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,579
basically frequency hopping changes

88
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:44,970
frequency about every about 50 times a

89
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,730
second and it goes over about seventy

90
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,520
nine or so channels in this 2.4

91
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,410
gigahertz range and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intention is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

92
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,330
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to land on a channel band I'm</font>

93
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,190
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a lot of high energy there</font>

94
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,380
but a narrow frequency band without a

95
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,700
megahertz then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hop off and</font>

96
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,490
come over to another one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we keep</font>

97
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,220
bouncing around and we every time we

98
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,630
bounce around to a different frequency

99
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:08,700
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we have at least</font>

100
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:10,640
I believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> six megahertz space between</font>

101
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,440
the last channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and channel i'm on now</font>

102
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:16,608
now the benefit of frequency hopping is

103
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:21,690
that you can have interference like

104
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:23,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">Stuart's microwave for example could be</font>

105
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:25,830
operating on one frequency and the

106
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,940
frequency hopping comes in sees it that

107
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:29,400
channel that

108
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's time noisy and bat hops out goes</font>

109
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,409
elsewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> frequency hopping</font>

110
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:39,930
is more robust as far as getting mail

111
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,880
frequency wiser or noise in the spectrum

112
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,200
the problem with frequency hopping is

113
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,270
that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the bandwidth so you</font>

114
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,770
don't get the bitch through there you're

115
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,960
not going to see a frequency hopping at

116
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,299
least that I've seen so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> get too much</font>

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,750
past<font color="#CCCCCC"> two or three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> megabits per second</font>

118
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,460
and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget that wall</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit that's if</font>

119
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,810
you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at your useful overhead</font>

120
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,520
you got to put the wireless packet

121
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:00,960
overhead in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the IP frame and</font>

122
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that stuff and bury that all in and</font>

123
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,930
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to see what your useful is</font>

124
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:09,600
where as direct sequence takes a channel

125
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,280
and just scans right in that Chandler

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,670
and uses that particular channel range

127
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,440
and stays there<font color="#E5E5E5"> the downside to direct</font>

128
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,360
sequence is if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's</font>

129
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">creating interference in the direct</font>

130
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,960
sequence channel area that you've

131
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,520
selected the way you solve it is you go

132
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,440
reprogram the box to go to a different

133
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel and you use that different</font>

134
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,550
channel area<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the big benefit of</font>

135
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:35,040
direct sequence is higher bandwidth and

136
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,460
in fact you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get better distance out</font>

137
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:43,020
of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using direct sequence</font>

138
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:44,849
if you're using any of the aironet 11

139
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,609
megabit cards I've loaned out to a few

140
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,590
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hauling up here now well</font>

141
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,630
if you are at<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog 11 and you use some</font>

142
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:56,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the aironet stuff that was all direct</font>

143
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:58,650
sequence I believe the 802 11 stuff

144
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,080
that's here being used is also all

145
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,940
direct sequence whereas some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old</font>

146
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,960
roam about stuff is more frequency<font color="#CCCCCC"> hot</font>

147
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,210
not going to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of time on</font>

148
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,489
license other than<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say is expensive</font>

149
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,960
requires permits two words that

150
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,740
immediately get me to move somewhere

151
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">else talk a little bit about</font>

152
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:24,180
installation obviously you have to have

153
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,180
at least two or more radios antennas and

154
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:29,040
that depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a type of installation</font>

155
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:30,600
now there are technical operational

156
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,210
concerns that come into antenna

157
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,039
selection and there is layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

158
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,979
issues that come into the antenna

159
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,810
selection people hate antennas coming up

160
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,240
on top of buildings people hate antenna

161
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:44,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">powers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

162
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,340
and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be concerned about</font>

163
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you do that install you're putting</font>

164
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,080
in a tent on top of the building they're

165
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:53,849
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to not want it to be seen some of</font>

166
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,219
them don't care if you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

167
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:59,188
one rooftop to another we've worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

168
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:00,719
some property managers where they don't

169
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:02,550
want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from one rooftop or</font>

170
00:07:00,719 --> 00:07:04,740
another and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to seen from</font>

171
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,389
the ground at all they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think</font>

172
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely hidden they want you to paint</font>

173
00:07:06,389 --> 00:07:10,979
it the same color of the building etc

174
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,609
etc etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to be careful about</font>

175
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:16,438
what kind of paint you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you go</font>

176
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,039
about doing the install while still

177
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">having an antenna that's operational now</font>

178
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:23,490
the other thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be</font>

179
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,259
concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what we found was</font>

180
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:27,000
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with property management</font>

181

00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a spread-spectrum wireless microwave</font>

183
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:32,639
is kind of a thing up on this building

184
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,020
to do internet access the first thing

185
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes in that property managers</font>

186
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,990
mind is 800 pound dish with this big

187
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:43,680
huge radome in front of it and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> triax</font>

188
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:48,270
power<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and six inch diameter guy</font>

189
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,159

192
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:56,039
lightweight aluminum it's really easy

193
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,159
just pick<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing up flims it around</font>

194
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:01,020
and away you go so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mindset</font>

195
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:03,449
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to work on getting over</font>

196
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:06,779
with the property management<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

197
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:09,389
this is not some big huge you know FAA

198
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:12,629
Navy Air Force search radar dome that's

199
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:13,770
going up on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

200
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:17,279
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how you're going to</font>

201
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,560
mount it a skid skid you can buy them or

202
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,500
you can build them I build my skids out

203
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">of unistrut it's easy it's relatively</font>

204
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,659
cheap and I can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> them any size I</font>

205
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:31,050
want by just cutting the lengths of the

206
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:34,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">other pipe and basically all skid is is</font>

207
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,930
a square box probably four to six feet

208
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,029
square or bigger depending on which

209
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,578
surface area you want and then a couple

210
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:43,529
of cross members in the center the pull

211
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:46,019
and then diagonals up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support the</font>

212
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:48,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">pull and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your pole goes up and</font>

213
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:49,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">there you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are so that's a skid the thing</font>

214
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,170
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to worry about with skids those</font>

215
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,889
that most buildings that are flat roof

216
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,959
have an equal load roof

217
00:08:53,889 --> 00:09:00,309
upon them which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> they seal the roof</font>

218
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,988
of the rubber layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> naso gravel on it</font>

219
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:03,879
well they don't want your metal skin

220
00:09:01,989 --> 00:09:05,589
rubbing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that rubber because going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

221
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">cut a hole in it then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roast going to</font>

222
00:09:05,589 --> 00:09:08,170
leak and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be upset and</font>

223
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:10,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> come and fix it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

224
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,878
whole thing snowballs so when you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

225
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:15,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">skit up make sure you get a nice thick</font>

226
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,919
rubber pad separate the rockaway put the

227
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:20,019
pad down put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the skin on top of the pad</font>

228
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,149
put the rocks back in and put it load it

229
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:24,669
up with some cinder block or sandbag to

230
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:26,529
give it a weight balance you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can build a</font>

231
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:29,470
skid a lot cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> than you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy</font>

232
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:33,249
a skid most of the wireless<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff out</font>

233
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,389
there they're charging an awful lot of

234
00:09:33,249 --> 00:09:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">money because they're really proud of</font>

235
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:38,470
their products but you can find this

236
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:39,849
stuff if you buy the raw materials you

237
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,379
can find and build it pretty cheaply

238
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,169
we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

239
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:46,809
you want to use coax cable usually 50

240
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:49,269
ohms I like using LMR 400 or LMR six

241
00:09:46,809 --> 00:09:50,829
hundred types cable Belden has a new

242
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:53,639
cable out i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the part number</font>

243
00:09:50,829 --> 00:09:57,128
yet but it's specifically designed for

244
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,839
2.4 gigahertz operations you want to

245
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:00,459
treat this cable just like you would

246
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,439
fiber so you're going to roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up in a</font>

247
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:04,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">little not make you really tight 90</font>

248
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:07,089
degree Bend and stuff like that please

249
00:10:04,809 --> 00:10:09,309
don't you want to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cable nice</font>

250
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:11,439
gentle sweeps<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to crank</font>

251
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:13,779
the foam of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> installation in dec want</font>

252
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:17,110
to keep the cable clean and you want to

253
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:20,980
tie the cable off on one of the things

254
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:23,769
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> FCC part 15 for this unlicensed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

255
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,639
they have they take the TNC type

256
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:30,279
connector and they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of break it they</font>

257
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,529
change the gender of the center and so

258
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,569
it's called a reverse polarity so if you

259
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:38,139
go to your local electronics supply shop

260
00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:39,429
and radioshack does not carry these<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

261
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,220
if you go to your local<font color="#CCCCCC"> electronics</font>

262
00:10:39,429 --> 00:10:44,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">supply shop and you want to buy the TMC</font>

263
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:48,220
connectors you want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> our PT mcs</font>

264
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,410
reverse polarity<font color="#CCCCCC"> TMC's a senal makes</font>

265
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,850
them if you need the app part number i

266
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,679
couldn't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on my laptop when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font>

267
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:55,269
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the presentation but i can get you</font>

268
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,809
the amp part number send me an email and

269
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:00,220
I'll opposed to the amp part number

270
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:03,669
typically the antennas are an end

271
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,490
connector or I think got in connector

272
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:08,470
and you can get those anywhere

273
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,660
the reason they have this reverse

274
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,730
polarity connector is so that it's not

275
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,829
real easy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe off the street to go</font>

276
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,200
and start slapping stuff together and

277
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,360
hooking it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> mismatched things</font>

278
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,360
because the SEC wants is unlicensed

279
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,760
spectrum stuff to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> certified with an</font>

antenna with a cable type and a radial

281
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,450
all done by the manufacturer they don't

282
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:30,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to they don't they're trying to</font>

third-party parts out there you also

287
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:42,550
want to do crimp and solder connectors

288
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:44,910
if you go by a cable typically<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of</font>

290
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:51,490
please take the time roll back the years

291
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,619
to good old thin net and thick that

292
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,350
ethernet instead of just doing crimp

293
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:58,300
connectors solder to stop it will make a

294
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:01,180
better connector this is an outdoor

295
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,859
installation typically you've got wind

296
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,989
loads on its you got tension on the

297
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,800

weather stuff you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want a just</font>

299
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:17,260
crimp connector so really look at

300
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:20,709
soldering it do a site survey one of the

301
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:22,839
things that that will save you lots and

302
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:25,569
lots of hours of frustration is to make

fact get a link there that the physics

428
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:41,110
works then to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out put an install</font>

and set it all up turn it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all on and</font>

00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:44,340
find out you can't get a length okay

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:45,779
easier than extending the color and a

496
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:48,690
lot cheaper we use fiber to extend the

use the fiber for two reasons one fiber

00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,559
has a great immunity to to plant noise

500
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,620
typically we're putting a radio up in

501
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:00,480
the elevator room or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HVAC room up on</font>

know your environment our biggest

get blown over a blown off and so we've

614
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">had to design some very interesting</font>

from us from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a networking perspective to</font>

617
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,570
remember that all these devices are

operating at the OSI layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are a</font>

to propagate<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the land network</font>

that you build out filtration tools are

622
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:26,460
either very limited or extremely poor I

623
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,840
really wish the wireless guys would turn

<font color="#E5E5E5">around</font>

625
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:34,699
and put stuff in other things problems

626
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,070
with interference is packet loss because

627
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,460
of poor queue depth most of these radios

628
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:42,020
do not have a deep packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> queue if they</font>

629
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,490
have to start doing lots of resend

630
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,470
you're going to blow the queue up

631
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially when you start pushing more</font>

other's name and yeah hi my name is

Raven work for infinite just a question

654
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:53,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">for Eric have you I wonder if you see</font>

655
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:55,580
this type of wireless deployment on

656
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">especially local loop side being</font>

657
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:06,770
deployed in South America countries like

658
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:11,350
Ecuador Caracas yeah what a mile on this

659
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:16,639
place I don't see any reason outside of

660
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:18,439
local frequency regulation as to why

661
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,010
this technology couldn't be deployed

662
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:26,560
down there<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I'm sure we do I can't</font>

663
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:29,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak specifically to to who is doing it</font>

664
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:31,820
again if if you'd like I'll be happy to

665
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,500
get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information for you it</font>

666
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,439
shouldn't be that difficult i mean you

667
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,170
know that you know we've gotta keep all

668
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,290
over the world

669
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:42,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">buying this stuff so so but but to get</font>

670
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,550
some specifics as to what's going on

671
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,320
outside of the US i would need to get

672
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:48,720
someone from you know some of the

673
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,330
international groups involved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

674
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,290
that information to my second question

675
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:57,149
would be is that do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would</font>

676
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">be cost effective to use this type of</font>

677
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:01,500
links as a backup to the landlines in

678
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,480
with mobile a bit more distances oh

679
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:07,020
absolutely yeah that's that's one of the

680
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,040
primary applications we've seen is is it

681
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,990
wireless is not a replacement ferb for

682
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:16,200
wire full applications or wired

683
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,940
applications it ought ments your

684
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,220
capability there it provides greater

685
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,440
flexibility it does not replace it

686
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,910
especially given<font color="#CCCCCC"> the limited limited</font>

687
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,460
Crew put that you can realize with

688
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,230
wireless it's a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> specific there are</font>

689
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,020
very specific applications that was dead

690
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,880
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> where wireless really makes sense on</font>

691
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,770
the other hand there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications</font>

692
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it just simply doesn't make sense</font>

693
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:38,190
and where it's going to be a while

694
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:40,830
before we get even anywhere near the

695
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,990
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bandwidth bet that's the</font>

696
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:45,810
specific applications that his computer

697
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:48,870
or other applications require not only

698
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:50,730
that but also of where where there may

699
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,310
be some privacy issues despite the fact

700
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:56,490
that you've got you know strong

701
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:58,350
encryption or what have you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

702
00:29:56,490 --> 00:30:01,040
you're running a critical application

703
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,179
and someone flips on their microwave and

704
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,550
you know there goes your bedside

705
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:09,570
monitoring system I mean those sorts of

706
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:12,149
things can can can detract from the use

707
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:16,490
and acceptance of wireless but you know

708
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:20,520
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those instances where there are where</font>

709
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:21,720
you can assume a reasonable amount of

710
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,360
risk and deployment of those

711
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,660
technologies it makes it makes great

712
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:31,830
sense again to speak to a case study of

wireless for checking people in and in

715
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">that way they can bypass along ski lines</font>

716
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:41,190
they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> around with a PDA with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

717
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:43,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless adapter in it and as on and you</font>

718
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,630
know a card swiper and swipe people's

719
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,779
cars as they go by check in check out of

720
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:49,700
the ski area now

721
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:52,460
takes literally just seconds at not

722
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,899
minutes instead of waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a great</font>

723
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,539
number of hours you've seen when you

724
00:30:53,899 --> 00:30:58,459
return your rental<font color="#CCCCCC"> car some of the</font>

725
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:01,129
wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications there that you can</font>

726
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">assume a particular amount of risk there</font>

727
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:05,029
when it gets the bedside monitoring when

728
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:06,889
it comes to critical process control

729
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:10,969
applications that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not make sense and</font>

730
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:12,258
therefore you need to use your judge me

731
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:16,639
to be judicious in the in deployment

732
00:31:12,259 --> 00:31:18,469
thank you real quick on I know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrow</font>

733
00:31:16,639 --> 00:31:20,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">net product</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other spread</font>

734
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:23,149
spectrum products are now also being

735
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:24,529
widely deployed in Europe so I would

736
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:26,539
imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'll start to see a lot</font>

737
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:28,339
of that hitting elsewhere Central and

738
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:32,299
South America's has been doing a lot of

739
00:31:28,339 --> 00:31:34,580
stuff wireless I blink Louis case

740
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:37,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet have either of you sing seen</font>

741
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:42,519
any deployment of other wireless

742
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,519
technologies such as LMDS or IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> / pcs</font>

743
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:53,210
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what I primarily seen has been</font>

744
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:57,830
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of CD</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PD testing but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but not much</font>

745
00:31:53,210 --> 00:32:00,499
in terms of deployment and again I think

746
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:02,599
CDP we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> dpd was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat limited in</font>

747
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:05,210
scope and bandwidth I mean it was great

748
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:07,099
five years ago but but today it just

749
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:08,839
doesn't it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hold a</font>

750
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:10,249
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of allure except for most you know</font>

751
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:12,369
some low speed low<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth</font>

752
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:12,369
applications

753
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:21,600
yeah I think we'll cut the questions

754
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:21,600
here but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least John</font>
