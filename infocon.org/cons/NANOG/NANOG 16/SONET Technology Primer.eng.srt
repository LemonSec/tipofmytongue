smoothly and people understood the need

though the best assure wasn't happening

98
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,330
it's seen you for a minute that the

into three rough categories the section

do that with other technologies as well

understanding the frame format here's

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:43,630
the beautiful drawing layout the common

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,510
some of the overhead isn't available for

00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,980
here you have a repeater you have an add

corruption II one is an order wire the

235
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:45,220
purpose of the order wire was so that a

236
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,620
technician could plug in a telephone

237
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,980
into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and talk with another</font>

238

technician the plugs a telephone

239
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:57,360
into that device so it was assumed to

240
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:59,940
each sde would build in a very simple

241

codec for a telephone for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single</font>

243
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,000
communications were down two technicians

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,969

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,720

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,910

248
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,730
implement a proprietary management

249
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:23,819
mechanism between SD if they choose but

250
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,880
the way they're intended to manage these

251
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:29,010
devices is using the three bytes d 1

252

254
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:38,880
and on top of that the device is

00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,290
supposed to run a full OSI stack and be

256

seeing it manageable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk a</font>

it's not in fact touch as it passes

through the section devices again it's

267
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:19,860
got a fairly simple 18 bytes of overhead

268
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,590
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about a lot on them</font>

a little better explanation of how the

309
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:41,969
jitter is accommodated when the payload

310
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:43,439
requires some some slip some positive

311
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,520
stuffing in other words you're late

312
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,839
delivering enough ice for the payload

313
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,089
there's a complicated sequence that

314
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,310
happens with h1 and h2<font color="#CCCCCC"> that indicate</font>

315
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,260
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a slip coming up you cannot</font>

316
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:59,430
slip every frame and you cannot adjust

317
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:01,319
the payload by more than one in fact you

318
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:03,660
have to wait for frames to adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

319
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,839

00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,939
coming h1 and h2 take on special values

321

if it's a positive slip because<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is</font>

slightly too fast free to accommodate

334
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,029
and you need a little extra spacing the

335
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:54,089
payload envelope h3 takes on the value

336

338
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,600

then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next frame begins one by</font>

00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,699
one or the other but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are some</font>

differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> in how the overhead lights</font>

592
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:34,270
are handled as well as the terms the SDH

593
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:38,290
standard starts at what we call SDS<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

594
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:40,420
and in fact they call an SDS<font color="#CCCCCC"> one for</font>

595
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:43,780
what we call an sks free so then you

596
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:48,310
start seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> SPM in the context of SDH</font>

597
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:50,649
just multiply their number by<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and</font>

598
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:52,850
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the equivalent sonnet or OC</font>

hierarchy bandwidth

600
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:59,419
there are also some simplified<font color="#CCCCCC"> data link</font>

601
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:02,900
proposals on the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix some of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">high speed links at the sonnet rate so</font>

604
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:10,460
you can reuse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same optics lasers and</font>

605
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:12,920
receivers but not incur some of the

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:18,860
sonnet overhead processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but later let</font>

607
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:22,970
routers do it at layer 3 and some of

00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:25,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">those are in theory you recover some of</font>

609
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,470
the sonnet overhead that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would under</font>

00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">eyes paid which of course still finish</font>

611
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:33,500
that is a p.m. finally and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming up in the next time the</font>

614
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,399
division multiplexer is that are on the

615
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,050
market today may or will be coming to

616
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,850
the market may in fact provides some of

617
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:47,930
the restoration capabilities this

618
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:50,929
sonnets so useful and like four so it

619
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:53,000
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting to see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Alta to find</font>

620
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:55,790
the niches in the market it seems

621
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:00,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">unlikely the sonnet will be thrown</font>

622
00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:02,120
overboard by telco anytime soon it still

623
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,100
provides access to the lower layers

624
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,840
signals it was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the motivating</font>

625
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,110
reasons for developing sonic to begin

626
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,699
with and that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have a</font>

627
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:13,639
comparable function at the wavelength

628
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,710
level where you still have to demodulate

629
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:17,750
an optical signal and then electrically

630
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,900
be multiplex it to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the little bit</font>

631
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:24,500
rate so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will be some</font>

632
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,570
peaceful coexistence when this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is posted</font>

633
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll have a brief</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> listed acronyms and</font>

634
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,300
references from which some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

635
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:36,550
information was pool and we're going to

636
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to keep you on time so</font>

637
00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:51,299
maybe a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pimp for one quick question if I</font>

see someone moving no walking away ok
