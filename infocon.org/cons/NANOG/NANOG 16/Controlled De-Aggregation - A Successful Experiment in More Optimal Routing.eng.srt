00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:09,330
I'll keep this relatively brief just

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,700
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd give an update about</font>

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,320
something but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think is interesting</font>

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,379
that we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it abovenet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might give</font>

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,850
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people things to think about and</font>

6
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:20,448
also contact us if you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing this with us</font>

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,390
so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is we're actually</font>

9
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,370
i'll talk about it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing</font>

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:40,890
taking the aggregated<font color="#CCCCCC"> ralphs from some</font>

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,169
of our peers looking to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,720
about where their customers are located

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,480
on their network more precisely<font color="#E5E5E5"> than are</font>

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,710
represented by there by the aggregate

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,569
routes that we get so routing philosophy

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,180
that underlies the network and above<font color="#E5E5E5"> MIT</font>

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,800
is to attract the traffic into our

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,440
borders by peering widely globally

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,289
unless someone once we normally set meds

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,940
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically zero at all our borders</font>

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,610
so people handed to us and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we take</font>

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,920
charge of the traffic and<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise all</font>

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,670
the routes at all points globally is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

traffic as much as possible from traffic

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,300
originating from our colocation

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,670
customers and isp customers are

28
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:27,270
collocated to retain control the data

29
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,580
and why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this well the business</font>

30
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">case is that the more that we can reduce</font>

31
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">congestion the bigger the TCP flows are</font>

32
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,100
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> means we get to build our</font>

33
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,200
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> more because all the above net</font>

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,390
customers are paying on a 95th

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,960
percentile exact sort of non tiered

36
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,790
bandwidth use so every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we make the</font>

37
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,890
network sort of better and bigger we get

38
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,540
money to put back into it so the network

39
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,070
isn't really the cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,590
isn't really expense it's what lets us

41
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,600
make the revenue and also people time is

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive the more we have control over</font>

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,479
the data closer to the end is closer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

44
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end user the easier it is the less</font>

45
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,580
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do coordination with of an ox</font>

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,410
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have said that can be</font>

47
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:13,109
time-consuming and difficult so the

48
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:15,239
underlying things we<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our meds we</font>

49
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:18,510
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too many networks honoring</font>

51
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,910
percent or in some cases much more of

52
00:02:20,989 --> 00:02:25,560
traffic increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to pick</font>

53
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:28,590
on any particular networks but some

54
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,799
people are congested and we get to build

55
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,060
customers for that but they're happy

56
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:35,760
paying more because their customers are

57
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,500
happier so step two is take the d

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,920
aggregated<font color="#CCCCCC"> route Swift meds and the</font>

59
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,500
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what does amid mean</font>

60
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,940
/ 14 I'm sure that you all get all the

61
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,489
address space that you want whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

62
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,380
get it especially you know / 16 for

63
00:02:45,489 --> 00:02:49,450
every pop so that you can you know have

64
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,670
stuff aggregated geographically you know

65
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">network topologically well but some</font>

66
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:58,260
providers have problems with that so

67
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,010
taking the aggregated routes with meds

68
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,700
yields about<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-five percent</font>

69
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,500
improvement in traffic flow sizes you

70
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,329
know the total traffic flow to the a s

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,209
is that we're honoring meds from anyway

72
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,830
if to you know turning<font color="#CCCCCC"> them up to people</font>

73
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,930
that we don't automat you know that

74
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:16,140
aren't giving us meds you know now you

75
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:19,120
know might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an even bigger improvement</font>

76
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,920
then on<font color="#CCCCCC"> top of that there's a system</font>

77
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that actually monitors congestion and</font>

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:25,149
the basic thing is that when it's ease

79
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,970
congestion to give an IPS problem spots

80
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,319
or flows in the network it tries to look

81
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,120
at the various peering pipes that we

82
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,399
have and say what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the better way to do</font>

83
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,830
it another thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

84
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,080
honoring you know taking the aggregate

85
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,940
met Ralf's both meds gives this thing

86
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,650
less work to do because<font color="#E5E5E5"> often it's</font>

87
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,079
trying to figure out that we have a path

88
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:45,430
to send up in New York you know but

89
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,840
we're sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to Chicago and there's</font>

90
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,900
some congestion on a given<font color="#CCCCCC"> network from</font>

91
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:51,910
Chicago to New York so why take the

92
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,040
aggregated rouse it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

152
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:06,300
right now but we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

153
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:09,839
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to more routes</font>

154
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,219
causing the problem it you know cause it

155
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,169
causing problems with them rebooting

156
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:17,099
after you know a few weeks instead of

157
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:19,019
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months of it was traffic</font>

as I said goes up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this approach</font>

159
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:23,399
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's good for us it's good</font>

160
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,438
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network that you know saving</font>

bandwidth across their network<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good</font>

162
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:30,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">for other networks because they can get</font>

163
00:06:27,269 --> 00:06:31,709
traffic in then on that free capacity so

164
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:33,808
and of course our customers are happy to

165
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:36,659
pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the increased traffic flows if</font>

166
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:38,249
we have any so ideally<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd like to take</font>

167
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:41,129
meaningful the aggregation from all our

168
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:42,300

171
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:47,459
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a shot and work with router</font>

172

aggregation with communities so that we

00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,419
can turn them on turn them off if we

177
00:06:55,679 --> 00:07:00,568
detect some sort of congestion problem

178
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,430
in a given<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers network and so we're</font>

179
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:03,720
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue the process heading</font>

180
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards about a goal</font>

181
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,610
of a hundred thousand routes or

182
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,780
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a total you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

183
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:11,820
know what the Internet routing table

184
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,349
growth will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know most of that</font>

185
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,420
growth would be from taking additional

186
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:17,340
routes by the end of the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

187
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,380
hopefully somewhere in the 200,000 range

188
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,760
next year so when we have switch vendors

189
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,200
come to us and say well we have these

190
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:27,570
wonderfully fast switches and they can

191
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:29,789
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> 65536 you know prefixes on an asic</font>

192
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:31,860
and we go well we already have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

193
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:33,540
80<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100,000 rels on some of the routers</font>

194
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,310
and they say well you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

195
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet say well that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not your</font>

196
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:40,230
internet but you know our internet is a

197
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:41,970
little bit you know more diverse and so

198
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:43,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't ask them a question say well I</font>

199
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,110
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> this beautiful will route are</font>

200
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,670
called the AGS and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7000 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font>

201
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:49,710
you're saying is that each of the line

202
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,030
cards in your switch can do 64,000

203
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,729
routes so what happens if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope a box</font>

204
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:56,369
is up to it and send packets to 65,000

205
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:58,050
557 destinations is it going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

206
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,490
incorrect for any decisions or is it

207
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,110
just going to thrash its brains out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

208
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,550
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had an answer on that</font>

209
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,380
from the two vendors that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

210
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,910
sell us which is but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

211
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,690

212
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:12,000
so any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions if people are</font>

213

interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> participating in this you</font>

please sorry my name is Vince polar I

some of you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I would actually</font>

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,150
appreciate some comments from some

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,609
router vendors on whether this is a

231
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,050
really valuable thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do because what</font>

00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,260
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is inherently non</font>

you're basically putting the internet

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:03,310
purpose of cider was obviously to

276
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:07,000
control routing table size I think we've

277
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:09,310
kind of jumped to the next phase as far

278
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,420
as handling routing issues like this

279
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:15,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously IP switching was pretty big a</font>

concerned that cider or that the the

problem of aggregation was going to be

283
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,390
so severe that we'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> move to</font>

284
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,050
things like I be switching etc keep our

routing table

00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:33,189
size is small and then move over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPS</font>

287
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:35,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">wishing to solve it but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think now with</font>

288
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:38,350
our gig routers terabit routers we're

289
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,990
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to address the route lookup</font>

290
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,550
issue and our current implementation

291
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:46,060
we're scaling up to about half a million

292
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:49,449
routes at full wire speed with quality

293
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:52,479
of service diffserv and also

294
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:55,120
implementing things like mpls so we're

295
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:58,630
certainly moving towards getting away

296
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,990
from some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basic issues in route</font>

297
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:04,870
look up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not saying that cider has to</font>

298
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:07,870
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything like that but the</font>

299
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,310
way the issues were the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues three</font>

300
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:13,480
years ago are different from the issues

301
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:16,959
today I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think and then of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I p6</font>

302
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,190
ipv6 comes with me into the scenario we

303
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,790
have to figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how that's going to</font>

304
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:24,370
affect things but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we can we can</font>

305
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:27,730
address some of the things that obvious

306
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,050
trying to do on a larger basis not to

307
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,990
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that cider is something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

308
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:33,130
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go away and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we might sue comments</font>

309
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,260
would be we've heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from other</font>

310
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,870
router vendors we you know believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

311
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,630
about as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we believe you know I</font>

312
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:43,660
won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there but you know we're</font>

313
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:46,209
optimistic you know that that's right

314
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:48,250
and you know this works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we like</font>

315
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:49,540
this approach and sorry if it offends

316
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,300
anyone to suggest that other people do

317
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,130
the same sure just one comment of my own

318
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,990
that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> epic properties in just the</font>

319
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,029
router memory and<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU but there's</font>

320
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,430
inherent properties of bgp little things

321
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:01,959
like convergence which are highly

322
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:04,599
dependent<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the number of paths</font>

323
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,130
available that's true so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was going</font>

324
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,899
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say actually another approach is to</font>

325
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,709
be constantly seeking to get additional

326
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:14,770
pads which actually does help with some

327
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:17,560
of the stuff as a skills but yes yeah

328
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:20,020
but we're not unaware of some of the

329
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,670
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abovenet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are very very aware</font>

330
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:24,250
of all the architectural issues some of

331
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,140
the people used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco and of</font>

332
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,329
how you build a router that does these

333
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,920
sorts of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

334
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:32,500
rally that you have an entire from a

335
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,930
whole network is going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as well</font>

336
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,459
things like convergent and there are

337
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that you can do to reduce some of</font>

338
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:39,969
that

339
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:45,000
there's you know bgp scaling methods

340
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:45,000
that you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that well thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
