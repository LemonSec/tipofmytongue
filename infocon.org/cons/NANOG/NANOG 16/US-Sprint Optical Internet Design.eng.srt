1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:13,110
alright so how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talk a little bit</font>

2
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,509
about what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing on networking</font>

3
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,980
and how we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> using optical networks</font>

4
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,779
and how we are flying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Walden effort</font>

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,789
and I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was like a good idea to</font>

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,830
start out with history so you guys could

7
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,310
understand where we are and how we how

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:31,049
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up there a couple</font>

9
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago in 1992 we build the team on</font>

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,570
that purpose plus a fully managed

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,460
network and it was like waste of

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,820
bandwidth he wants all over the place

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,360
spending the US and we needed mean to

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,530
connect that and at that point in time

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,149
one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> one other person in the</font>

17
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,430
networks and we ended up creating

18
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,538
something we need funding exposes

23
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,809
at the brick mom so we share this that

24
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:05,790
we created something called many people

25
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,600
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think everybody heard about</font>

26
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,760
right now and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how something</font>

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,750
started we also had another network on

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,430
top with we had a little member here

there are four fibers connecting

the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having for fibers instead</font>

87
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,310
of you can build wings with you can

build a client system and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,310
fiber system and somebody have talked

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,019
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's how they were going to</font>

93
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,730
put their 4p on top of its of a network

94
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,500
and they look like they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a two</font>

95
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,970
fiber protected<font color="#E5E5E5"> network but that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

96
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,298
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to reserve half the family</font>

97
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,978
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vocab depending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on other side and</font>

98
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,929
then you can have for fibers and then

99
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:25,270
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to reserve anything but</font>

100
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,250
it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost a lot of carbon mail the</font>

101
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,690
other reason for doing more fibers is

102
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,190
that you definitely have a rotting

103
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:31,990
protocol he likes on it so you're

104
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,820
leaning heavily really ugly place to

105
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:37,539
make switching happens when you have a

106
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">taker a little bit of the new players go</font>

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,360
virtually perfect circuits like whatever

109
00:04:41,289 --> 00:04:46,210
happens in the middle it always stays up

110
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,310
and if it breaks you will get a burst of

111
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,719
like 50 to 70 milliseconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of garbage</font>

112
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:51,760
before the network have switched on you

113
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,760
it's great equipment we degrade and it

114
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,950
was those to keep words which is

00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,410
see a sort of short<font color="#CCCCCC"> burst of errors okay</font>

147
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,489
now most likely they're going to take a

148
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,630
back road and take the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> driver and</font>

149
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,240
what happens if you have a for fiber

150
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:18,700
network is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it will make sure you</font>

151
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,250
lose so this guy here which is closest

152
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:23,050
to the failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> with on the circuit this</font>

153
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,340
way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will go all the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font>

154
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,200
this guy who<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows that the circuit is</font>

155
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,460
broken and going all the way out so

156
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,610
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you double the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link for the</font>

157
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:32,799
circus but we were looking at restoring

158
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,390
the circuit as fast as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font>

159
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the past this way we can restore it</font>

160
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,260
because the two network element that

161
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:44,409
understands<font color="#E5E5E5"> would happen are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

162
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:47,020
next to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> failure if you are</font>

163
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,940
connecting runners and silent equipments

164
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,979
together there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called to</font>

165
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,479
fiber handoff and for fiber handoff and

166
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:55,000
if you do for fiber handoff you have

167
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,900
working input.text there is no

168
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,759
difference between working<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protective</font>

169
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,258
they're cold working and protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

170
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,669
and if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the SONET</font>

171
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:05,000
Network they're called<font color="#E5E5E5"> east and west</font>

172
00:07:01,669 --> 00:07:07,190
working in protect the way it works is

173
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,070
like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of signaling</font>

174
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,479
between an effort and your arse<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

175
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,820
there are two ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the</font>

176
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,800
signaling the<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk of people decided</font>

177
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:17,180
that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the central universe so if</font>

178
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,370
you are doing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they call</font>

179
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:21,470
unidirectional signaling the ADM drives

180
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,729
the surprises and interesting making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

181
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:24,530
decisions because it's the central

182
00:07:22,729 --> 00:07:27,949
universe and it will only tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about</font>

183
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:30,198
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> decisions so if your are getting a</font>

184
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,330
sonic<font color="#E5E5E5"> LC for you and about circuits and</font>

185
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's unidirectional signaling there is</font>

186
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,050
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can view to tell the network</font>

187
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,760
anything the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network with some</font>

00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,590
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> on both to protect and the</font>

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,169
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the topology of the</font>

190
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,090

191
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,340
actually use one of those and<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit</font>

192
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,070
out towards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other end of the circuit</font>

193
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:52,489
and you get told by the network in k1

194
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:54,320
and k2 which one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used and there</font>

195
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:57,919
are ways of doing this one plus one and

196
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,750
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also have up to 14 circuits and</font>

197
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,340
one to text and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can tell you look</font>

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,000
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being to protect for circuit</font>

200
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,030
one the only way to change to go to this

00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:13,039
side from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right side is to send</font>

00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">singam degrade basically you use some</font>

203
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,070
bad thing of you Ikki you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get lots of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">crc or check some errors on the side of</font>

205
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:25,039
the overhead you can send some signal

206
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:27,080
path overhead papp-a is line a is loss

207
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,729
of signal have dissipated the unplug the

208
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,289
fiber and it would actually switch to

209
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:33,020
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side and if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stayed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there or</font>

210
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,419
it may try to switch back if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in</font>

211
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,039
a unidirectional environment you really

212
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,650
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have normally work if otherwise</font>

213
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would try to switch back every 15</font>

214
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:43,098
minutes without question talking to you

215
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,020
so it definitely you know if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

216
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:46,790
because if the receipt failure was going

217
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,120
towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it doesn't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

218
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:53,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">broken okay the other way of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this</font>

219
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,620
is have be directional signaling which

220
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:56,600
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are sending stuff in both</font>

221
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,450
directions but we are only something

222
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff from the only protect side towards</font>

223
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,380
the network now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a set of</font>

224
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:04,450
commands where

225
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,920
this guy can tell the network what it

226
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,350
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so they can talk to each</font>

227
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,939
other what's the teacher of doing this

228
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:13,540
well first of all I can tell the network

229
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,460
don't switch I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also if this router</font>

230
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,380
here to text that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this router here for</font>

231
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,030
some reason went out for lunch but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

232
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,410
still sending goods framing there is

233
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,670
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we forced an effort to</font>

234
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,380
switch because the necklace doesn't know

235
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:25,270
anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> IC and rotting and stuff</font>

236
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,520
and so the only way in is in a

237
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:29,380
unidirectional configuration to turn off

238
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,900
the light source end up on signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

239
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,490
in a be directional configuration well

240
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:36,550
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very can say my body over is</font>

241
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,860
dead and send a command in k1 and safety

242
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,229
switch and the network would switch and

243
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,820
use this guy so basically this

244
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,740
intersection looks like an electronic

245
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,060
monkey it doesn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything more</font>

246
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,220
intelligent you can do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> keyword back</font>

247
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:52,270
and forth there are some tricks to this

248
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,940
electronic monkey butt so a switch can

249
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,920
either be be done by command for the

250
00:09:54,940 --> 00:10:01,690
traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its detected or</font>

251
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:04,270
something broke so how does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

252
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:06,490
internal to the network well if we have

253
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,620
a circuit so the logical circuit goes

254
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,110
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> stockton in this case too</font>

255
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:12,940
pennsauken<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and its provision as one</font>

256
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,440
surrogate across the network all the

257
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,020
protections which signaling is done

258
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,310
local here and local here if you switch

259
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,050
on one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switch on the</font>

260
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:23,619
other side is no reason for causing

261
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">exchange Russians ok so assume that</font>

262
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,520
things are working the way they should

263
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:31,060
we are taking bits of this guy ok and

264
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,770
the network here looks at bits coming up

265
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,510
this router here it looks at a single

266
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,370
quality on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and it looks at a</font>

267
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:39,250
single quality on this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it may</font>

268
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,470
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok but it decides to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the working</font>

269
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,790
one so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going out towards the</font>

270
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,140
network it takes the singer<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

271
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,449
working and sent it across to the other

272
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,370
side of the network this ATM and take

273
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sang the signal and make a copy and</font>

274
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:53,830
it did send the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same bits to this guy</font>

275
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">and to this guy so the working under</font>

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,840
protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rutter receives the same bit if</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any other protocol turned</font>

278
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,650
on like keep our lives and hellos and

279
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,900
God knows what you have the world's

fastest package replicator here because

281

avoid being<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world's fastest active</font>

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:19,839
signaling coming off from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network in</font>

288
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,000
k1 k2 and decide which<font color="#CCCCCC"> r r is active</font>

289
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,529
because the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> will tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

290
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,050
it's actually running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy and</font>

291
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a dummy so this box here have a</font>

292
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:31,449
look at signaling and say I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in the</font>

293
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,508
loop I'm just sitting here sleeping ok

294
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:37,300
so if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens let's assume</font>

295
00:11:34,509 --> 00:11:40,839
that we pull the fiber here<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so light</font>

296
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:43,300
goes out on this side poof it switches

297
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,339
and the only switch that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font>

298
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,170
visible to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that instead</font>

299
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:49,480
of receiving from this guy where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font>

300
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,040
the fibroid can't receive any way it's

301
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,199
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to receive from this box in</font>

302
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,630
the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> this box</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to figure out</font>

303
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:57,490
that oops I now became active and that

304
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:59,079
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> camp comes in k2 it tells</font>

305
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,690
him Mary Thompson k1 it tells you are

306
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:05,589
now directing guys ok so this box now no

307
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in space up and this box maybe it</font>

308
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,579
may have died or it may approve the

309
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,009
fiber so it will know if it's actually

310
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:13,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">receives Betsy to know that ok I'm not</font>

311
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:16,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">no longer in the loop that can turn the</font>

312
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,290
interface down and anything bug is dead

313
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,290
gone

314
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,380
there are free ways of doing this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

315
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,850
router side if you go talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your</font>

316
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,960
friendly local people and you say that

00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the working and</font>

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,380
protect you in two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> pockets</font>

319
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,030
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring people that white</font>

320
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:37,439
suits then come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cars that they we</font>

321
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:39,839
knew we've for you because they think

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,940
that working<font color="#E5E5E5"> and protects are going to</font>

323
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,560
the same box because they are like this

324
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,910
was designed to protect the case that

325
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,089
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> booboo surrounds across the building</font>

326
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:49,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody here knows robbers</font>

327
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,360
never<font color="#CCCCCC"> crashed okay that's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

328
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,040
we want to be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cause we want to</font>

329
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">do with sailing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awful so this is no good</font>

330
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,880
because this is nice if the optics sale

331
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,510
here are the bulldozer runs across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

332
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,000
top we are fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we got detection</font>

333
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:05,580
this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of better with this life</font>

334
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,350
heartbreaks we've got some redundancy

335
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,430
but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually the best solution</font>

336
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,810
right because now because it's

337
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,339
electronic monkey that we move what my

338
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,260
important circuit from one rod is an

339
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,970
utter for me so we got the protection

340
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:16,170
stuff working in both direction both

341
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,090
were as an advantage for a network

342
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that has advantage for me but</font>

343
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:22,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make them understand</font>

344
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you run into the same box I have</font>

00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:30,320
the prices<font color="#E5E5E5"> war with our certification</font>

346
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:33,150
lab and i can tell you stories they know

347
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another toilet that was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">created called packet over sonet packet</font>

349
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a sonnet is kind of slightly hard to</font>

350
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,500
understand if you really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to read</font>

351
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,040
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard because it's scattered all</font>

over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place bottom line is are you</font>

353
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:48,660
need some kind of framing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay everybody</font>

354
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,160
has heard about htl see with<font color="#E5E5E5"> hplc you do</font>

355
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,780
bit stuff then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> insert bits and you</font>

356
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,740
delete<font color="#CCCCCC"> birthing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you say a flag is six</font>

357
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:58,020
once in a row doing that at OC 3 or OC

358
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,040
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> RO 340hp it is really hard and it</font>

359
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,329
makes you hard we're really complicated

360
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,770
another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it to reduce the</font>

361
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,300
amount of the speed you need to worry

362
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:08,040
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying is to do it on a bike level</font>

363
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,449
instead of a bit level so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

364
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,030
actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at bias and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

365
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,670
they're using 7c as an escape character

366
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,410
so if you are seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 70 it's a flag so</font>

367
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only we'd only wait for sentence M&C</font>

368
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,699
across the wire is basically take the

369
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,589
seven C and then X or the tenancy with

370
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,330
it whatever you want to send effort so

371
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:26,390
we are doing packet with its bite

372
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:28,680
synchronous instead of bit synchronous

373
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,120
everybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is old enough to be</font>

374
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,160
playing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dead gear has heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

375
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,779
something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> DD cmp and the only</font>

376
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,040
difference between this and EDC and

377
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:40,980
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at the electoral game</font>

378
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,079
last year we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> t 1</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 which is the</font>

00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:46,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">anti committee that worries about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sonic</font>

380
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,910
standard and I tu tg-7a<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain to</font>

381
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:50,850
actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> pack of ever sonnet into</font>

382
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,980
the standard and also the way of doing

383
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,019
scrambling because this almost

384
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,329
transmission systems they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed</font>

00:14:55,019 --> 00:15:00,569
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry numbers of BS rows of phone</font>

386
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:03,899
calls and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is no way cuz he idea to</font>

387
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:05,370
health and OC 3 carried like 19 1920

388
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,290
voice calls there is no way of

389
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:09,600
controlling the concept of all those

390
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">mind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over South</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two thousand phone calls</font>

391
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,180
but here all the good that comes in the

392
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">string comes from the same packet so you</font>

393
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,229
can actually cause whatever pattern to

394
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,689
go out of the rain onto the wire that

395
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,249
you would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> desire and like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sonic</font>

396
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:25,259
people didn't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's scrambler</font>

397
00:15:23,249 --> 00:15:26,790
that actually tries to make up for this

398
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:28,110
it's so stupid that you can actually

399
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,360
emulate that by putting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

400
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:33,329
pattern in you can make pause good

401
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,519
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> force a loss of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> signal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

402
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:37,920
of clock and this was fixed by putting a

403
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,480
scrambler in to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

404
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,069
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't generate the</font>

405
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,569
packet of across an effort go down and

406
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:44,009
this is when we got the standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

407
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:45,779
involved and they were actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

408
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:47,430
very helpful but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

409
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:51,120
only internet standard actually goes

into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a taco Standard anyway PEP have</font>

411
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,990
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we don't want or things</font>

412
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:56,579
we want and don't want so what we all

413
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,019
what these forget using a sprint this

414
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:01,050
variant we are having a header and the

415
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:03,360
header is a 16-bit ethernet identifiers

416
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,628
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bikers are basically we're</font>

417
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,970
done it and say it's 0 0 0 8 0 0 which

418
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:10,949
is it which is IP and if I admire

419
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,300
speaking spoken it say something else we

420
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:14,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember and then there are</font>

421
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,649
keeper lives but it is ways the one bite

422
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,240
it could be compressed into one and then

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a TRC 42</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CRF u16 if you're</font>

every what is 400 years so that's not

429
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:33,800
good enough

430
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:42,089
all right back to reality so<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the</font>

431
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:44,230

435
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,130
please what we did was those were

<font color="#E5E5E5">seventy five hundred dollars so what we</font>

did was<font color="#E5E5E5"> we took your working and we put</font>

438
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,350
the protection another box and we had it

00:16:55,029 --> 00:16:58,270
working on to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working and</font>

440
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:00,430
protects let me spread them out and then

441
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,930
you put your routers in a ring in order

442
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,139
to interconnect them sold at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font>

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">cold is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Ring of Fire you can't make</font>

445
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,280
the ring bigger than six because then

446
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot spot is going to be your</font>

447
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,730
interconnect thingy so there's an upper

448
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,040
limit to how big you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this and</font>

449
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,420
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the amount of bandwidth</font>

450
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,290
you have in the middle and the

00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,290
performance of the box

452
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:35,100
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> bill read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emails have to run a</font>

453
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:42,270

454
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this go away caring is another thing I</font>

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:46,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to go into the politics but</font>

456
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,960
do the following numbers if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

457
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,149
healthy 48 network and you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ten</font>

458
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,950
percent market share you need nine more

459
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,930
LC 48 circus that'll be every pop going

460
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:56,490
to others so peering is not something

461
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,840
you touch with a customer side yet that

462
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:01,290
such a dick or because they're actually

463
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,699
part of your court we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuse</font>

464
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,260
our investments so what happened was

465
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">then we put this new stuff you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put it on</font>

466
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,740
top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old network we kept the part</font>

467
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,879
of the old left work and we basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

468
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,410
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're due in the garden I think</font>

469
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,910
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the compost you put new</font>

470
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:17,370
stuff on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of those stuff and it takes</font>

471
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:20,490
all the stuff they rode away so this is

472
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:21,810
1996 and it actually took us into 1997

473
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:25,800
it looks like a hard limit is going to

474
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:27,540
die n97 or third quarter for 297 so we

475
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:31,470
had to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> so whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you next</font>

476
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:33,270
well we got bigger arts so we got the

477
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,830
bigger ours and remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have all</font>

478
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:37,260
those are sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here with</font>

479
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,730
point-to-point<font color="#CCCCCC"> poss interfaces going in</font>

480
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:40,800
a ring like this and then we had the

481
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:43,620
wide area interfaces so what we did was

482
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,419
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> took out two cards and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we kept one</font>

483
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,790
going this way and one going this way

484
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,410
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way we connected this long as</font>

485
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:52,409
it used to be the backbone to the new

486
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:54,330
backbone that was OC 12 and those each

487
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:59,370
world is like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know every circuit is</font>

488
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:02,850
working and protect and well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put is</font>

489
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:05,100
pretty clean and simple and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

490
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:07,159
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way if you look at the visor</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you're working your to your son at</font>

protective working now remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

498
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,110
working doesn't mean we are running and

499
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:22,889
working protects us a minute to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spare</font>

500
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:24,990
depending on what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

501
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:26,910

look at it something don't look<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

don't look into laser beam the remaining

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,200
have a be directional system go and give

the same bits to come on both circuits

and if the same bits are coming on both

530

about k1 k2 working because they came

out they are bridged out of the same

534
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:39,440
late this doesn't matter if they are

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,150
listening to working<font color="#CCCCCC"> and protects if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this problem we have to</font>

538
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,270
turn one router down so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

539
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,190
to force them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> funk or conform to</font>

they are sending cero's and those

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:58,760
singling bites and don't tell you what

544
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:59,990
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this is not a problem so we</font>

545
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,640
are really worrying from the fact that

546
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,170
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to the same blossom</font>

547
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,340
outstanding the same bit but if you're

548
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,780
following<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard the way the</font>

549
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:09,889
Senate brilliant should work and it

550
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,899
actually works I don't know at least

551
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:15,170
seven different ATM vendors with this

552
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,910
works this way of doing it we got

553
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,400
protection both for the circuits and

554
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,320
border routers and it's very it's very

555
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,360
nice to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to type reload to router</font>

556
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:31,399
and it with which and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

557
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:33,199
worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it ok so at 622 network is</font>

558
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,640
full and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something and we</font>

559
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,060
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade the circuit what do we</font>

560
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,309
do next well as points of ppl park some

561
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:43,720
people have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointing out there</font>

562
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:45,129
let's remove some stuff let's remove the

of our wishes you have to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people</font>

00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:06,340
that cleans up the signal along the path

573
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:08,129
because if he was just a long long fiber

suddenly somebody realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

different channels in peril and right

620
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:56,129
now we use to be the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consume</font>

on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now common speed for this</font>

the type of fiber the fiber is already

644
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,519
there in the ground is if the thing that

takes the most time and the most money

00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:00,059
we don't space the challenge so close

don't know on a given fiber path for

655
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,499
good about it is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try or</font>

656
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:15,029
measure it there are submarine systems

657
00:25:13,499 --> 00:25:16,619
that have been built that go like from

658
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:18,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">here to Sweden or sometime from here to</font>

659
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,820
the UK there are 4,000 miles and there's

660
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,229
not a single piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of electronics down</font>

661
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,029
there except for lasers that are doing

662
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:26,519
the same different stuff so you could

663
00:25:24,029 --> 00:25:28,649
actually be very expensive fiber put out

664
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:31,109
the correct way and what they do is they

665
00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:32,879
put fibers that are romatic dispersion

666
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:35,759
are like the first segment is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it worse</font>

667
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:37,259
with the second segment so you can't

668
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,609
really tell how fast I'm oh how long you

669
00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:42,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">can go yet to try it depends on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

different<font color="#E5E5E5"> wavelengths traveling a</font>

672
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:47,309
different speed and what is actually

673
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:48,280
happening well what's happened is when

674
00:25:47,309 --> 00:25:50,889
you send a pulse in

675
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:55,149
fiber on the receiving side it gets

676
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:56,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">widened okay and it gets moist singing</font>

677
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,030
here doesn't look at night it comes out

678
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">like this and it starts to move back and</font>

679
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:02,860
forth and becomes probably all this

680
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:04,120
analog stuff but as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you're</font>

00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the polls and you can</font>

682
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,360
actually see a pulse coming out the

683
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,610
other end of the wire you're fine if

684
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,409
your fiber is too long and you send

685
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:16,810
impulses and you see nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> your long</font>

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:18,550
pulse coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going too far so</font>

687
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:21,070
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two powers I we are losing</font>

688
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:22,930
power which we can fix with an amplifier

689
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,820
and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> accident</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they figured out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

690
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,530
same day they did this classical thing

691
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,850
they take this glass and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy acts and</font>

692
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:34,480
put this in their end and then

693
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:36,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">suddenly it became an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> empty part the bad</font>

694
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,470
news is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this amplifier only works</font>

695
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,639
in a small small window around the 15 50

696
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:41,110
nanometers and that's why there are

697
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,150
trying to space<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything on there</font>

698
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:44,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you have like the amplifiers</font>

699
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,810
work there there's fiber has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> visor</font>

700
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,310
band<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually there's more family</font>

how to amplify it anyway if you do

703
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:56,560
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this it will actually get</font>

704
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">the power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level back but whatever comes</font>

705
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:01,389
in comes out so if it's in its

706
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:03,820
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for every</font>

707
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,680
segment of fiber the signal gets noisy

708
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,750
ER and like you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like coffee</font>

709
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,530
tastes like VCRs and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> person even</font>

710
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,530
have copy protection

711
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,470
all right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use this well we</font>

712
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,450
come off the equipment in the pop which

713
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,340
is either the old ATM or it's a writer

714
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,080
or something if either speak 50 and 50

715
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,669
or it makes Peaks protein 10 and it

716
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,370
usually doesn't matter is a robe and

717
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:27,380
receiver<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay some equipment actually</font>

718
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,629
cleans up the signal here but not really

719
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,780
need it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you have other laser which</font>

720
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,670
runs in a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-defined a link those</font>

721
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,910
wavelengths are made up because they are

722
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:41,090
usually space by hundred gigahertz 49.6

723

systems or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 gigahertz 42.4 gig systems</font>

724
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:46,370
and Larry told me it was 0 point<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

725
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:48,050
nanometers 450 gigahertz so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers</font>

726
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes out here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have lots of</font>

decimals on them at these two it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

728
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:54,649
really matter but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a very good</font>

laser<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ray's very narrow band very stable</font>

730
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,010
maybe sit in a very expensive

731
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,230
environment like the temperature control

732
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,750
and stuff so you end up having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

733
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:08,300
nice signal looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one plea in a</font>

734
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:09,620
desert<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one so you take a bunch of</font>

735
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and you group them together so</font>

736
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,100
whatever goes in here is the hair is

737
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,020
that ATM<font color="#CCCCCC"> swear it shares this holds on a</font>

738
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:17,149
gear here's a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours and you</font>

739
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:18,830
put them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all together and the optical</font>

740
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,610
combines just a piece of glass<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

741
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:24,770
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a person right and you were if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

742
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,030
put the single<font color="#CCCCCC"> leg at some angle the</font>

743
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,410
different wavelengths we'd show up so

744
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:31,330
you have to put connectors berries it's

745
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:33,740
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairy pretty simple and you get a</font>

746
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:39,530
thing out that looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like multiple trees</font>

747
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:41,630
equally spaced in the desert now on the

748
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,790
receiving side there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two files like</font>

749
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,679
if there isn't the receive finding me in

750
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,720
the middle of nowhere a gene for example

751
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,900
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an example where sprint</font>

752
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:53,690
fiber that goes from California up to CL

753
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">terminate and because we can't go all</font>

754
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,530
the way without giving anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> less if</font>

755
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,940
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clean up the</font>

756
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,920
signal and then that's on by taking the

757
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:03,440
single end and we have what people call

758
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:04,880
the free r or v generator three times it

759
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,230
reshapes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've sinks too similar</font>

760
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,610
this is basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing up cleaner</font>

761
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,230
and this is the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

762
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:11,270
understand what's going on so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

763
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:12,679
doing sonnet framing it has to

764
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,500
understand sonic it is Giggy because

765
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:16,100
understand geezer and it puts it out on

766
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">another</font>

767
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,549
later if at the rehab site in the middle

768
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:21,230
of nowhere it puts us out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

769
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,879
wavelength<font color="#CCCCCC"> it came in if it's a</font>

770
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,039
terminating side it puts<font color="#CCCCCC"> its out a</font>

771
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:31,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">height of 1550</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or protein time to go</font>

772
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:32,809
into the terminating equipment ok on the

773
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,789
receive sides you take the single end

774
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:36,620
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this person thingy and you put</font>

775
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:39,980
collect your connectors on it and you

776
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:41,780
get different wavelengths come out yeah

777
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,070
those are exactly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing as on</font>

778
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,020
the transmit side so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually</font>

779
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:46,970
take one fiber and run both directions

780
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,570
I'm saying using different wavelengths

781
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:54,559
in each direction ok so you input side

782
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:58,549
you have multiple channels<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoo so we</font>

783
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:00,110
got input side that takes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok buy some</font>

784
00:29:58,549 --> 00:30:03,020
beer tonight in the bar go see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this guy</font>

785
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:06,229
with a phone and he by your ears it take

786
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,610
emphasize<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put all the villains</font>

787
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:09,440
together you may have some amplifiers

788
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,490
you take it apart you clean up the

789
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,860
singlet and send it down to the

790
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:14,960
equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> so from here to here or from</font>

791
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,520
this side to this side it looks like a

792
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,440
piece of fiber local to the building

793
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:20,600
between two routers so if you buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

794
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,159
from Sondra base WDM system you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

795
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:26,178
really need to worry on worry about

796
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:29,450
what's going on in the middle so how do

797
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:32,390
you turn it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP network oh they</font>

798
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:35,059
take two hours if some sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> WDM path</font>

799
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:37,010
or paths / / WDM that basically looks

800
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:42,080
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like a dark fiber adjustability</font>

801
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:45,320
electronics in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> total people love</font>

802
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,520
clocking they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk forever and they're</font>

803
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,470
having bits timing they have their

804
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,700
central clock in a very famous place and

805
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:53,150
it's all sorts of complicated stuff

806
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:55,309
which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need any of okay so they</font>

807
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:57,260
get really bunkers and and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

808
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:58,850
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only one requirement here</font>

809
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,260
that when they have this test sets and

810
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,399
they plug it into the middle and they

811
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,919
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch the best going both</font>

812
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,480
directions they test steps most of them

813
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,580
assume that they are parked by the same

814
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,110
clock so if you have the clock on this

815
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">side we in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the lower the crystal</font>

816
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,629
oscillator on the right card and the

817
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">router crowd on this like Rossi another</font>

818
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,190
direction the test up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> those bunkers</font>

819
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:18,500
so anything way of not having to fight

820
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,060
that war is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn one side with its</font>

821
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:23,480
point-to-point link into loop

822
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:25,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">two worst artists life and but every</font>

823
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:28,910
point-to-point link runs independent of

824
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:30,620
everything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what you really</font>

825
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:34,280
end up with having is you have a router

826
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:36,229
with a line chart here that<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs a bit</font>

827
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:38,120
coming out going over to this side

828
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,860
recovered the bits in a clock use that

829
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,270
clock to send it back because if

830
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,350
somebody plug something in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle of</font>

831
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:48,830
both directions look the same we got a

832
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:50,840
point-to-point link if you're in cocoa

833
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:54,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're different organizations and I</font>

834
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:55,580
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show in our case we have what we</font>

835
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,200
call the internet service center that

836
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,399
brought the rubber dam can have the

839
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,730
we have the writers on the other side

840
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,770
and basically we can monitor on both

841
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:09,080
sides from what's going on we can we're

842

<font color="#E5E5E5">watching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> V 1 V 1 parity errors in both</font>

843
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,159
directions and we can tell power levels

844
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:14,420
and that's about it and everything else

848
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,590
back to the story how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you build a</font>

850
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,260
in final phase of getting what i'm

851
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:33,200
showing the boat and it's based on drug

859
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,470
network well here's what we did we

860
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,910
identify the sprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop we have to stay</font>

861
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:55,360
on our fiber right to be that defy the

862
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:57,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">pops have left large traffic flows and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be built this for task for up so we have</font>

867
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:08,080
protect bottom one so we said okay let's

868
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:12,050
to use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to working on the worst pass</font>

869
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,250
okay so then we get point-to-point links

870
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:15,169
and we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in different routers to</font>

871
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,000
get redundancy and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out</font>

872
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we actually broke one of those</font>

circuits in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle on the same box</font>

874
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:22,040
we would get the possibility of

875
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,480
interconnecting all those point-to-point

876
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,610
links<font color="#E5E5E5"> in it in a way that makes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

877
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,240
and when we run<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linking</font>

878
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,979
up equipped to protect side and so if

879
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at this over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way of having</font>

880
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,830
this on an effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do protection</font>

881
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,390
switching which we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not do you doing</font>

882
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:39,439
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> deriving protocol the saving this</font>

883
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:43,520
one hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent so what we did was</font>

884
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,770
like this then this is one path<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

885
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,660
this is considered one circuit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

886
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,150
between this awesome desktop we needed a

887
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:52,400
circuit we put one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the North</font>

888
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:54,560
pass in one wire goes this way comes out

889
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,320
here it puts other one in other routers

890
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:59,000
and it goes to salt pan that way if this

891
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:01,040
breaks we're fine if the router thing

892
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,080
straight breaks we're fine and leave the

900

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to put those two ends in different</font>

902
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:26,630
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we were going to put traffic</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">good and if you run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of bandwidth you</font>

905
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:35,030
remember the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four fiber picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

907
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,800
look we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this this isn't</font>

908
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,920
very interesting this is a very

909
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting effect on ontology for</font>

910
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,790
running when something breaks if you cut

911
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,199
this path here it's a bullet it doesn't

912
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:51,679
change you just lose half of the

913
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:53,480
bandwidth so rewriting only has to be

914
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:59,569
done in the box that loose lost the

915
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:01,580
circuits so taking all those bits and

916
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:03,920
pieces and put them together this is one

917
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:05,840
certain this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one city okay that talks</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> working one working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two and then here</font>

921
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,180
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the city the talks to another city</font>

922
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we broke working one that way we</font>

923
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:24,859
formed a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network another thing that</font>

924
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:28,609
happened was that we are using this

925
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:30,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and what we're having to something</font>

926
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,280
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and they're using a variable a</font>

927
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:33,259
large amount of poor

928
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,650
so those routers in to connect two decks

929
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,910
of boxes by going to something like DPT

930
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:39,650
which talked about what's talked about

931
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:41,930
earlier we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the amount of</font>

932
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:44,150
ports used here and we get slightly more

933
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:48,080
flexibility on how to configure to

934
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:49,820
access pocket so are the entire system

935
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:51,860
looks like this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the access</font>

936
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,690
routers that talk to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backbone riders</font>

937
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,580
and if you wonder why I did it so funky

938
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:57,200
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I want to do the spatial</font>

939
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,970
reuse thing so whatever bandwidth i'm

940
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,089
using between those two<font color="#E5E5E5"> backs of boxes</font>

941
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:03,439
and the back home box<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can reuse here</font>

942
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:05,390
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just making the graphical</font>

943
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,090
nice picture because that way i would

944
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,100
have growing bandwidth everybody looks

945
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:12,260
at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was also realize that this block</font>

946
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,970
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box doing load sharing so we are</font>

normal condition we are putting traffic

949
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,779
over both and good guy here seems to

950
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:23,900
equal path going<font color="#E5E5E5"> across this box in this</font>

box to this to the customer box on this

952
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,130

<font color="#E5E5E5">exercise not by the port side because if</font>

of spaghetti but it's a great network

1016
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,680

1023
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:21,070
how it works but when if the cab driver

1024
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:24,160
takes me around the city over t1

1025

1026
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,160
think this is what we are working on for

1027
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,870
traffic restoration so when something

1028
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,790
happens in a network and looking at the

1031
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:40,630
well that doesn't matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we have</font>

effort and it turned out that this is

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,160
like tricky but we are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this</font>

1044
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,470
this year I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1046

says it doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense to make</font>

1047
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,100
it faster than 300 milliseconds because

1048
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:13,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have are used to shitty connect</font>

1049
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:17,220
connectivity nowadays because the day

1050
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduced this thing called pcs phones</font>

1051
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:22,350
so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better but</font>

1052

driving is further down<font color="#CCCCCC"> here actually</font>

1053
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:29,220
becomes theoretical exercise very hard

1054
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,630
so if you bowl enough work this way

1055
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,459
you're trying to push<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the case of</font>

specific things today and call your

00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,370
service is something we do at the edge

1058
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:36,750
because we can't keep track within the

1059
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:38,100
network at least if you want to grow

1062
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:44,670
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry about it I'm sorry this</font>

1064
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:53,070
router and this is divider so this is

00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a little support it isn't like how</font>

1066
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:57,150
we looked at it when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kid we had</font>

1067
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:59,190
ipv4 it's a packet may delivered maybe

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,170
sometimes maybe and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

1069
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,790

this one somebody from one of the

1075
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:17,100
companies said we meet they were asked

1076
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:23,190
why they were doing ATM and they said we

1077

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to feed the ducks in general for</font>

1079
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:32,370
looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> smaller CPE Bach's having LC</font>

another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we wanted to do that</font>

1087
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:55,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">we thought was the right thing to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1088
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:57,290
to deal with multicast and we started

1089
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">off with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little slightly different</font>

1090
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,960
approach than other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> said look</font>

1091
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,810
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing special unique we'd</font>

1092
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:06,380
multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> it not make it work that was</font>

1093
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:08,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple to say ok so we means that ok</font>

1094
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,680
let's memo let's make multicast part of

1095
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,750
a normal service our service is

1096
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,830
delivering ipv4 packet unicast multicast

1097
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:19,070
we don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care and you can't do</font>

1098
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:20,779
this revised by doing the way of making

1099
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,300
that progress or making it happen is to

1100
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:25,460
put it in the same network using the

1101
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,140
same tools make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like everything</font>

1102
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,940
else that the lost people and<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody</font>

1103
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,520
is dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with because he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did special</font>

1104
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">sorry we can only fix it Wednesdays when</font>

1105
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,500
a guy didn't understand so it is is

1106
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:38,390
working and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also so we wanted to make</font>

1107
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,770
multicast part of a normal things and we

1108
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,790
actually succeeded it was kind of

1109
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:46,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting why do we do make native</font>

1110
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,990
multicast well we don't need any

1111
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,119
external equipment I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy</font>

1112
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:51,919
anything we opening to make what divider

1113
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,400
rendered water rather than the promise

1114
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,600
years ago work we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for existing</font>

1115
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,460
stuff it can we connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> your duties on</font>

1116
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:04,339
any of our networks so with that pretty

1117
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:05,270
cool scalable and people debate if

1118
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:07,100
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to charge people for</font>

1119
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:08,600
multicast as a service but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean there</font>

1120
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,819
are direct savings for one too many and

1121
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,490
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most common applications</font>

1122
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:15,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok multicast that is built today the</font>

1123
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:17,118
standards-based way is not very

1124
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,800
efficient for doing a small groups many

1125
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,060
small groups too many small groups but I

1126
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,740
think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are ways that we have looked</font>

1127
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">at in the recently that we can actually</font>

1128
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn the paradigm we have into something</font>

1129
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually deal with this but</font>

1130
00:43:24,859 --> 00:43:29,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now the the majority of the</font>

1131
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:31,609
supplications people want to run is when

1132
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:34,190
to move on too many so we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1133
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,960
let's do that we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1134
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,650
standards we want to use standards that

1135
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,809
are orient<font color="#CCCCCC"> i 80 s so</font>

1136
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:41,309
we can use any vendor thingy and we can

1137
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:42,900
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and you know hit them by the</font>

1138
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:47,579
two-by-fours it doesn't work and say but

1139
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:49,589
it's a standard damn it how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1140
00:43:47,579 --> 00:43:51,930
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well inside the core they're</font>

1141
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:53,759
using maybe before with unicast and

1142
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:57,359
multicast and otherwise so it's using

1143
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-protocol PDP for and the purpose</font>

of gdp or we are what period in the

1145
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,618
youth<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scary in the multicast part</font>

1146
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:08,490
is actually unicast addresses right

1147
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:09,990
those are the multicast sources so the

1148
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,578
fact that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> unique has to fall again</font>

1149
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:14,520
the multicast appalled you may not be

1150
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:15,930
the same is reflected by using<font color="#CCCCCC"> VDP and</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information carried with</font>

00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,390
when you're doing forwarding and it's

1156
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,680

works it really ugly here is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1185
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,400
looked at multi camps the quality of the

important laws which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> print linked in</font>

00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:04,110
this is a this is a suggestion if you

00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:06,540
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is multicam using native stuff</font>

1194
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:08,010
do it the way we did and what don't

1195
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:09,000
worry about the embo and stuff even if

<font color="#E5E5E5">you have it internal to your network</font>

negative stuff it's behind this box here

1200
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:26,670
ok so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> emmy clusters we change name</font>

1201
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">and use this one loopback address to say</font>

this is the system-wide sprinting car p

1207
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,550
you have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that this becomes</font>

RP inside my network the only thing we

1238
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,849
need to do is make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a</font>

unicast addresses if those are sources

00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:01,680
get injected to my multicast we've been

multicast and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrived to rps things</font>

1242
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:10,319
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if they're only receiving and</font>

1243
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:11,399
doesn't matter this because the this is

<font color="#E5E5E5">the most simple way of doing it that</font>

00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually works and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is nothing here</font>

1246
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:16,560
they can still do multicast on<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1247
00:48:14,849 --> 00:48:19,859
ethernet even if they lose my our team

00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:21,270
okay there may be a concern and if you

1249
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:22,560
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make this work the only thing</font>

1250
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:24,630
you have to do is point out the RP

1251

configuration you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use you</font>

can still use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tim sports coat and</font>

pointed an RT inside my network but you

want you may want to be able to for
