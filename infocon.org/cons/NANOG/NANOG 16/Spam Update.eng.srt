00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,449
still the URL that you'd go to if you

10
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:39,629
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn more about it and I i</font>

executive director to give a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,329
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't have time for that</font>

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,269
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not either winning or</font>

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,789
losing the battle against spam<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,579
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of interest in it</font>

17
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are a lot of state laws their</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think differently from me who you know</font>

22
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,830
they view it as either a technology

23
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:15,149
problem or whatever so I'm still solving

24
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,310
this as a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system in</font>

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,280
educational process I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that when</font>

26
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">people get address space they ought to</font>

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,880
treat it specially and protect it and

28
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,919
not let<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people use that address</font>

29
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,920
space to to annoy me of

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,990
lord knows when we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to make</font>

31
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,500
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work this is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mail message that</font>

32
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,509
came in today to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dial-up list where</font>

33
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,819
I've highlighted the fact that somebody

34
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,630
is asking us to please add their

35
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,250
networks to the dial-up list this is not

36
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,219
uncommon it just happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have today's</font>

37
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:59,280
date on it or a close date anyway so

38
00:01:55,219 --> 00:02:00,750
dial-up list is the kind of the

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,959
industry's response to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that</font>

40
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,000
terminal servers are stupid so it would

41
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,329
be really nice if when you unit is

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,390
selling dial-up access to every spammer

43
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:14,489
in creation but that the radius servers

44
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,768
that actually authenticate those cameras

45
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:19,290
belong to other companies like Microsoft

46
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:21,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">earthlink places like that it would be</font>

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,090
great if at the time somebody did a

48
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:26,310
radius authenticate they would also have

49
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,500
port filters stuck on their terminal

50
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:33,750
server inside of a unit top somewhere

51
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:36,840
that said if if this guy wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

52
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:38,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">to an SMTP server it has to be mine in</font>

53
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,980
the guy the same guy who owned the

54
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,840
radius server because that way the

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,440
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is authenticating the user is</font>

56
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:48,239
also able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter the guys mail keep</font>

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,519
him from spamming book<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh does on his</font>

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,220
outbound now it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out Mike Odell</font>

59
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,900
does not like this idea he use the

60
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:59,069
internet as an end to end things still

61
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,630
he's one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old-timers and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

62
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:02,220
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> its controversial but it doesn't</font>

63
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,470
matter because the terminal servers are

64
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,900
too stupid to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do that and the</font>

65
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:08,700
ones that are smart enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it run</font>

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,260
at about ten percent their rated speed

67
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,319
if you actually turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn that</font>

68
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,929
feature on so what the providers are now

69
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,630
doing is saying listen for my<font color="#E5E5E5"> dial-up</font>

70
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,299
pools I really want to enforce the fact

71
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,060
that my users should only talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font>

72
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:26,310
smtp servers so if they talk to yours

73
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,500
please reject their connections and so

74
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,660
the dial-up list functions as a sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

75
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,750
a central clearinghouse for lists of

76
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,879
dial-up address ranges and it is

77
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,340
trivially possible if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go again to</font>

78
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:38,500
that web

79
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,230
page<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was telling you about m-80s mix</font>

80
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">com there are recipes to allow you to</font>

81
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:46,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">configure your send mail to say listen</font>

82
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:52,480
my users should be able to send mail to

83
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:55,000
my server but nobody else's users should

84
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,510
be able to send mail to my server unless

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,459
it's destined for one of my users and

86
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,709
it's been really cool as evidenced<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

87
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,299
the fact that people would<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather</font>

88
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,950
register with us than not nobody asked

89
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,510
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be taken out of this list and of</font>

90
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,709
course when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they do we just put them</font>

91
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">onto the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list which is which you</font>

92

can't get off of so anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's my</font>
