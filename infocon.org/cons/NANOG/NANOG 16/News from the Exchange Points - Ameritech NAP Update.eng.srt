of new customers about 20 to a month one

every two weeks it really isn't slow

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:08,700
or so as far as volume worried about to

00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:10,979
2.1 gig it was 1.8 it<font color="#E5E5E5"> last Nana actually</font>

25
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,260
a pretty big jump for just a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

26
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,390
and from what we can tell the biggest

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">driver for that has been people that are</font>

29

32
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:32,610
negative right off the bat so I think

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what we're seeing it from the big</font>

things at once because once which was in

one room and his new switches were in

44
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:03,030
another room so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had moved and some</font>

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:05,399
other transmission equipment around to

get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all done in one window so we</font>

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,568
didn't have to go back and rearrange

48
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,670
things later so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already had some</font>

customers moved over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

new customers

51
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,819
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been adding to the ascent which is</font>

since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the begin of the year so we had a</font>

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:21,140
total of<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 71 customers that we had</font>

move<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 th threes under the new OC 48</font>

58
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:34,580
system so<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything is lined up in one</font>

59
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,709
room<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we should have to do anymore</font>

60
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,090
rearrangements for that I think it's

61
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,750
worth<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioning at the glow view that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we use was in service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for free for a</font>

little bit over<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years actually uh</font>

64
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,349
we had some early stuff on it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually called a nap switch in October</font>

66
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:53,540
94 and overall it was pretty reliable we

67
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:55,099
only had one major outage across the

68
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,828
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period they had a few</font>

69
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,510
minor ones but generally it was really

70
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:01,370
really stable and we're pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy</font>

71
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,980
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way it performed at the wrong</font>

72
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:06,170
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were using it we probably used a</font>

73
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,179
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit longer but it didn't support</font>

74
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,750
OC 12 and it was would have been a

75
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,480
pretty painful upgrade so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

76
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:18,170
ascent platform what this finest right

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:22,399
away is is a COC 12 demand that we've

78
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:23,720
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing signaling support svcs which</font>

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,540
we might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some of our any</font>

80
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:29,000
customers mpls which we're going to be

81
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,310
ready for in probably next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year like</font>

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,790
like Steven mentioned it he'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

83
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,349
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> two and improve SNMP support</font>

84
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,510
better stats and then we've been able to

85
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,358
<font color="#E5E5E5">do so far on the talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in a</font>

86
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:43,790
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes this is kind of a list of</font>

87
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:46,730
the new customers or customers that are

88
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,078
just about to connect one of the reasons

89
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:49,970
that we've still had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the steady growth</font>

90
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:52,730
is that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to save ISPs we've</font>

91
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:54,290
got start at it which is an NSF program

92
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,750
for international connections for

93
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,870
research education we've got internet to

94
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Abilene EBS and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other government related</font>

95
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,819
stuff too so all they stuff combined

96
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:09,440
together is contributed to the growth

97
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:10,940
we've had what's next enhanced which

98
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,590
based reporting now we've got a new

99
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,560
platform we've got to availability of a

100
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:16,700
lot better SMP statistics the DSP

101
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">proxies and we were using on the</font>

102
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,000
looseness which had been broken for

103
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:21,978
quite a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't even</font>

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,599
responding to all the polls and it

105
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:23,950
wasn't necessarily all that accurate and

106
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:26,590
they

107
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,630
we really can do much with it so we're

108
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">planning on being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to offer / PVC</font>

stats via secure web connection to

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,910
customers i'm hoping that i'll turn out

111
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,400
to be a good engineering tool at least

112
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,140
in additional you might already have and

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,239
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregate</font>

doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably with some type of mr TG</font>

there and the discussion was the

119
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,060
adversary's numbering and we have took

120
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,799
the comments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got back from</font>

121
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,550
everybody and tried to address all the

122
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,840
concerns and after a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion</font>

123
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:04,510
we decided to go ahead with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

124
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,130
remembering with new space that we got a
