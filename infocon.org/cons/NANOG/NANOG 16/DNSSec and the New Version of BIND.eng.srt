1
00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:14,870
okay before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get started are there any</font>

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:20,220
questions oh sure oh ok ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh I wasn't</font>

3
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:21,990
so about DNS security there are there is

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,599
a lot to say there has not been a lot

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,538
has really been done in a useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> fashion</font>

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,910
but sort of like ipv6 it's believed that

7
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:41,190
it's better to know what's coming if it

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:43,140
comes see here is my windows laptop so

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,530
the protocol itself was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to</font>

10
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,700
be secure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure as hell it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

11
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:52,890
a trivial matter to either make a result

12
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:57,149
or believe that your<font color="#CCCCCC"> response is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

13
00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,030
it was waiting for or to insert your

14
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:02,129
data into<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone else's cash as a side</font>

15
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,280
effect of them asking you some question

16
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,189
and there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no validation model</font>

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,670
in the underlying protocol and that

18
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:17,699
makes it kind of dangerous to believe

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything you hear from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns and like to</font>

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:26,220
think that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are no more location</font>

21
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:29,820
buzz but you know now that I'm first

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">find has always been perfect but however</font>

23
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,809
there are other implementations as well

24
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,570
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a good time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

25
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:41,790
interoperability testing at ICF meetings

26
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:43,710
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft to their credit has been</font>

27
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,909
buying pizza for these because they

28
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,220
recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

29
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,970
extraordinarily good form of testing for

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,679
them although<font color="#CCCCCC"> it tends to look bad when</font>

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,539
everybody else in the room can fix

32
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,610
whatever the bug was that was just found

33
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,439
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> then and Rickon and run the test</font>

34
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,760
over again where they have to submit a

35
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:02,169
bug

36
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,670
important come back three months<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

37
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,860
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever reason a laptop is not</font>

38
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:16,970
powerful enough to build their dns

39
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:19,160
products but anyway this is this is part

40
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,900
of the seamy underside of the internet

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is first light make such good</font>

42
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">fodder perfect for this this conference</font>

43
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:30,320
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what people in this room</font>

44
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:32,679
do for a living but you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> i made a moment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago is is</font>

46
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,710
fundamental you cannot believe what dns

47
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:42,770
tells you and yet all of us do so take

48
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:46,210
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example a relationship</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between your</font>

where you is there's nothing in your

51
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,350

going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so when you ssh to that</font>

53
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,180
post is going to say gee I just got a

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,500
key that I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

55
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,150
sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to add this to your known</font>

56
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,040
hosts file do you really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font>

57
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,250
to this guy all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us just pretty much</font>

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:09,410
say yes and there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> guarantee that</font>

59
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host you get that key from is the</font>

60
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,720
one that you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to</font>

61
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,850
get the a record that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your assets</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> H</font>

plant seeds to be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

63
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:24,040
from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the internet would</font>

64
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:26,150
say or what you think you're seeing so

65
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,560
in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you had enough</font>

66
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:33,110
things to worry about now the e-commerce

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,350
hold that corresponds to that one is

68
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:38,840
fairly pluggable in that when a browser

69
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,400
goes to some web server somewhere and

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,160
sees a key that it's never seen before

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,959
there's a certification authority that

72
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:49,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">went along with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

73
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,120
certification<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority tends to be</font>

74
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,110
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> always but it can be</font>

75
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,730
hardwired into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the browser itself so</font>

76
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:58,459
that when you get a key your browser

77
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,920
knows whether its manufacturer things it

78
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:03,530
ought to be trusting that and

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,619
furthermore it comes up with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop-up</font>

80
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,790
that says okay I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just saw new</font>

81
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,250
Kate came from uunet communications or

82
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,920
whatever it came from some in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some place</font>

83
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,199
and this is the certification authority

84
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,168
that and my level of trust for them

85
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,780
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that name about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the company name</font>

86
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:26,229
isn't just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> host name anymore and so we</font>

87
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,059
can hope that verisign and the other

88
00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:32,080
certification authorities are not going

89
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,570
to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> joe random cracker incorporated</font>

90
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,789
to have a key that has some other

91
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,070
companies shame in it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

92
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing like that for email nothing like</font>

93
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:48,820
that presses h the rest of the stuff is

94
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:51,820
pretty much wide open and since there

95
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:57,010
are so many script kiddie who is out

96
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,960
there that have this functionality for

97
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:00,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">polluting other people's campus or</font>

98
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,409
spooking their resolvers so that the

99
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:04,870
response<font color="#CCCCCC"> stacy isn't the one that they</font>

100
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought they were waiting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the one</font>

101
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:10,090
you thought they were waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for i I've</font>

102
00:05:08,289 --> 00:05:12,550
included some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them in the vines kit I</font>

103
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,340
figure they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there we</font>

104
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,800
ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have them too but long ago</font>

105
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,539
during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet weren't difficult i</font>

106
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,650
was in favor of releasing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font>

107
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:25,450
code to mr.<font color="#E5E5E5"> morris's tool so a lot of</font>

108
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:27,159
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> were against that lot of people</font>

109
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,780
are against this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have been called a</font>

110
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:33,389
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> names as a result of putting</font>

111
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:37,030
these kiddie toys in the kit<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess on</font>

112
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">my skin is getting thicker anyway you</font>

113
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,448
should download the kit and run the

114
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,919
these tools against your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers</font>

115
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:43,919
just so you'll see how easy they are

116
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:49,500
where do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to go today</font>

117
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,360
and of course the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get are</font>

118
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:06,730
the bottom of the food chain you know

119
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are things that were left on</font>

120
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:12,370
some compromised computer that didn't

121
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,410
automatically delete themselves at the

122
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:19,000
end of an attack I'm sure that there are

123
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:28,180
much better ones available that have not

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:29,950
filtered their way to need yet so that's

125
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,430
the problem statement what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing</font>

126
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">about us well in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usual internet way</font>

127
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,370
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are doing</font>

128
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,260
different things and then in the center

129
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,640
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a bunch of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

130
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:46,950
standards that are extraordinarily

131
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:49,979
painful both to work on and wait for the

132
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:53,380
biggest effort that's been made by

133
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:57,360
organized religion in this area is the

134
00:06:53,380 --> 00:07:01,090
public-private p system known as DNS SEC

135
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,180
and this is a pretty much a normal model

136
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:07,210
of the benefits from the DNS hierarchy

137
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,330
itself so that when you get a referral

138
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,400
telling you that a given branch of the

139
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:16,510
DNS tree should be reached through the

140
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">sand so server you also get the some</font>

141
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of a key that would help you verify</font>

142
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace that when you start talking to</font>

143
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that host you're really talking to the</font>

144
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,650
person that that part of the tree was

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,150
figure out who owns dot and that person

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,760
will sign it and that the public key

149

that corresponds to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

151
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,190
that whenever you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verify you can</font>

00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,190
just look down

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> dot will then not only sign itself</font>

154
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,430
but it will sign its top level domains

155
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,128
like calm<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you and net and so</font>

forth and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the owners of those domains</font>

159
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:10,210
will then assign the second level names

00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:10,210
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6.com or an odd duck</font>

161
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:18,570
with teeth that will allow you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

167
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,849
it is you've got some trusted key that

the name you want or to the name you

171
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:43,080
want then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can figure out the name</font>

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,100
a normal straightforward application of

public key technology to the pns it

178

turns out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is not a minha</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bowl</font>

179
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:11,280
to this so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example when you want to</font>

180
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,020
express a signature you have to make a

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,740
funny thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of like a</font>

some people say this some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say it</font>

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:28,740
isn't it that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of resource record</font>

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:33,560
sorry microphone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going well give</font>

186
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:36,839
you an example the signature is not

187
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,510
unique normally if you know the name

188
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:42,210
class and type of a resource record and

189
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,700
you know the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the resource record</font>

190
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:46,380
set of which it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a part and for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

191
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:49,380
signature that's not true you have to

192
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:52,200
dip into the first short word of the our

193
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,680
data section to get the type<font color="#CCCCCC"> covered</font>

194
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,020
filled out as well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a</font>

195
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,510
quadruple not it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tuple that that</font>

196
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,030
identifies it and that really violates

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:05,490
the model in some interesting ways

198
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,699
that's taken not interesting subtle

199
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:09,430

from the assumption that in a LAN or a

different sneakernet is fine it's

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,589
just fine and it's also just time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,160
have those things not have user accounts

presumably if only such events can log

much mean that resolved<font color="#CCCCCC"> comp would have</font>

254
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,579
to have the shared secret and that

255
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:47,889
because it would have to be a world

256
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:49,930
readable file on posts that have users

257

in microsoft windows 2000 they're going

263
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:19,389
to kind of abandoned wins in a way and

264
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:22,509
here's somebody clapping<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was my</font>

269
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:36,159
time that wins was developed was have a

00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:23,469
forth so they developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called</font>

287
00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:25,449
gssb c which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of the public</font>

288
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:28,049
private thing applied to transaction

289
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:30,368
signatures but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it uses a proprietary</font>

290
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:32,679
format that is based on their

00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:38,769
proprietary format for their version of

292
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:41,639
Kerberos so there's a problem in people

293
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:44,649
who want to sell against Microsoft into

294
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,299
some of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> these corporate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plans</font>

298
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:57,988
doesn't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be possible so</font>

299
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:57,989
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still fighting that out</font>

300
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:11,449
there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been two sets of RFC's</font>

301
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:12,770
describing pianist<font color="#CCCCCC"> act which is the</font>

302
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">first standard i described</font>

303
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:19,400
public-private sort of hierarchy system

304
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,680
and the first one had a lot of problems

305
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,779
the second one has<font color="#E5E5E5"> some problems and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> natural for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC is to go through</font>

307
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:31,400
this kind of gradual improvement what's

308
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit not natural is a fair</font>

310
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,589
implementing the standards didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

311
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,300
bother<font color="#CCCCCC"> to comment on some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier</font>

312
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:43,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">RFC's either because they weren't in the</font>

313
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:49,069
DNS industry yet or they were busy<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

314
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:51,230
other stuff or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the some of the</font>

315
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,640
concept being argued were more important

00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:56,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">to security people than they were</font>

317
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,910
important to DNS people and so it's

318
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:01,160
created kind of a marginal situation

319
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,719
where you know we at the Internet

320
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,150
software consortium are getting around

321
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,070
implement in this stuff and discovering

322
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:10,160
that there are a lot of ways in which it

323
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:14,680
literally cannot work so there will be

324
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least one more RFC before we're done</font>

325
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:20,479
as to whether that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other RFC is</font>

326
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,430
going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete replacement we're</font>

that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bureau of export administration</font>

and what order you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things in</font>

and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apply for an</font>

383
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,520
exemption basically it's it's that's

384
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:24,939
where you admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these are munitions</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are dangerous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can</font>

386
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:29,270
marginalize them and say that they

387
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:32,510
aren't that dangerous and could you

388
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:35,030
please have permission to ship them even

389
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,760
though it's arguably illegal so you

390
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:40,580
start by putting both knees on the

391
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,410
ground and your hands together and

392
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:45,350
they're allowed to do a number of things

393
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:48,920
including say no but if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> say no then</font>

394
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,510
there's an appeals process and they

395
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:52,520
could eventually have to explain why

396
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:55,240
they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no they're also allows</font>

397
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:58,220
not answer or these not<font color="#E5E5E5"> answered for</font>

398
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,520
some number of months it would be bad

399
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:04,300
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us because the is cease funding</font>

400
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,129
model depends on getting this code out

401
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:09,200
so there is another approach which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

402
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,290
what we took which is where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

403
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,880
self-certification where you instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

404
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:15,470
asking their permission you send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

405
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,240
letter saying look I've got this code

406
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,950
looks like it fits some of your

407
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,750
guidelines we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think it fits them</font>

408
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:27,980
all we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ship it if you</font>

409
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:31,460
have a problem with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that let us know now</font>

410
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,890
the form of them letting you know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

411
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,890
that they send the marshals after me and

412
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,600
handcuffed me and take me away it's that

413
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:41,210
they would send us a cease and desist

414
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,250
letter and say you're a bad dog and

415
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,340
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this later but for now</font>

416
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:48,320
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to both</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cut down and we have</font>

417
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:50,270
received<font color="#CCCCCC"> no such letter it's not an</font>

418
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,010
indication that we won't but so far we

419
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:54,889
haven't and we're into our third major

420
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:59,140
tarball that has always code in it so at

421
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,140
the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm starting to feel safe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

422
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:13,490

423
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:18,800
and get rid of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sunglasses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

424
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:21,020
