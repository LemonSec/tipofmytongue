through the rectum side what we're going

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:10,070
to do is we'll go through a little bit

4
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:13,700
higher is that better can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all hear</font>

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,630
first of all here's the cumulative

today from internet and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that</font>

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,269
basically it cumulatively there's about

16
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:46,549
6.2 million entries have been registered

17

this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of goes to net registration</font>

21
00:00:51,589 --> 00:00:57,708
so on and that turns out to be 4.2

22
00:00:55,369 --> 00:01:05,570
million are currently in the database as

23
00:00:57,709 --> 00:01:08,960

the distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nets again overtaking</font>

26
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:22,909
number of the main updates per month we

27
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:25,899
saw a peak in February of 580,000 the

28

main updates performance that month and

29
00:01:25,899 --> 00:01:30,020
went down a little bit in marks but as

30
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:35,089
you can see everything just gradually

31
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:41,210
increases in telephone requests we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all-time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high and in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> March and see how</font>

33
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,949
many that turns out to be 88,000

34
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,298
telephone requests performed in that

35
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,840
particular amount that we actually

answered

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:02:00,070
I'm caveat<font color="#CCCCCC"> e I know who is queries per</font>

38
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,810
month this is interesting number because

39
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:04,600
the restrictions that were put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

40
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,920
ftp access to zones and so on that the

41
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,288
numbers have actually started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

42
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,610
decrease which I find kind of

43
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:14,619
interesting maybe they're finding out

44
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,670
that pressing<font color="#E5E5E5"> CD so this information is</font>

50
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:38,709
I'm very curious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically the</font>

51
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,950
number of queries per second that a

00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:46,239
route that service Nazis as you can see

53
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:49,089
since September of 94 was in about 100

54
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,650
to 200 range is dramatically increased

55
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:55,900
and has seems highs around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2,300 queries</font>

per second run average in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March gone</font>

57
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,820
down a little bit in May that's because

58
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:04,380
it's only partial month and I've seen

59
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:10,420

146
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,080
well to split up or function soon so

149
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:27,719
this where they actually deal with the

00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:31,360
customer face-to-face deal with actual

151

registration related questions responses

152
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,870
actually perform the registrations for

153

information company information and so

155
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:43,270
on the registry on the other hand is

156
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,849
very minimal information basically only

157
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:48,248
has information enough to that cut his

199
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:56,019

200
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,000
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> does occur and I think they're</font>

00:09:56,019 --> 00:10:01,389
finding a number of them supply

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,550
surprised how complex this really is I

203
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:08,199
think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was this idea that it was</font>

204
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,670
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just a template generator</font>

205
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:11,439
and they just submit the template and be

206
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,849
done with it there's actually some more

207
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:18,399
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do as</font>

208
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:22,300
meaning the lists have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> this debate</font>

209
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,970
about who is and spammers ftp access has

finished<font color="#E5E5E5"> more restrictive although</font>

211
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:30,610
lately I've seen rumors that or heard

00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,259
rumors that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business of Pharaohs</font>

notice from home saying indicating that

interesting thing to people who want

this data there's basically two camps

that are basically opposed to each other

229
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:16,389
one being spammers and and also

of the US government but that

301
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,580

over on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this network solutions thing</font>

303
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,900
which then offered me all kinds of

304
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,820
services not related to what I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone</font>

305
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,340
there for and when I complained to you

306
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,840
in the bar you said that oh well we have

307
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:26,480
marketing people in there they're not

308
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,660
under good control and then I noticed

309
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the there was an announcement that</font>

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,310
there would be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new CEO and I wonder is</font>

311
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,170
there any early indication of whether

312
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:39,729
the new CEO is going to do a better<font color="#E5E5E5"> job</font>

313
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:39,729
of controlling the marketing people

314
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:50,400

316
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,430
size job but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> impressed me as being a</font>

317
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,130
technologist and not a marketeer so time

318
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:02,459
will tell and I'm hopeful like you fall

319
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:06,140
that at this thing will become more
