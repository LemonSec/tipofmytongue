00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,389
that you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a microwave and I</font>

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,948

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,210
few slides on the answer them internet

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,030

10
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,950
North American network operations group

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,399
requests from North America nice piece

15
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:55,500
that I don't want more information or

16
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,539
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect to the M some</font>

17
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:01,739
internet exchange so we thought it's a

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,739
good idea to spend some slides here very

19
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,390
short to talk just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few words on the</font>

they're switching hardware and it's sara
