2
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:10,670
have a tendency<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk pretty loudly</font>

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,820
when I'm presenting so honest on the

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,810
morning my name is eric johnson i'm a

00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:28,250
it was a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting ray drive down</font>

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:30,020
for me today I was quite surprised to

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">see if the weather turns so rapidly</font>

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,870
yesterday was an absolutely gorgeous day

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:38,350
and I did see blue peeking through this

14
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:42,739
morning but c'est la vie I was contacted

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:47,359
very late last<font color="#E5E5E5"> week by EJ von schaumburg</font>

00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:51,318
who is one of our liaisons into the 802

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:53,120

I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about today is the is</font>

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:08,630
essentially a state of wireless and I'm

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:10,880
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be focusing on 802 11 and some</font>

24
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:13,100
of its derivatives this is intended to

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,589
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overview and only day I'll need to</font>

26
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,350
get some feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you in a second</font>

27
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:20,990
as to what kind of expertise we have in

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:24,440
the audience but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is not intended to</font>

00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">was one being lowest in five being</font>

00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,890
you fall into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to two category</font>

39
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:56,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay how about the three to four</font>

40
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:58,220

looks about<font color="#CCCCCC"> three to four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is but</font>

57
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,290
are using wireless in and also I'd like

58
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk a little bit about what at least</font>

59
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,370
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my perspective is happening out of</font>

60
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,320
Bell Labs and the guests were very

61
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,400
interesting things developed developing

62
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:55,100
in that area the point I wanted to make

63
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,170
with this slide is that is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

64
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,850
are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> very real reasons why 802 11 is</font>

65
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,359
in the current state that it's in and

66
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:04,430
much of these are driven by good by

67
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,440
people such as yourselves have made

68
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,870
requests for certain levels of

69
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology what we're now seeing as a</font>

70
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:14,900
maturation of 802 11 as far as it as far

71
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,370
as local area networks are concerned and

72
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,430
now we start now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting to see</font>

73
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:23,630
some development of the technology into

74
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,250
the LAN and it is when you start moving

75
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:27,290
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wynn there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

76
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,920
certain limitations in terms of how 802

77
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:33,679
11 operates as a consequence we're not

78
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,750
starting to see an evolution of that

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,900
technology into something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's more</font>

80
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">suited for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> white area network use</font>

kind of a quazy local loop system the

83
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,910
and that technology today is fairly

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:08,359
in respect to how those technologies are

91
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,679
working most importantly I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think for</font>

many of the customers that I've seen

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:18,200
as to why they wide wireless is supplied

of reducing the cost additionally there

290
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:26,810
standards that allows you to swap out

291
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:29,420
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> sets necessary and forth 55.2</font>

00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of development effort taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

294
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,440
in that realm I would expect within the

295
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,149
next 12 to 24 months to see a great deal

296
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,980
that technology starting to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed</font>

297
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:43,180
lot of that has to do with FCC

298
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:49,670
regulations to and opening up that that

299
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:52,699
particular spectrum 802 11 it was formed

300
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a result of a large consortium of</font>

301
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:57,609
industry participation and it was

302
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,470
optimized specifically for land use

303
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">however you're starting to see some</font>

304
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:05,449
starting to see some deployment of this

305
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,519
technology into the LAN and I'm going to

306
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:09,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk here in just a few minutes as to</font>

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,380
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that detect the core</font>

308
00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:13,850
technology itself remains unaltered I

309
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:17,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">won't say unaltered but the core</font>

310
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:20,290
technology remains the same in terms of

311
00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:22,579
transceiver but you start to find

312
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,349
extended application with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:47,000
typical configurations that that you'll

320
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:49,310
say first and foremost as a standard

321
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,190
wireless LAN this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't even</font>

322
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:53,810
even have a that this is really not

323
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:55,160
scalable something like you would use in

324
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,719
this room you'd have a single access

325
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,089
point amor actually no access point

326
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'd have all workstations contributing</font>

327
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:04,910
as part of a of a baseline

328
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:08,900
infrastructure very simplistic not too

329
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:11,780
scalable then you can you can then start

330
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:14,689
applying<font color="#CCCCCC"> wire and actually developing a</font>

331
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,520
small wire based network but still

332
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:19,040
employ some wireless stations within

333
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:21,829
this network I don't see too much of

334
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,579
this but this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

335
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:27,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the applications this is where</font>

336
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:29,660
you'll actually have a wired net and

337
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,060
then you'll have one or perhaps more

338
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:34,130
what I'm calling access points these are

339
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,040
for instance in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the show i believe it</font>

340
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,939
was mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> without 11 access points</font>

341
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,280
throughout the throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hotel</font>

342
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,280
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> this allows</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used to do is</font>

343
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,589
essentially set up set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up some nice</font>

344
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:50,839
frequency or some nice coverage path

345
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,430
regardless of where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are in hotel you</font>

346
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,820
walk around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he'll hey you'll connect</font>

347
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:58,010
up to a point this is typically we're a

348
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,890
great deal of businesses<font color="#CCCCCC"> the commercial</font>

350
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:05,960
at the next slide where we have multiple

351
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,690
what we start to see is a very

352
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:11,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">large-scale</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deployment a number of</font>

universities that we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with are</font>

354
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:16,460
typically deploying this technology and

355
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in doing so using a variety of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different antenna types within the</font>

357
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:23,720
campus itself you'll see a great number

358
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,210
of people connecting up to any

359
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,820
particular access point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as they roam</font>

360
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,210
through the campus and they'll simply

361
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,980
connect through another cell it's a very

362
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:36,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">very scalable some of the universities</font>

363
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,610
that we are working with we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen that</font>

364
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,910
in

00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">gets interesting this is where you take</font>

371
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:04,059
the inherit land oriented technology and

372
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:06,250
by use of for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like a</font>

373
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">yagi or a parabolic in kind of some kind</font>

374
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,559
then you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some point to</font>

375
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:15,040
point service now in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had</font>

376
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:18,879
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of universities who have driven</font>

00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,349
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five up to 30 miles using</font>

380
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,410
using a low actually a moderate gain

381
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,809
antenna like a<font color="#CCCCCC"> yagi which might be</font>

382
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:31,870
between 12 and let's say 16<font color="#CCCCCC"> DBA gain</font>

383
00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:34,270
then you can typically go up to let's

384
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:37,479
say five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six miles I did have one</font>

385
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:40,230
instance where we where lewis university

386
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,040
of colorado where they needed to

387
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,370
university of<font color="#E5E5E5"> denver where they needed</font>

388
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:48,299
to go in extreme distance upwards of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

389
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:51,850
miles and by using a 24 DB gain

390
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:54,250
parabolic we were able to to see about

391
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,110
30<font color="#E5E5E5"> miles of transmission this is really</font>

392
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,470
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> too because if you use those</font>

393
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:04,809
parabolics in a in a in a much closer

394

395
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:10,389
some some problems for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us for some users</font>

396
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:11,950
those those parabolics are very hot and

397
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:17,040
put a chicken in front of that thing it

398
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:20,919
will cook<font color="#CCCCCC"> it despite a little output and</font>

399
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:23,379
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course then what we can do is we can</font>

400
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:24,820
take some directional low gain or

401
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,040
moderate game directional antenna such

402
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,689
as Yogi and then we can we can

403
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,090
essentially point those back line of

404
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:33,309
sight back to an omnidirectional antenna

405
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,600
at a central site this is where I think

406
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:36,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see most of the</font>

application this is where<font color="#CCCCCC"> is peas come</font>

408
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,280
into play this is where were you serving

409
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:45,820
a large campus you'll have a single

410
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,649
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> yogi that's attached to to your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">customer site or to it to the campus</font>

412
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:52,060
site and then you

413
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:58,149
simply go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to the back to your</font>

416
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,919
marketing here let me point out the

417
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,200
different components here these are

418
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,000
typical of any other of any manufactures

419
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,210
that a very low gain internal antenna

420
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,790
here typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find cards in the</font>

468
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,780
interesting thing to we had a at work

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,670
we've been doing some development with

00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,210
omnidirectional vehicle antenna about

00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,059
six to<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight inches tall on top of</font>

474
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,670

00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:25,649
various truck stops or what have you the

476
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:28,320
trucks will automatically register with

477
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,970
the land and then be up and running very

eventually see deployment of 30 megabits

able to to realize throughput about

534
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:08,159

542
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,939
and then if you if you expand it across

543
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,820
a great number of frequencies you start

544
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:31,740
to see where this technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> makeup this</font>

is purely experimental purely in the lab

577
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:50,010
reassembled and put back at her so it

578
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,350
actually exploits multipath this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

579
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:55,230
exciting stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and without getting</font>

not becomes a commercial products I

584
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,639
don't know but it's certainly something

585
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:11,520
that is happening within the wireless

586
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:13,950

shortly and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> download it in PDF</font>

again it's free of charge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is it</font>

611
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,580
that is record time I usually go for

four hours in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stretch I don't think</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">I have any time for questions at this</font>

614
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:26,129
point but I will stick around it but if

615

anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hit me up</font>

616
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:29,150
thank you very much

617
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:42,330
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> great question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ron Craig I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

618
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,070
the mic I was I was thinking maybe we

619
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:46,320
have John go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we have questions</font>

620
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,590
in general or is it is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bill</font>

621
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,970
isn't wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific yeah okay well</font>

622
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:56,279
no we've got to where does talks this

623
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:57,629
morning i'll be happy to yeah yeah okay

624
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">well no way we can answer the question</font>

625
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:02,039
now it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> steven is do you want</font>

626
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,889
me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address the project our looks like</font>

627
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:06,450
I see okay okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> two questions really</font>

628
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:10,019
quickly what we want conceivably<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

629
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:12,119
can't hear you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so um yes introduce</font>

630
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:16,860
yourself i'm bill with that's

631
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:18,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">Steven Stewart um so you're talking</font>

632
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a future in which more and more</font>

633
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:21,749
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point to multipoint and I</font>

634
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,309
agree entirely it looks to me like where

635
00:28:21,749 --> 00:28:26,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">things are going and so we've done a lot</font>

636
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:29,759
of shopping around and I've only<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

637
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:33,269
one product that seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a good</font>

638
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:35,309
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 forwarding table scheme filled</font>

639
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:39,029
into it and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would seem to me to be</font>

640
00:28:35,309 --> 00:28:41,309
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only really sensible way of solving</font>

641
00:28:39,029 --> 00:28:42,749
hidden transmitter problems can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

642
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:44,158
discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a little bit if there are</font>

643
00:28:42,749 --> 00:28:45,600
other things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are happening or if</font>

644
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,159
everybody knows that and they just don't

645
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,539
talk about it or what's the deal there

646
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,950
is uh yeah I heard part of the question

647
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,929
yeah it might might be better down here

648
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,509
if I understand the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> correctly</font>

649
00:28:54,929 --> 00:28:59,460
you're asking about those<font color="#E5E5E5"> low but</font>

650
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:02,159
essentially bridging capabilities but

651
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,110
not necessarily a data at eight will say

652
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,029
an ethernet data link layer is that

653
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:07,949
correct you're looking at essentially

654
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:09,929
establishing a heart hierarchical

655
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:14,369
network and then and bridging between

656
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:16,019
those nodes absolutely again I'm

657
00:29:14,369 --> 00:29:17,610
decidedly non-commercial in this I'm

658
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:19,950
non-partisan but something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

659
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like this access point will</font>

660
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,259
allow you to do that where you can

661
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:28,230
actually create a really network of

662
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:30,600
nodes this particular device and there

663
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:34,950
are a number of other industry products

664
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:37,320
like this will accept<font color="#E5E5E5"> two cards now one</font>

665
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:39,980
can be a card for local

666
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,200
area and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then which is essentially a</font>

667
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,570
call it a point to multipoint that is 0

668
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,340
this will be a central<font color="#E5E5E5"> site going out to</font>

669
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:50,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">a number of different users and then the</font>

670
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:53,309
second card can can establish a network

671
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:56,759
of these devices now that that's that's

672
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:59,129
entirely bridge it's a layer 2 there's

673
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,230
also some proprietary technologies

674
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,669
coming out again breeze calm and blue

675
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:05,370
sent a number of other companies are

676
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:07,909
deploying this which is not 802 11 right

677
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:10,590
now and it allows you to create a

678
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:13,049
hierarchical<font color="#E5E5E5"> network specifically</font>

679
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:15,439
designed for when applications where you

680
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:19,019
can have let's say up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 600 separate</font>

681
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:21,210
nodes consolidating up into let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say 10</font>

682
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:23,399
remote site nodes and then ultimately

683
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:25,200
back into the end of the central<font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier</font>

684
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:28,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">say so you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying that box bridges</font>

685
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,700
but it's number of logical peers is

686
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:35,460
limited by its number of physical

687
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:37,590
interfaces I know well yeah it's this

688
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,419
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular technology in and of</font>

689
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:41,699
itself if you're using a wireless relay

690
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:43,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">network is going to be limited it is</font>

691
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,360
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the by the number of</font>

692
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:46,919
interfaces that you have you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

693
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,649
of the cars<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> serving a local</font>

694
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,419
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second card will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be essentially</font>

695
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:53,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">point-to-multipoint network which allows</font>

696
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:56,879
you to network these devices together

697
00:30:53,129 --> 00:31:00,418
but you're using one frequency you're

698
00:30:56,879 --> 00:31:02,189
using one limited spectrum so while it

699
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:03,899
will work it's not necessarily the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

700
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,110
way to do it probably the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to do</font>

701
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is to have these things a a wired</font>

702
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,820
back into a switch or some other some

703
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,769
other more capable device and let them

704
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,759
simply serve the wireless application

705
00:31:13,769 --> 00:31:18,929
yeah but yes you can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it's</font>

706
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:21,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">their their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> products out there right now</font>

707
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:25,350
that build a forwarding table and choose

708
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,029
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop based on signal strength yes</font>

709
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:31,110
but yeah the right way to do it yes

710
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:32,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely but so a question is that is</font>

711
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:35,158
there a standard for that or is there

712
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,720
more than one vendor doing that there is

713
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,549
more than one vendor doing that is there

714
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,009
a standard for that I to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be honest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

715
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:42,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">you I don't know I can certainly take</font>

716
00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:44,580
your name down and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do is go</font>

717
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:47,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to the back to some of the folks</font>

718
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,990

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,409
questions and additional apologies for

728
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:12,409
the fact that its operational in nature

729
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:14,570
I ran 915 megahertz in my house and the

730
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:16,480
distance between me and where I wanted

731
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:19,490
to be Wireless was<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 30 feet and</font>

732
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,429
life was good and then I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> baby and</font>

00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:24,170

click every time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I press the key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and 9</font>

736
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,189
15 mega hertz which was amusing until i

737
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,780
started getting mail and a megabyte of

738
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:35,750

740
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,070
switched to 2.4 gigahertz and life was

741
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:44,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">good until we started using the</font>

742
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:47,809
microwave oven and when i use the

743
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:51,050
microwave all traffic stops sir when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

744
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:53,320
moved to<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5.2 gigahertz how will I be</font>

745
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,320
screwed

746
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:03,210
that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and while I'm</font>

747
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:06,450
awesome well I can't specifically

748
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,120
address or for that matter predict

749
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:11,399
what's going to happen based on the

750
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">information I've seen when you get the</font>

751
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:15,750
five in the five gig range it's my

752
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:21,090
understanding that there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

753
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:22,980
some immunity to that now again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font>

754
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:24,840
be happy to dig farther into that and

755
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:27,299
and talk to some of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

756
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,860
really know and and get some information

757
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:30,299
for you but it's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding is</font>

758
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:34,469
that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is going to be</font>

759
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:39,029
some rejection of my microwaves in my

760
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:43,409
patience exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ya know now how that</font>

761
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:44,880
affects all 2.4 gig you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

762
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:48,480
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on a vendor by vendor</font>

763
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,679
vendor by vendor basis certainly I would

764
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:54,240
expect that given the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

765
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:56,580
much of this technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> is based honey</font>

766
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:58,770
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-defined and very mature</font>

767
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:04,080
standard that it would all operate the

768
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:06,770
same way but you know now that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

769
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,770
thank you
