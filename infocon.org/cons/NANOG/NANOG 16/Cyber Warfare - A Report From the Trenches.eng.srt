00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:11,490
okay are we ready okay we'll go for it

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,460
okay I've titled my talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber warfare</font>

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,770
report from the trenches cyber warfare I

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:19,289
just grabbed because it was has a lot of

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,529
media hype right now and from the

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,800
trenches we are somebody out there that

7
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,369
are seeing a lot of cyberwarfare type of

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,279
activity and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about some</font>

9
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today I am going to cover the</font>

10
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,989
following topics a little bit of my

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment so you can see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

12
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,899
applies for you or where I'm coming from

13
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,000
a quick review of the problem network

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,579
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> computer and security talk about the</font>

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,390
threat that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of the hacker</font>

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:55,110
and espionage activity coming in over

17
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,730
the internet and I'll summarize what we

18
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,399
do at our organization the response to

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,989
the threat and wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to also bring up a</font>

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,899
topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interactions with</font>

these issues and then talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have known it by other names but</font>

we have been involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in network</font>

one of the early subscribers to the

35
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,780
ARPANET and have seen really a lot of

36
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,979
trends over the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm going to</font>

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,930
talk a little bit about some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

38
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:48,000
this morning I am NOT a security person

39
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,009
or didn't intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a security person</font>

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,799
but because I was operating networks and

41
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,180
was often<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one to discover</font>

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:56,340
attempted intrusions illegal activity

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,530
and so forth ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up getting sucked</font>

44
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,869
into that and it started for me back in

45
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 83 if you remember the good old</font>

46
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,490
days the ARPANET where everybody trusted

47
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,929
everybody we were more concerned about

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make things work than trying</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to make things secure and it's kind of</font>

50
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,360
like your parents

51
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,220
came out the good old days you could

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,690
leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> your doors unlocked and that's</font>

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,489
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't care</font>

54
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">much about even setting good passwords</font>

55
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:20,840
and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> until the wake-up call</font>

56
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:23,329
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually were broken into from</font>

57
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,430
a UCLA student in 1983 just by doing

58
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,130
simple password guessing and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> guessed</font>

59
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,110
the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jones for the user who had</font>

60
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:32,959
a user ID of Jones so it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

61
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:34,700
pretty lame but that's where it started

62
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,610
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and that's gotten more</font>

63
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,869
sophisticated over time and we

64
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,340
historically have been very

65
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-connected so we've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

66
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:48,410
woman on the map for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and are</font>

67
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:50,239
fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> environment inside</font>

68
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:53,299
is very diverse and it makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

69
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,099
hard for us to secure the network being

70
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:57,560
research organizations there's lots of

71
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:59,569
little projects literally hundreds of

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,640
them every little projects has its own

73
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:03,619
type of systems it's on software some

74
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,980
system administrators and so you can't

75
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:09,349
come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> one cookie cutter stamp out</font>

76
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,319
the common configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> of for solaris</font>

77
00:03:09,349 --> 00:03:14,600
or NT<font color="#CCCCCC"> or you pick your operating system</font>

78
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,339
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just intractable and so that that</font>

79
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,820
huge diversity makes it very hard to

80
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,680
secure also they're configured to do

81
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,840
research experimentation they don't a

82
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of sensitive information on so the</font>

83
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,069
notion of the system administrators are

84
00:03:25,549 --> 00:03:29,569
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to worry about security if</font>

85
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:30,768
someone breaks into my computer that's

86
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,298
okay there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing they can really</font>

87
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,880
steal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just reload from the backup</font>

88
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:36,260
tape and they don't realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that having</font>

89
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,760
an insecure computer on the network

90
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:40,608
really makes our whole network

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,649
vulnerable because it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to be</font>

the home for sniffs nippers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> launched</font>

93
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:49,880
other attacks we have fairly high

94
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:53,389
bandwidth to the open<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet and</font>

95
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:56,739
fairly open access we have multiple OC 3

ATM connections to various ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

97
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,220
typically which is different than<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rest of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Navy and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VOD we're</font>

99
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,060
quite open we don't have a bastion host

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,350
firewall per se because it gets in the

101
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the research that's</font>

102
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,329
going on as we interact<font color="#CCCCCC"> with educational</font>

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,489
institutions and other organizations so

104
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:15,470
the result<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we're a very target rich</font>

105
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:18,048
environment and for the hacker community

106
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">they love to break into military sites</font>

107
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:21,919
because of the bragging<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights and being</font>

108
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:25,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to see it in the paper</font>

109
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,460
and being able to claim that they broke

110
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,350
into some kind of a dot mil system seems

111
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:34,729
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the challenge they're all after</font>

112
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:38,330
and to them it's also a game we've

113
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:40,610
noticed that too that just from the type

114
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:42,710
of sweets that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see in the type of</font>

activity<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network it really is a</font>

116
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:47,719
game and I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little bit</font>

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,720
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a minute you all know</font>

118
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:53,360
why we have the problem we do the

<font color="#E5E5E5">computer systems we get are insecure out</font>

figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> them protect them I'm not going</font>

122
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go into a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of detail here also the</font>

123
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:05,240
administrators especially in our

124
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,770
environment don't necessarily have the

125
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,450
training to know how to secure their

126
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,320
machines are not necessarily operating

127
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:14,659
system experts they're usually a

128
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,340
secretary or somebody who's not 100%

129
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,200
busy and they're told you take the

130
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,510
backups on this machine and do the

131
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,890
minimal administration and so often

132
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,440
they're fairly lame and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

133
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,990
clue and we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the whole</font>

134
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">spectrum but it really gives us makes us</font>

135
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,890
more insecure because of that and so

136
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,390
they're not putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the patches</font>

137
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,060
they're not keeping these systems up up

138
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:37,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to date and the other problem we really</font>

139
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,430
struggle with is that our location we're

140
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,560
adding systems vulnerable systems faster

141
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,350
than we can fix them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've got a</font>

142
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,350
chart on that this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> from October</font>

143
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,540
of last year where we were counting the

00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:53,570
number of new computers that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> added</font>

145
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,580
to the network every day and these this

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a monthly quat so you can see it's on</font>

147
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:59,810
the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> of about a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over 100</font>

148
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:03,560
per week's new machines are our network

149
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:06,200
at our site best bluegrass the purple

150
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,700
graph are the number of machines that

151
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:10,219
are determined<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be vulnerable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

152
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,140
every day we look for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

153
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,090
machines that have appeared we do

154
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,289
gullibility scans on them<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to find</font>

155
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:17,929
which ones are vulnerable and usually

156
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,150
it's about a seven percent hit rate now

157
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,700
we have a team that we've put together

158
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:24,859
of about four people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who do nothing but</font>

159
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,150
go around and talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sysadmin to</font>

160
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,440
say your machine is vulnerable please

161
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,349
fix that we're going to shut it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

162
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,210
da da da da and they also offer help to

163
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to fix those machines so the white</font>

164
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,780
graph shows how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those new image</font>

165
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">genes that we're vulnerable actually are</font>

166
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,440
getting fixed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Delta</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

167
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,300
white and the purple graph is expanding

168
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,520
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is to illustrate the point</font>

169
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,830
we can't fix them as fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> as they're</font>

170
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,820
coming on the network so for us that's a

171
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,460
serious problem also the exploit jewels

172
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,570
are readily available once the

173
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,770
vulnerabilities are identified they

174
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:02,670
typically are turned into<font color="#E5E5E5"> an exploit</font>

175
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,349
tool those tools soon show up on the

176
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:06,620
various sites you're probably familiar

177
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,680
with like root shell and and others and

178
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,270
so they are obtainable<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the script</font>

179
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,980
kiddies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> others who want to take</font>

180
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,229
those tools put into a script do massive

181
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:20,160
sweep across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network to try to see</font>

182
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:22,530
what they can break into and this is

183
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,740
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we observe mostly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our fights a</font>

184
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,270
lot of these scans and if there's a

185
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,300
vulnerable machine out there they will

186
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:32,570
find it usually and so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

187
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,130
stay one step ahead of the game and and

188
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:38,849
the reason we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is really a</font>

189
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:40,620
game to them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because when we detect</font>

190
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,860
that someone's breaking in or trying to

191
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,600
break in we do a capture of all the

192
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,310
traffic related to that connection and

193
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,980
we do play backs on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we watch them</font>

194
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,380
and see what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and very</font>

195
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:54,030
typical scenario is you exploit a

196
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:57,840
vulnerability you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root</font>

197
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:00,119
access you replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> login or some</font>

198
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,099
other program with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan version so</font>

199
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can get back in later then you load</font>

200
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like rootkit to replace all</font>

201
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:08,700
the the tools and logs and so forth

202
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:11,280
basically to hide your presence and then

203
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:13,320
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you plug the original</font>

204
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,640
hole so that nobody else can exploit it

205
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,770
and we often<font color="#CCCCCC"> see for example if they</font>

206
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,200
exploited an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IMAP buffer overflow they</font>

207
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,090
will go in and disabled I map so someone

208
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,719
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't get in and use the same</font>

209
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:29,310
vulnerability or we've seen a lot on

210
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,260
solaris machines once they get in and

211
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:34,349
break in they'll actually go to son

212
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:35,789
download the patches fix the machine so

213
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,849
that they fix all the vulnerabilities

214
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,228
for you and after seeing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and</font>

215
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,320
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a number of folks we found</font>

216
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:46,200
that it's all again the hackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> break in</font>

217
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,110
there's competition they want to own the

218
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,850
machine but they want their competitor

219
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,300
not to get in through the same hole and

220
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:57,170
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very very common scenario</font>

221
00:08:53,300 --> 00:09:00,170
it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a big game password</font>

222
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,630
cracking tools are very good and we see

223
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:05,060
a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use those kind</font>

224
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tools you're probably familiar with</font>

225
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,380
crack but if you live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NT world</font>

226
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,850
and the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows world there's</font>

227
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,399
this thing called loft crack which is

228
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,899
pretty amazing and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen</font>

229
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:21,649
it I have a copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so I'll run real</font>

230
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:23,420
quick what I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is went to the NT</font>

231
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:25,640
administrator and I sit and said I want

232
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:27,349
copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password file and he said yes</font>

233
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,220
encrypted you can have it no problem

234
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:35,300
it's safe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I ran this off track</font>

235
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:37,850
thing and I think it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty five</font>

236
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:41,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred and sixty some accounts in it</font>

237
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:44,720
and here's how fast it<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes we're</font>

238
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">already up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to one percent craft and the</font>

239
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is if you look on the</font>

240
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:52,040
half yeah you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you can</font>

241
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,899
immediately spot I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> just by</font>

242
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,760
observing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the encrypted string you can</font>

243
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,560
immediately help if someone has<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven</font>

244
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,029
character or less password<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

245
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,069
the way they break it into chunks of

246
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:04,250
seven for backward compatibility with

247
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:06,980
the the older network protocols so if

248
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,680
you see the right hand side ad3d for

249
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,959
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know instantly it's seven</font>

250
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,800
characters or less and so then you've

251
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:16,939
just changed the shortened the domain of

252
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,920
what you have to try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> brute force</font>

253
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:21,949
attack the seven characters or less for

254
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,599
all of those that appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that format</font>

255
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:26,689
and there's various other bull<font color="#CCCCCC"> gossiped</font>

256
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,430
ease in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the encryption</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm for</font>

257
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,480
example they store everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in</font>

258
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:34,399
all uppercase in just for the backwards

259
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,130
compatibility so that's all you have to

260
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,149
really try for alpha only so some of the

261
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:42,740
some of them that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> characters</font>

262
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:45,079
or less you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can break almost instantly</font>

263
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,370
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by trying just upper case we're</font>

264
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,649
already up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hundred and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

265
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,320
passwords crack I let this run one night

266
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:53,089
just on<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> laptops at home and by</font>

267
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,470
the next morning I had I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

268
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:56,230
eighty-nine percent of our passwords

269
00:10:54,470 --> 00:11:01,330
crack just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our own</font>

270
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:03,340
so if you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahold of an NT off of</font>

271
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,580
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> domain controller or by sniffing or</font>

272
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,860
whatever get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold of a password file</font>

273
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:12,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">its you're in you can get password very</font>

274
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,080
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we see scanners installed</font>

275
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,170
whenever somebody breaks into a machine

276
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:19,450
they put on a scanner scan for the

277
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">install sniffers to gather password so</font>

278
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:25,840
they can run crack but then scanners<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

279
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:28,030
look for vulnerable course on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the</font>

280
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:30,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">various machines on the network we see</font>

281
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,319
rootkit used a lot a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of denial of</font>

282
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,880
service attacks buffer overflow attacks

283
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,790
and so forth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure you're</font>

284
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:39,490
probably familiar with those but the

285
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:44,260
trend we've seen which is very a great

was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very rare event and we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spent</font>

290
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,840
weeks writing reports why the break-in

291
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,500
happened doing all the analysis and so

292
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,540
forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now the activity is to the</font>

point<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have at least one major</font>

00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:12,760
somebody actually broke in it's just

297
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,860
really expanding fast and a lot of the

298
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,439
probes we see a single probe will will

299

and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are just these kids</font>

302
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,720
that downloads the scripts are put

303
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,100
together scripts with the exploit will

304
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,710
scan the whole network looking for

305
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,840
vulnerabilities and it's also becoming

306
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,660
more and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sophisticated these the</font>

307
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,600
script tools are put together in these

308
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,069
nice little packages which will sweep an

entire network<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for all the</font>

310
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:42,490

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:49,270
fast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact sometimes better than</font>

some of the commercial software I have a

313
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:55,660
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different pictures here this</font>

314
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:58,150
one is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> activity we've seen since</font>

315
00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:02,170
august of last year and we categorized

316
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:04,120
it by foreign and domestic the blue on

317
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:08,920
the bottom is domestic the purple<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

318
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,690
foreign so mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's its foreign</font>

319
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,870
usually a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

320
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,970
more than the domestic attacks and what

321
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:18,380
you see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a continuing trend like</font>

322
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:20,600
last year it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a lot less as</font>

323
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,920
indicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> august-september but since</font>

324
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,200
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time there's been a largely</font>

325
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">panas stayed fairly static at a fairly</font>

326
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:34,380
high rate and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is</font>

327
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:37,620
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep fairly good track of exactly</font>

328
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,900
each one of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> incidents and put them</font>

329
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,680
in the law in a log on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web so other</font>

330
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:45,480
people can look at them and it helps in

331
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the analysis to compare</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with what other</font>

332
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,360

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the activity in this month at our</font>

336
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,590

349
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,360
where somebody actually broke in it

350
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,330
didn't exploit a vulnerability but in

351
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,680
this case somebody gets the password or

352
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:51,060
must have guessed her password because

353
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,930
some what we saw somebody tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them it</font>

354
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:57,420
held that in and we've got our our

355
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:59,370
profiles on our analysis tools tuned to

356
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,780
look for certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in this case we</font>

357
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,930
caught them downloading some hacker

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,970
tools just the login itself looked very

359
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,680
normal and it was the fact that they

360
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,720
tried using some of the tools that we

361
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,969
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> newer hacker tools that we were</font>

362
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,380
able to catch them and got the user to

363
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,080
change their password so it again it

364
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,270
reiterates static passwords are bad it

369
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:29,010
mean here's some more from Hungary we

370
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,590
had a smurf last week and so fairly

371
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:37,200
typical of what a lot of other people

372
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:38,970
are seeing I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

373
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,460
minutes to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some specific</font>

374
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:44,370
examples tell some stories things that

375
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,320
we've seen over the years out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">interest in probably for entertainment</font>

377
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,460
to the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had a lot of notoriety a</font>

378
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,980
few years ago was the was el<font color="#E5E5E5"> ratón who</font>

379
00:15:53,460 --> 00:16:00,590
was from Argentina and we first

380
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:03,780
discovered him in 95 and what we saw was

381
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:06,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">activity into a number of our machines</font>

382
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,880
he actually broke in to some and he was

383
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique in that he hung around a lot of</font>

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,080
the incidents are people come in they'll

385
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:15,360
break in put in Trojans and they go away

386
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might never see him again but</font>

387
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,800
elgart snow hung around for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

388
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:22,380
he was coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to us through Harvard</font>

389
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,290
University and we weren't sure where he

390
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,000
was coming into Harvard from but what we

391
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,180
did has got some cooperation with

392
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,860
Harvard letting us look at their logs

393
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:33,180
and saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he was actually connecting</font>

394
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,360
to a lot of places around the country

395
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:38,910
and and foreign countries as well and

396
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,930
what was particularly scary as we

397
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:44,280
discovered them and very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very few others</font>

398
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,140
noticed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the activity so we were</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">remember one in particular which is</font>

403
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:55,260
machines at JPL and we call the sysadmin

404
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,500
there and said your machines have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

405
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:00,330
broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> into he insisted that his</font>

machines were all secure he could not

407
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:04,860
get broken into so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell him go</font>

408
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:07,560
look on this machine look in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> file</font>

you'll find this file<font color="#E5E5E5"> main and and and</font>

410
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,659
here's the contest because we captured

411
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,010
it on the fly and so he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> although he</font>

412
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,520
went and called about five minutes later

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:19,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">he says oh dear we got a problem and</font>

414
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,579
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought he did not have a</font>

00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:50,549
the first time there was ever a legal

428
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">court-ordered wiretap on a network and</font>

429
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:54,910
so it was precedent setting in that

430
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,010
sense and we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use some special</font>

431
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:59,559
software which first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all detected</font>

432
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,179
what his connection was by the type of

433
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:02,799
activity he had because he was coming in

434
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,600
through a dial-up and there's literally

435
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,460
tens of thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users all on this</font>

436
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,080
one network we had to isolate us so we

437
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,299
didn't see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> students traffic</font>

438
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,799
but only his traffic and once<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

439
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:15,879
that got the court order we were able to

440
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:18,700
track him down and eventually late in

441
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,200
that year his computers were confiscated

442
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,120
they broke into his apartment and

443
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,070
confiscated all that stuff and part of

444
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,649
the reason we got the cooperation from

445
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,689
Argentina was that he also broke into

446
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,240
their telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> pbx is down there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

447
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:36,220
was using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to call Harvard's dial us</font>

448
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:38,080
and her Pam<font color="#CCCCCC"> break in from their next</font>

449
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,110
door oh by the way he eventually pleaded

450
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,970
guilty just a few months ago so that he

451
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,290
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a chance to come to the</font>

452
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:46,299
United States again because otherwise he

453
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:51,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">would have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arrested the next time</font>

454
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:54,460
he came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the States China we saw some</font>

455
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,649
telnet activity into one of our machines

456
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,970
in Hawaii and this machine happen to be

457
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:03,700
a mail server also and we saw this

458
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:06,370
Chinese person logging in as an admiral

459
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:08,290
one of the Admirals accounts and going

460
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,549
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this Admirals email and we were</font>

461
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:11,649
wondering what's this Admiral doing in

462
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:13,780
China because we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know any</font>

463
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:15,640
Admirals there and we called it the

464
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,830
Admiral said are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in China oh no he</font>

465
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:23,500
was in Okinawa what we found out is that

466
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:26,678
how he normally read his mail was eudora

467
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,840
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> pop dialing up a local isp which</font>

468
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,340
happened to route through Japan we were

469
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:34,000
eventually able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out that it</font>

470
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,610
was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ISPs in Japan who had a</font>

471
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,679
sniffer somewhere and passwords were

472
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,959
captured somehow the Chinese got that

473
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:42,490
information the Chinese were then using

474
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,040
that information to get into his

475
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,800
accounts get helmet reads email the

476
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,800
thing that alerted us to it was

477
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:53,080
we saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> change in pattern we normally</font>

478
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,970
only saw pop activity from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

479
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,949
now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a sudden from another country</font>

480
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:58,900
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pelmet activity and that set</font>

481
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,980
off some alarms and so we knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

482
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,420
stuff was happening but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> static</font>

483
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,140
passwords are vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should not</font>

484
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">go out in the clear we saw a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

485
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:13,540
problems last year with<font color="#E5E5E5"> IMAP</font>

486
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,060
vulnerabilities there was some buffer

487
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:18,040
overflow problems and there was some

488
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:20,679
exploit tools out there we saw a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

489
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:23,290
sweeps of the network port 143 just

490
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:26,530
looking for I nap and what we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

491
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:29,909
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SIS admins that were 20 putting</font>

492
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:31,899
up linux machines in the 50 51 52 days

493
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,850
all those machines<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this</font>

494
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,800
vulnerability the hackers are finding

495
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:38,350
him breaking into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IMAP court and</font>

496
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,000
here was a case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dubbed um sets with</font>

497
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,560
administrators when they installed linux

498
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,270
that said do you want all the services

499
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,770
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they said sure cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turned</font>

500
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,990
everything on whether they needed it or

501
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,150
not and so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ports were wide open</font>

502
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,640
they didn't patch anything or no even

503
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,770
aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I map was there even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turned</font>

504
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,020
on and so all the systems were getting

505
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:58,930
hacked and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

506
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,629
putting installing sniffers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Trojan</font>

oisin capturing passwords trying to

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:06,390
break into other machines so it read

one that was discovered<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a while</font>

514

back already<font color="#E5E5E5"> where phf it's a piece of</font>

515
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,580
test software that comes with the Apache

516
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,320
web server and it had a vulnerability

517
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:29,409
that you could literally ask it for any

518

file and<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a web browser if you</font>

519
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:34,060
know the appropriate incantation you

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,550
could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say give me the password file</font>

521
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:40,600
and you get it instantly in text very

522
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:43,750
easy to exploit and we saw a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

523
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">people trying to attempt to exploit that</font>

00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">most sites did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is they just turn it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,710
our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> p</font>

532
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:07,510
which was made to look like the real one

533
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:10,450
you want a password file will give you a

534
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:12,550
password file but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got was a</font>

535
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:14,380
password file that had lots of passwords

536
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,260
in it and they were guaranteed to be non

537
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,430
crackable it was sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of random</font>

538
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,379
gibberish for the encrypted string and

539
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:23,290
so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoping to tie up their crack</font>

540
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:25,180
engines and waste their time but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

541
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,830
also did is<font color="#E5E5E5"> while we had him online we</font>

542
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,600
asked their browsers lots of interesting

544
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:36,010
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> other stuff exploit lots of browser</font>

546
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,370
on that because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if this</font>

547
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:40,570
legal or not but I figure if you're

548
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:43,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at us we can look at you</font>

550
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,590
tool because we've gathered lots of

551
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:50,620
information from that the next one

552
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:53,220
happened just a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago we</font>

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,590
this on an ftp server now when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw</font>

570
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,270
this we kind of laughed about it and it

571
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,310
was funny and we hung it up on the wall

572
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,920
and said this is cool is it isn't this

573
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:52,960
funny the problem is one of the local

574
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:56,170
investigator types got a hold of this

575
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,410
and he<font color="#CCCCCC"> went paranoid he took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing</font>

576
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:01,900
and actually wrote up an official secret

577
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,700
incident report which went way up the

578
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,590
chain saying that we had gotten broken

579
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,790
into and the Serbians have taken over

580
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:10,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">all our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> computers and it just shows how</font>

581
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:13,090
paranoid so people can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they don't</font>

582
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:14,800
understand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when we got called</font>

583
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,080
into the captains office has said you

584
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,490
didn't

585
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,590
tell me we got broken into by the

586
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,730
Serbians where we were told we're

587
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,769
supposed to be on alert and<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking</font>

588
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:22,940
for this stuff and I said well do you

589
00:24:21,769 --> 00:24:24,529
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did oh yeah they broke</font>

590
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,149
into our computers they crashed

591
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:28,880
everything and it's the Serbians have

592
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:30,678
just taken over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world I says no they</font>

593
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,659
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our anonymous FTP server well</font>

594
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,730
what's that and I explained to them this

595
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:36,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the equivalent of someone just</font>

596
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:38,570
walking in off the street not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

597
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,010
coming past the guard shack through the

598
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,899
guard gate but just on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bulletin</font>

599
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,760
board outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security perimeter</font>

600
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:45,168
just posting this piece of paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

601
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,240
bulletin board now would you consider

602
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:49,039
that a major break in well of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

603
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,860
but they didn't understand the

604
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:53,899
technology and so they went paranoid and

605
00:24:51,860 --> 00:25:05,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">rolled up huge incidents report over</font>

606
00:24:53,899 --> 00:25:07,428
just a single file printer hacking we

607
00:25:05,049 --> 00:25:10,789
used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think printers were not a</font>

608
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:12,980
problem what could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to printer you</font>

609
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:16,519
can send files to it the worst is maybe

610
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:20,380
denial service attack by just wasting

611
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,380
all the paper constantly jamming it up

612
00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:28,760
until one day a few months ago in

613
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:30,320
tracking down a problem we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

614
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,000
this one particular printer this user

615
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,889
was queuing or print outs to it and

616
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,899
there was a long delay before the paper

617
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:39,080
would come out and when we were doing

618
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:41,928
the analysis we found out that they

619
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,178
would go to the printer and then because

620
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:46,220
of some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had been modified in</font>

621
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:48,980
the printer the printout went to Russia

622
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,840
and then the Russians<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent it back to</font>

623
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,820
the printer after they made a copy of

624
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,408
course and then it eventually came out

625
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:56,960
so the user just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought it was a local</font>

626
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem networks kind of slow but the</font>

627
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,570
Russians had somehow hacked into this

628
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:04,490
printer and redirected the output and

629
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,889
then refute it against to make it look

630
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:08,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">like nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was happening and and when</font>

631
00:26:06,889 --> 00:26:12,649
we really started looking at it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

632
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:15,769
that printers these days they do SNMP

633
00:26:12,649 --> 00:26:19,070
they have helmet they have password ftp

634
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:21,289
they have web pages persistent

635
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,720
administration's you can go in through

636
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,908
various means or if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jet</font>

637
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,130
admin software you can go to the port

638
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:28,960
9101

639
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,520
it is and and do lots of interesting

640
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">things for the printer people installing</font>

641
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,460
printers didn't change the password

642
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,810
didn't turn anything off just plug the

643
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,930
printer in did the bare minimum

644
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:39,669
necessary for makeup work had no idea

645
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:41,980
the security vulnerabilities until we

646
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:43,990
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a lot of the activity</font>

647
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,360
over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last couple of months and so</font>

648
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:47,830
we've tried fixing this problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

649
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,389
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard because we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found the</font>

650
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:53,379
printer vendors don't know how to secure

651
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:55,990
their stuff the older very oldest

652
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,730
printers have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things like</font>

653
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords and so forth embedded in the</font>

654
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:01,360
firmware and you can't get upgrades to

655
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:03,010
it so you literally can't fix it you

656
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,209
have to block it with router filters or

657
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:06,910
something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it can't get</font>

658
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:10,290
beyond a local<font color="#CCCCCC"> network the some of the</font>

659
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:12,760
newer printers the canon copier /

660
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,040
printers with the network interfaces

661
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,020
they're all so bad you cannot protect

662
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,730
the darn things you can't change the

663
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,379
passwords turns off the services and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

664
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:22,270
forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that but not to</font>

665
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,100
the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it secure and so we</font>

666
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,070
had to ban some of those off of our

667
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:29,260
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it was another wake-up call a</font>

668
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:32,919
few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and it turned out to be a</font>

669
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:35,560
real tough problem for us to fix and

670
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:38,710
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the lack of support</font>

671
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:43,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">mainly from the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> printer vendors another</font>

672
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:45,570
story<font color="#E5E5E5"> Melissa virus that was a lot of</font>

673
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">notoriety over the last month or so and</font>

674
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:51,010
in this case what I think was

675
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,889
interesting is how different people

676
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:57,340
reacted to it how p how quickly people

677
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:59,860
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to respond to it be the fleet</font>

678
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:01,470
response that is this is the operational

679
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,120
fleet<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> navy that has just</font>

00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,340
moving around they thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were</font>

681
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">very successful because they discovered</font>

682
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:11,080
it quickly and were able to within a few

683
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:15,580
hours go through all the networks and

684
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,230
eradicated the<font color="#E5E5E5"> marines thought they were</font>

685
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,389
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful because when they</font>

686
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:24,250
detected it they instantly were able to

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:25,690
unplug from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and and i</font>

688
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually was in a meeting last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week</font>

689
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:31,510
where the head navy guy in charge of

690
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,160
security and the head marine guy were

691
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:35,140
arguing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the navy guy</font>

692
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,610
said what we heard your general couldn't

693
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,130
get his<font color="#CCCCCC"> email for three days because you</font>

694
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,659
unplug from

00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,550
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet oh yeah but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this shows how</font>

696
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,930
secure we are because we only have two

697
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:43,700
attachment points<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could instantly</font>

698
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:46,100
unplug them and arguing back and forth

699
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:48,520
about whether this was good or bad to be

700
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:51,320
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly unplug from the internet</font>

701
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,990
now most people think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a bad</font>

702
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,610
thing because what a great way to have a

00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">denial of service attack if just you</font>

Marines unplug from the world but

706
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:06,440
believe it or not this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way DoD is</font>

707
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:08,510

it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like that could be old male</font>

00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,500
wanted to instantly unplug in case of an

715
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:24,290
attack but so much stuff breaks in the

716
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,380
process and<font color="#CCCCCC"> relying so heavily</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on those</font>

717
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:29,540
networks that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a bad thing so</font>

718
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,540
it really is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to turn into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a denial</font>

719
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:35,360
of service there was some scary things

720
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:37,510
about Melissa because of the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

721
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,639
generated especially for some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

722
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:42,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">shifts which have very low bandwidth it</font>

723
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,330
clogged up a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the channels and so</font>

724
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,090
it was definitely a denial of service

725
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:49,490
and so on right what we do at our site

726
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,550
is we try to minimize the scope<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

727
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:55,910
problem we can't use firewalls our place

728
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:57,860
because typically they slow down the the

729
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:59,690
traffic to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet the typical</font>

730
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bastion post type of firewall is just</font>

731
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:05,000
way too slow and so we put a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

732
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:07,100
effort into intrusion detection doing

733
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,510
vulnerability assessments scanning our

734
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,120
networks on a regular basis especially

735
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:13,060
on the new machines using commercial

736
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,040
software and also some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own tools</font>

737
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,419
doing risk analysis have had that team

738
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,920
of four people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because just go</font>

739
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:21,290
around and do nothing but system cleanup

740
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,400
and certification try to do awareness

741
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:23,980
training so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the system</font>

742
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,880
administrators have more of a clue and

743
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:27,760
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep ourselves out of the</font>

744
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,590
newspaper which is sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

745
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,870
but what we actually do is we we try to

746
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,820
put an appropriate spin on it and get to

747
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the press before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they get to us so if we</font>

748
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">know of an incident blex they call them</font>

749
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:40,100
up and say hey we're good guys we

750
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:42,080
discovered it rather than then call us

751
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,820
and say did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know and then if you</font>

752
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know then well you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got broken into</font>

753
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:48,010
and you get a very negative spin and so

754
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:49,560
will often be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones to call them and</font>

755
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:53,010
try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get the</font>

756
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:56,429
that's been now we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say about</font>

757
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:57,660
working with some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ISPs when we</font>

758
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:59,760
see an incident somebody's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

759
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:03,750
break in doing scans or whatever we'll

760
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:07,170
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the ISP that's closest to the</font>

761
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:08,520
intruder and so we can contact<font color="#E5E5E5"> them say</font>

762
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,380
did you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening here's the</font>

00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:12,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">information here's the logs if you could</font>

764
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the next step and find this guy and</font>

765
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,070
shut them down or do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever is</font>

766
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:20,220
appropriate for your AUP then we'd

767
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:22,590
appreciate thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much now a lot</font>

768
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,630
of the ISPs there's no response to the

769
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:25,800
emails we send maybe we're sending to

770
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:28,920
the wrong address maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

771
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:31,560
where to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it to but we try our best</font>

772
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appropriate points of contact</font>

773
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,370
and still a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

774
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:37,889
replies a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them also have</font>

775
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:39,270
automated replies and that's it got your

776
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,380
message thank you very much we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

777
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:42,629
back to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you never hear</font>

778
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,850
anything else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little over fifty</font>

779
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:47,250
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do respond and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if some</font>

780
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:51,120
of some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that do respond we even</font>

781
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,860
get final closure they'll say not only

782
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:55,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">did we take your information that we</font>

783
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,110
track the guy down and and we shut them

784
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:00,840
off our network or yeah one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

785
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,610
machines was hacked and we were being

786
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,949
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit vulnerabilities and so</font>

787
00:32:02,610 --> 00:32:06,810
forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've closed our holes and so</font>

788
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:10,490
forth and so it's nice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

789
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:12,450
closure is and here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relative</font>

790
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,310
comparison<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> types of</font>

791
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:16,620
responses thirty percent no response at

792
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:19,440
all sixteen percent we just get the auto

793
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:22,260
reply and nothing else thirty-one

794
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:25,200
percent we get a personal reply somebody

795
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:27,150
actually responded and twenty-three

796
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,190
percent not only do to get a personal

797
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:31,770
reply but they pulled us what the final

798
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:34,140
action was which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and so we're</font>

799
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:37,980
kind of all over the map here and it

800
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:40,980
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice to increase the green one</font>

801
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:42,990
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> too to have closure on a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

802
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:46,080
these rather than that either no

803
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:48,180
response or just the auto reply and so

804
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,919
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one take-home point</font>

805
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,650
for you all is it would be nice to raise

806
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,700
the bar on how ISPs cooperate with one

807
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:55,050
another I know it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

808
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,000
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially tracking down</font>

809
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,550
denial of service attacks with IP

810
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,480
spoofing but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could cooperate share</font>

811
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:04,370
information in in better ways

812
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,620
have good points of contact and so forth

813
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:09,469
then it would really help this problem

814
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,290
and so here's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that my</font>

815
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:14,809
suggestions personal response is desired

816
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,399
that is not just an auto reply but

817
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:18,410
somebody actually contacting us back

818
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,260
saying you're working on the problem and

819
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:23,809
email or voice is fine and then the

820
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,370
closure what was the outcome what action

821
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:27,200
was taken to define the guy or<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you</font>

822
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,830
find the vulnerable machine and take

823
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,270
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it it's also fun to share tools</font>

824
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:33,620
if somebody's broken into a machine they

825
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,418
usually have a bunch of hacker tools

826
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:36,709
exploit tools if we can take those and

827
00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:38,540
share with each other that's nice

828
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:40,160
because then we can look inside see what

829
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:42,740
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing see if it compares to</font>

830
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,910
what's posted on the hacker boards and

831
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,860
so forth see if there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something new</font>

832
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:49,820
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's nice to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

833
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:52,159
do that taking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to respond even</font>

834
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">though it may seem like you know why</font>

835
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,340
should I help these Navy guys track<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

836
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,929
there intruder I think it really

837
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">benefits the whole community if we do</font>

838
00:33:56,929 --> 00:34:02,720
cooperate and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really a two-way</font>

839
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:04,159
street<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if some if these script</font>

840
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,850
kiddies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hackers are trying to break</font>

841
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,168
into other machines at art<font color="#CCCCCC"> through our</font>

842
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:11,540
location they're probably breaking into

843
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:14,719
other places as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it helps the</font>

844
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:16,159
whole community if we just really try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

845
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,418
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as much as possible or at</font>

846
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,119
least build tools to track them down

847
00:34:17,418 --> 00:34:21,888
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned before</font>

848
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,310
finding the pocs for US isn't always

849
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:27,050
easy and we rely heavily on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

850
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:29,719
who is based registry<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ones</font>

851
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:34,490
you can get to internet and Nick and

852
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:36,500
Aaron and others and so it would be nice

853
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:38,209
if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a great registry in the sky</font>

854
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,369
to said here's all the abuse or security

855
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,800

that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice the worst are Japan</font>

bit more consistency some of the trends

884
00:35:49,059 --> 00:35:54,309
we're seeing in the Department of

885
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:57,098
Defense in terms of trying to protect

886
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:58,990
our networks one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

887
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:04,059
people are excited about right now is

<font color="#E5E5E5">pki and using certificate-based tools to</font>

forth not only for the digital signature

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:26,039
relies more and more on things like

email for doing real<font color="#CCCCCC"> life operations</font>

896
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,880
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit scary knowing how easy</font>

00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:33,339
it is to spoof the<font color="#E5E5E5"> from line and various</font>

you're from some Admiral now go fire

900
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:39,849
here or fire there and that kind of

901
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,420
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the network is a bit of a</font>

902
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:45,220
concern so using<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like s mine</font>

903
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,369
would help a lot it turns out that one

of the recent conflicts in the Middle

there were only three that were sent

usually it takes hundreds or thousands

910

to have an operation there were three

911

914
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,868
the whole war was run an email and so if

915
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">you think about that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how insecure</font>

non-protected email is it something

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,529
beauty ought to be worrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

918
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:22,480
looking at VPN technology to try to

when they talk about network security

932
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,640
and right now it's called information

anything they just generate policy and

937
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,589
not much else and also there's these new

938
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,319
computer network defense teams that are

939
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:09,609
being stood up it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> every time</font>

940
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,109
there's a big incident they get together

941
00:38:09,609 --> 00:38:12,369
what do we need oh I need to do isn't a

respond but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they end up being very</font>

bureaucratic and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very helpful</font>

946
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,309
especially now that we've got so many of

these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't coordinate too</font>

948
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:28,240
well and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better there we</font>

949
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:30,490
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a good perimeter</font>

950
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,069
defense with defense in depth that is

951
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:34,899
multiple security perimeters and usually

952
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:37,540
the outside perimeter is a very strong

953
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:41,140
firewall like rows of bastion host for

954
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:44,049
scalability and things like pics boxes

955
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:45,910
and multiple VPNs around the sides and

956
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:47,680
outer routers and inner routers and

957
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:50,680
intrusion detection that if you see the

958
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,000
map on this thing is it's almost you

959
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:54,339
know whole network infrastructure in

960
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,859
itself just the security piece of it and

961
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:59,319
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if that's a good solution</font>

962
00:38:56,859 --> 00:39:01,450
or not because going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be so complex</font>

963
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:02,529
that do we really really understand

964
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,720
what's inside and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

965
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:09,220
vulnerabilities are but that's the way

966
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,629
maybe is heading a lot of policies and

967
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,529
procedures that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to put up with</font>

968
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:15,730
warning banners as an example their

969
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:17,500
deities all paranoid about warning

970
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,809
banners every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single computer has to</font>

971
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,339
have a warning banner on it and you can

972
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:25,020
understand that for some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

973
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:27,549
they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do but some of the</font>

974
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,369
systems that we have where they demand a

975
00:39:27,549 --> 00:39:31,869
warning banner there's no place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

976
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,520
the warning banner<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like they want</font>

977
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,470
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> email secured well okay where do I</font>

978
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,250
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the imax court there's no</font>

979
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:39,020
way to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> banner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oil but</font>

980
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:41,060
do it anyway because policy and so a lot

981
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:43,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> brain-dead thinking there and also</font>

982
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we found is that I think there's</font>

983
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,130
really a law enforcement under current

984
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,640
here because the warning banners<font color="#CCCCCC"> did you</font>

985
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:54,170
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give them license to</font>

986
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:56,270
bypass all the privacy laws so that they

987
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,350
can snoop on our networks as much as

988
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:02,150
they want also web content and access is

989
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:03,380
a big deal when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they started looking</font>

990
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:05,750
around the network and saw how much

991
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:10,670
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> was given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away freely on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

992
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:13,400
web including operational information

993
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:15,410
that was pretty scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> they decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

994
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,210
time to shut that down so a lot of

995
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,940
disconnecting of web servers from the

996
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:21,560
network or at least protecting them info

997
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">con is a new term you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might start</font>

998
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,560

1002
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:37,610
forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know heightened awareness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> at infocomm alpha right now</font>

1004

this very official thing and say you

1019
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,100
must respond and look at every single

1020

send a report back within 15 days or

1022
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,900
whatever and it's just a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1023
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:19,550
bureaucracy for us hardening of the

1024
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,590
network infrastructure a lot of

1025
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:23,210
attention given to trying to secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1026
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:25,520
routing protocols you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

1027
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:29,380
easy they are to spoof that's kind of

1028
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,120
scary also they want a better<font color="#CCCCCC"> I na</font>

1029
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:33,140
identification and authorization

1030
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,150
capability and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network devices the</font>

1031
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:36,620
routers the switches etc should just be

1032
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,470
able to tell that telnet into them with

1033
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:42,109
an insecure password or whatever and

1034
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,879
also there's a desire<font color="#E5E5E5"> to own the ATM</font>

1035
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:45,590
infrastructure what I mean by that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1036
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,950
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want you just to buy an ATM</font>

1037
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:50,540
service because there is no<font color="#CCCCCC"> security in</font>

1038
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,120
the signaling<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routing domain in</font>

1039
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:56,840
the ATM world and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it</font>

1040
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:59,390
it's really fairly easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put up</font>

1041
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:01,820
circuits create the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nile service attacks</font>

1042
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:05,450
by preserving all the bandwidth doing

1043
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,950
other bad things and so there's policy

1044
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,620
coming down that says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do ATM</font>

1045
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,330
don't subscribe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you have to build</font>

1046
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">it yourself and run it over a sonnet</font>

1047

layer or something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font>

1048
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:20,930
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last slide some of our</font>

1049
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:23,720
concerns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and issues the lack of security</font>

1050
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:25,370
tools for ATM is getting to be more and

1051
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,899
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> especially we and VOD</font>

1052
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:31,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean our network has 0 c 3-8 p.m. to</font>

1053
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,810
the internet that's how we how we

1054
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,600
connect to the outside world and and

1055
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:37,340
what we have to do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring it down to</font>

1056
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,080
100 HP or fitty or something like that

1057
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,550
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that we can use standard</font>

1058
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,009
commercial devices to do intrusion

1059
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:45,950
detection and we'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1060
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:47,930
that and so anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has ideas we're</font>

1061
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:50,029
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

1062
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:51,589
taking the ocx<font color="#CCCCCC"> mon stuff and tweaking it</font>

1063
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,780
to break out some of the streams and

1064
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:56,560
then feeding it into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hundred</font>

1065
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,900
megabit solutions and there's some

1066
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,210
case that's going to work also the

1067
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,640
denial of service attacks are a real

1068
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:05,230
concern especially protecting our

1069
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:09,759
networks and then tracking the intruders

1070
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:11,860
if for us in the DoD if you think about

1071
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,890
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fleet and how heavily it relies on</font>

1072
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,960
the network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're they're very</font>

1073
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:19,299
constrained network connections the

1074
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,400
biggest shifts the<font color="#CCCCCC"> carriers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

1075
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,720
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the t1 and it goes through</font>

1076
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:27,880
a satellite so small pipes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> hydel a</font>

1077
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,839
most the ships have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64k and some have an</font>

1078
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,550
awful<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot less and so it's very easy to</font>

1079
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:37,090
shut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those networks just by</font>

1080
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:38,560
overloading it also as was<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned in</font>

1081
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:41,560
one of the earlier talks the IP spoofing

1082
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:43,420
is especially hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> track and even</font>

1083
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,640
using tools like das tracker that's

1084
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,220
great but it relies on certain hooks and

1085
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">cisco software which we found out is a</font>

1086
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,660
little bit different in every version

1087
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:55,839
and so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a good solution it may</font>

1088
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,520
be better now but it's just very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1089
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,870
painful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to track those type of things</font>

1090
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:03,400
down so any ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be great</font>

1091
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:06,220
the Navy is using insecure and

1092
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:09,310
unreliable servers a lot that is on the

1093
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:12,069
ships now make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> politically correct I</font>

1094
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:16,140
didn't say windows NT but that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1095
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:16,140
problem we a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago</font>

1096
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:23,950
a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago I think a bunch of</font>

1097
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,990
the captains and admirals got wined and

1098
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:28,240
dined up in redmond and found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1099
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:30,040
this windows NT stuff was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just great and</font>

1100
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:31,899
so they said this is the solution to our

1101
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,020
problem on their minds the problem was

1102
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:36,400
the sailors couldn't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1103
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:38,220
command-line interfaces on the UNIX

1104
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,390
servers and so they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it</font>

1105
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,450
move out the UNIX servers in within

1106
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:45,160
windows NT what they found was after

1107
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:47,620
they had a number of brand new shift

1108
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,930
dead in the water for hours at a time

1109
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,089
because they had to do complete restarts

1110
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:54,310
because of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the unreliability and</font>

1111
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:57,730
you know blue screen of death and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1112
00:44:54,310 --> 00:45:00,310
the other stuff they're learning very

1113
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:02,770
quickly and so actually we're finding a

1114
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:04,600
trend is unix is kind of back in again

1115
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,120
because they want industrial<font color="#E5E5E5"> strength</font>

1116
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:08,620
systems and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux is look at</font>

1117
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,960
the looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> very attractive for a number</font>

1118
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:13,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">of things so it's come full circle so</font>

1119
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,400
that's a real problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the other</font>

1120
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:16,810
concern is the lost management

1121
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,900
capabilities because of the network

1122
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:21,250
hardening as you disable I<font color="#CCCCCC"> cmps because</font>

1123
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:23,320
of you don't want denial of service

1124
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:29,680
attacks now you can't do pains anymore

1125
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:32,950
or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn off source direction and you</font>

1126
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:34,509
can't do the loose source routing or

1127
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:36,370
source routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with trace route anymore</font>

1128
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:37,660
or you turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> off directed broadcast I</font>

1129
00:45:36,370 --> 00:45:39,310
used to be a good tool you just paying

1130
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:40,839
the broadcast address find out if

1131
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,670
anybody's home or what's out there and

1132
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">so forth can't do that anymore as we</font>

1133
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">disabled directed fraud cast and so it'd</font>

1134
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:50,140
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to find some management</font>

1135
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,149
administrative tools which are not

1136
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:54,670
susceptible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those kind of attacks so</font>

1137
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:56,890
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have good tools and then the</font>

1138
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">latest thing is I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just read a report</font>

1139
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:01,450
yesterday that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Clinton is going to</font>

1140
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:05,320
attack Serbia infrastructure by hiring

1141
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:06,549
hackers and seriously this was out on

1142
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the new single it's supposed to</font>

1143
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,390
be a top secret thing to somehow it got

1144
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:13,110
leaked and then it goes side to attack

1145
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:15,819
the banks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Serbia and and steal all</font>

1146
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:18,130
slowdowns money and shut them down and

1147
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,050
so yeah sort of cyber warfare in Reverse

1148
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:23,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're attacking somebody so it will be</font>

1149
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:24,760
interesting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see where that goes that</font>

1150
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,350
was it just sort of wanted to do a

1151
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,780
random walk of some of the things we're

1152
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:31,960
saying from the trend and time for

1153
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:36,400
questions well<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually no we went I</font>

1154
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:37,870
think Mike's dead my god great we went

1155
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,100
way over but since we went way over

1156
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:42,520
might as well continue the trend and

1157
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:44,470
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay quick</font>

1158
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:46,090
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it please introduce yourselves I</font>

1159
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:49,509
mean I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever knows who you are but</font>

1160
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:51,010
still early everyone if you do come for

1161
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:53,530
Mike please introduce yourself just nice

1162
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:55,540
courtesy clean hi I'm Molly Friedman and

1163
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:58,300
we in the back row had an interesting

1164
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:59,620
idea perhaps you'd like to follow what

1165
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,590
some of the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who like to play with</font>

1166
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:06,549
hackers do and set up an ftp<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD mill</font>

1167
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:08,410
that maps to 127 0 dot 0 dot 10 game i

1168
00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,330
know i was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say there are</font>

1169
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:11,859
some providers that will filter give you

1170
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:14,170
IP space that you can filter<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your</font>

1171
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:15,010
border but that does break you know then

1172
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:16,600
you'd be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do diagnostics</font>

1173
00:47:15,010 --> 00:47:19,240
internally but not necessarily

1174
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,040
externally and one other thing we are

1175
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,169
listening to a talk about security and

1176
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:24,640
the five people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have their laptops</font>

1177
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:27,340
completely open to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole network</font>

1178
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,529
should probably turn off any microsoft

1179
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:34,930
thing that they're running this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

1180
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:38,020
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay out in the back I'm Jan Jan</font>

1181
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:40,089
of cable artists and I really welcome

1182
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:43,060
what do you whistle there your

1183
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:45,550
requirements from the ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace and we</font>

1184
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:49,660
have most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have there</font>

1185
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:55,920
and let me just<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain that though we</font>

1186
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:59,980
do have a you can't reach our humans

1187
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:03,730
voices with 800<font color="#E5E5E5"> members but we do like</font>

1188
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:07,270
you to allow the web-based ticketing

1189
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:10,810
system so that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance report so</font>

1190
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:12,790
that it gets into our system and unless

1191
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:16,950
you really have problem of doing that

1192
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:19,810
and we do take<font color="#E5E5E5"> down by the phone and we</font>

1193
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:22,689
operate as well put in the your your

1194
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:26,370
report into the fitting system so

1195
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:28,420
everything will get tracked on track<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1196
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:31,870
the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said about the</font>

1197
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:34,900
response time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're you first get</font>

1198
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:36,609
the automated response and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

1199
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:37,940
mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not working at wait</font>

1200
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:41,910
we're working on that

1201
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:45,740
but anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we do need our customers</font>

1202
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:49,680
surely this early phases our customers

1203
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:51,959
using our the address space during an

1204
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,529
attack we need to get a response<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1205
00:48:51,960 --> 00:49:01,079
our customers before we can respond to

1206
00:48:55,529 --> 00:49:04,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and your customers are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not educated</font>

1207
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:09,299
as well educated<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Russell Group as</font>

1208
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:12,690
ours for you and that takes time<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1209
00:49:09,299 --> 00:49:15,750
yeah okay okay for more question over

1210
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:17,910
here hi I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bill Woodcock an issue</font>

1211
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:21,119
that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up in conversation a</font>

1212
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:25,140
lot with the certs our customer sites

1213
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,520
that I'd like your take on is as they

1214
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:30,390
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and more into using</font>

1215
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:33,779
VPNs there's always the tendency to

1216
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:36,390
think of the VPN or a firewall or

1217
00:49:33,779 --> 00:49:39,140
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> as being this sort of very</font>

1218
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:41,490
secure boundary around their network and

1219
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:43,500
negating the need for host security

1220
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:47,308
within that boundary the problem with

1221
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:49,619
VPNs obviously is that you lose the

1222
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:51,569
ability to define a physical perimeter

1223
00:49:49,619 --> 00:49:52,890
and suddenly you've got things that

1224
00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:57,270
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> treating a secure which you have</font>

1225
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:59,490
no physical security at no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea where</font>

1226
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:00,960
they might be physically no idea what

1227
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:06,270
else might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be connected to the networks</font>

1228
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:08,430
how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you doing with that a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1229
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:11,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came to mind we do see that</font>

1230
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:13,470
trend a lot where if the host operators

1231
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,609
think there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good strong perimeter</font>

1232
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,709
defense that they don't need any

1233
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:19,740
additional perfect defense that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1234
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">very serious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem on the DoD's secret</font>

1236
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:25,259
everybody who could hook up a computer

1237
00:50:23,579 --> 00:50:26,730
things well it's totally disconnected

1238
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:28,410
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything on the outside world I</font>

1240
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:33,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">it the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the community of cipro</font>

1241
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:35,940
net is about 500,000 users so the term

1242
00:50:33,299 --> 00:50:38,400
you hear going<font color="#E5E5E5"> around is I'm shared</font>

1243
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:41,400
secrets with 500,000 of my closest

1244
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,440
friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so it's not very secure in</font>

1245
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:45,750
that sense and they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a</font>

1246
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,579
bunch of security as far as the VPN

1247
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:49,109
issue one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are doing</font>

1248
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:50,440
there is make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever we</font>

1249
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:53,290
bring

1250
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,819
VPN connection in at the connection

1251
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:56,680
point we're installing intrusion

1252
00:50:54,819 --> 00:50:58,329
detection systems to make sure that we

1253
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:00,759
don't lose that because of course over

1254
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:02,349
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN is typically encrypted and we're</font>

1255
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:06,250
trying very hard to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure all the</font>

1256
00:51:02,349 --> 00:51:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">back doors are shut down internally so</font>

1257
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:11,230
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another pads in so hopefully</font>

1258
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:14,500
that answers some of the questions one

1259
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:16,480
more my name is Chris Caputo<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you</font>

1260
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:19,650
guys looked at using tools like<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

1261
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,480
flight recorder or other intrusion tools

1262
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:25,240
yeah we've used almost all of them up

1263
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we played with in a bar and and in</font>

1264
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,069
a lack of security tools for ATM there's

1265
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">a couple of companies that actually make</font>

ATM cards that you can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a pcs and</font>

1267
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:37,540
use something like mint real network but

add new network devices to them easily
