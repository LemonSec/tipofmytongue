1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
sorry oh hi my name is Alan Hannon I'm

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,040
the director of network architecture at

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,480
frontier global<font color="#CCCCCC"> Center</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and just what</font>

4
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:12,660
we wanted to do was to kind of give a

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,360
case study not so much like a background

6
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,759
information or not so much what Sprint's

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,800
doin but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a case study of what</font>

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,230
what a<font color="#CCCCCC"> green field network is and and</font>

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,029
some of the trials and tribulations you

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,470
go through I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really like the term</font>

11
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">Greenfield network but it seemed to come</font>

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mind and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> letters come to me and they</font>

13
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:31,920
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell it stopped amazed they</font>

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,030
always say we're a Greenfeld network and

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,420
I guess you would kind of put people

16
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,210
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Enron Williams level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three quest</font>

17
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,320
and frontier as kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Greenfield</font>

18
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:41,640
network because we're kind of starting

19
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,530
from the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you have a</font>

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">Greenfield mania you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start from</font>

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,739
there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subtitled how to go from</font>

22
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,090
five word mpls in one year now in theory

23
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,660
this is going to be online but I broke

24
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">it okay so here's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda I wanna do</font>

25
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,660
is just run through some stuff and I'm

26
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,600
pretty interactive and I know it's kind

27
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,980
of awkward to you know to like ask

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,680
questions in the middle but please feel

29
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,780
free and i'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run through this in</font>

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,869
just a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and then maybe we'll</font>

31
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,330
grab all the positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls people back</font>

32
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,010
up but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more so we're</font>

33
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through here just how we started</font>

34
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,070
off some of the decisions we made some

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,679
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges we had how we're doing</font>

36
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,389
things now and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> snapshot of where</font>

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,119
we're at and again the message here is

38
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,950
you hear a lot about new isp starting up

39
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,720
you hear about all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people with all</font>

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,220
this fiber and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a case</font>

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,840
study of what we went through starting

42
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,369
from the beginning getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to where we</font>

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,390
are now which we're pretty proud<font color="#CCCCCC"> of in</font>

44
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">our network is not 16 the site of spring</font>

45
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so in the beginning I actually</font>

46
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,100
joined about a year and a half ago and

47
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,539
there were four companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> IFI prime net</font>

48
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">Voyager and frontier net they were</font>

49
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,740
separate networks and when the big task

50
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,270
we had was putting them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all together we</font>

51
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,860
had new bosses from frontier and

52
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,179
learning how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work with them wasn't</font>

53
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,220
that difficult but it was certainly part

54
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,770
of the overall challenge so we had

55
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:59,130
emerged das is trans

56
00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:00,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">igp from ospf to is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is built the team up</font>

57
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,449
to where we have a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong team now</font>

58
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:04,940
and plan the new network building and

59
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was a real challenge as well</font>

60
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,539
because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got bought by a bunch of</font>

61
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,870
telescope people and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> peter knows</font>

62
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,519
telco people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 people right so so</font>

63
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,290
we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince them that ATM wasn't</font>

64
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,210
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way the truth and the</font>

65
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,890
life<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's oh we should've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

66
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,350
pretty good job at that but there was a

67
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,179
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of religion and at one point our CEO</font>

68
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Joe Clayton I remember the quote he said</font>

69
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,210
god<font color="#CCCCCC"> damn it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bill both so we just built</font>

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,690
one IT / w vm network and we built one

71
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,220
ATM over<font color="#E5E5E5"> WDM network and that way we</font>

72
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,260
feel that that was a real good decision

73
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">for us because we were able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

74
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:43,530
both of those as purely as possible so

75
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:45,810
we built that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and one of the one of</font>

76
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sticking points we made was that we</font>

77
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,790
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a pure IP / WDM network</font>

78
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,460
because we felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by the time we</font>

79
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,200
needed to constrain bandwidth of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

80
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,030
network we would have technology

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,859
available to do mpls something that

82
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,239
Peter was ribbing me about a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

83
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">so hopefully I'll prove the point that</font>

84
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,300
mpls is a useful thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

85
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,220
started off<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

86
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,410
apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had this all set up for 1024</font>

87
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,570
x 768 it look pretty neat but now you

88
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:14,670
can just kind of barely see it run to

89
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">your hired quest to build about 17,000</font>

90
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,470
route miles fiber we then went out and

91
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,450
swapped out about another 4,000 to wear

92
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,120
today we have about 21,000 route miles

93
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:27,089
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over there each one of those black</font>

95
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,610
24 strands of fiber and I believe that's

96
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,090
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> loosened true wave or whatever</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">corning's equivalent is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that so we</font>

98
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,620
said we got this fiber out here and

99
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:42,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">instead think Dave Segal and I were kind</font>

100
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,980
of the folks at<font color="#E5E5E5"> wayne and john wall</font>

101
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,000
there we<font color="#E5E5E5"> hadn't bought everyone on board</font>

102
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,859
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to make this</font>

103
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff happen and you know you start off</font>

104
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,560
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an ingredient just like</font>

105
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,120
Peter was showing all the buzz words you

106
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,760
have and you say how you make the best

107
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,070
network out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it well one of the things</font>

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,899
we had at this time was a really good

109
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:02,040
transmission group and the transmission

110
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,170
group had built out a WDM system using

111
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,540
NEC

112
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:10,099
which could use 16 lambdas and they made

113
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:14,120
the decision to use back in 1997 early

114
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:16,250
98 to use NEC at OC 48 and some of our

115
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,769
competitors like quest and some others

116
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,570
chose to use OC 192 and we kind of poke

117
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,400
fun at them because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they went out and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

118
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,139
out these big OC 19<font color="#E5E5E5"> u2's which took up</font>

119
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,239
half the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rack space and then they had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

120
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,000
buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> these big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ATMs that went from OC 192</font>

121
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,220
back down to OC 48 to make it useful but

122
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,900
we start off with OC 48 you know I think

123
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've been inundated with WDM and last</font>

124
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple hours but the main thing is that</font>

125
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,750
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can pull out lambdas or individual</font>

126
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,940
colors and you can actually plug those

127
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,100
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment so that's what our focus</font>

128
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,810
was plug them into Titan<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lux's plug them</font>

129
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,650
into the ATM switches and plug them into

130
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:50,900
the routers so we need a home and we say

131
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what a hub looks like basically</font>

132
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:55,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">we wanted to build a hierarchy in and</font>

133
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:56,990
make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really robust so we said let's</font>

134
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:58,850
build things in pairs because<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Peter</font>

135
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,830
was alluding to earlier the routers you

136
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:01,760
know are not absolutely stable so we

137
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,070
wanted to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a network</font>

138
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,450
that could sustain a backbone failure

139
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,130
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the overall network health would</font>

140
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,469
remain and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> job</font>

141
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:13,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what we have is a woman called</font>

142
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,530
a lan router a WR in pairs we call a CR

143
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,390
a core router and then what we call

144
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:18,919
component routers here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom so</font>

145
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,260
each rather the bottom has a certain

146
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:23,750
role it might be focused on aggregating

147
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:27,260
dedicated customer or on peering or on

148
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:29,870
anything else like that so it's capable

149
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:33,229
OC 48 at the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 02 12 down the middle</font>

150
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,880
layer and OC 3 at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom layer what</font>

151
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,200
we found is that we're at the edge of

152
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,419
that scaling we actually have to start

153
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,830
going OC 12 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your hierarchy</font>

154
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:43,490
starts breaking apart which is a

155
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:47,150
challenge right now and we built a

156
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,820
network design which basically has 30

157
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,560
c48 rings one of them here in San

158
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,570
Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> Los Angeles Kansas City in</font>

159
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Houston another one with in Kansas City</font>

160
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,590
Cleveland Atlanta Houston and finally a

161
00:05:56,150 --> 00:06:00,799
triangle between cleveland New York and

162
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,989
DC the blue<font color="#CCCCCC"> is OC 4088</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Reds OC 12</font>

163
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,580
green<font color="#CCCCCC"> and OC 3 there's some interesting</font>

164
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,830
challenges you have here for example

165
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,510
people laugh what's so great about

166
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,030
Cleveland in Kansas City<font color="#E5E5E5"> why would you</font>

167
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:11,990
choose to put big circuits there and you

168
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,059
know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a whole</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

169
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,889
technology business and Cleveland but

170
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,599
what we found

171
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:18,669
with it at the point in the build out

172
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,069
where we were Chicago was effectively a

173
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,400
stuff so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run an OC 48 to</font>

174
00:06:21,069 --> 00:06:31,419
Chicago we have to do from the backbone

175
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:32,679
let's see here no way there we go we

176
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:34,719
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to have gone from the</font>

177
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,419
backbone up to Chicago and back down

178
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:38,498
there eating two units of fiber there so

179
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,240
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you wonder why people</font>

180
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:45,840
build networks certain way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

181
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:48,159
help explain some of the issues alrighty

182
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,128
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the network looks now</font>

183
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:54,009
and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the super granular picture</font>

184
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:55,930
but right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have an OC 48 ring up</font>

185
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:58,689
between San Francisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> Los Angeles and</font>

186
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:00,250
Kansas City that kansas city of la

187
00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:02,169
circuit actually runs through<font color="#E5E5E5"> houston</font>

188
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:05,169
but our<font color="#CCCCCC"> houston hub isn't completed yet</font>

189
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:07,479
so it's concatenated there we didn't

190
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:09,609
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ot 48 cross country from San</font>

191
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,139
Francisco to Kansas<font color="#E5E5E5"> City</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Cleveland to</font>

192
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:13,389
New York this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the new york metro area</font>

193
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:17,020
and then OC 12 ring on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> east coast</font>

194
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,210
and OC 12 back on the west coast one of

195
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,789
the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that points out here is that</font>

196
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,859
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually IP / w DM so what you</font>

197
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,810
see right now is a single path the

198
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,729
initial build is the single path

199
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,800
starting a third quarter we do the

200
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:32,050
second build there's some of what he was

201
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,719
talking about what you might have the

202
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">West router coming into your first WR in</font>

203
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:38,169
the east I'm sorry the<font color="#E5E5E5"> west circuit</font>

204
00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,758
coming in your first of you are and the

205
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:41,758
<font color="#CCCCCC">east serve it going in your second WR</font>

206
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:46,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so i talked about how she called</font>

207
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:48,520
us off the main route you know

208
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:50,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">year-and-a-half Costa 48 was a really</font>

209
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,549
neat thing it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new and you</font>

210
00:07:50,529 --> 00:07:53,620
know you weren't sure when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor is</font>

211
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,289
going to hit the timeline but really

212
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,270
being bleeding edge there we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

213
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:00,068
of risk we had to take when he finally

214
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:01,899
got the stuff from from the vendors we

215
00:08:00,069 --> 00:08:04,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">tested it out and it was really</font>

216
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:06,339
anticlimactic is stuff just worked we

217
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:08,620
got it from we use cisco and juniper and

218
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:11,379
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just work just fine so we're</font>

219
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:12,550
real happy with that no sonnet optics

220
00:08:11,379 --> 00:08:14,349
problems are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we were real</font>

221
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:17,289
worried about signal loss and framing

222
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:20,469
and things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it worked the</font>

223
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:21,590
real challenge here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started off at mid</font>

224
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:23,900
net back in 94

225
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,520
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an NSF met and to me internet</font>

226
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,530
was like a video game you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just would log</font>

227
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,849
into routers and configure stuff and it

228
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">was neat I never really had to worry</font>

229
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:34,610
about physical issues but when you do a

230
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,780
large-scale deployment and they'll be

231
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,980
wrong about three months after eyes

232
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead Neela physical issues but</font>

233
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,930
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing to me how how significant</font>

234
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,030
that physical issues are for building

235
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:46,520
out a large network finding space

236
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,470
getting power getting your cabling and

237
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:53,120
fiber things set up so that they work

238
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:54,620
it's really really tricky so we also

239
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,300
were concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the diameter of the</font>

240
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,890
network and I sent a note off about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

241
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">year ago maybe nine months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago about how</font>

242
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,640
packet or sonic could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

243
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,870
because if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to embrace packet</font>

244
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,199
over sonet they're going to add more IP

245
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">hops</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I got about seven responses</font>

246
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,170
may all said I was silly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean said</font>

247
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,320
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean door and said something other</font>

248
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:14,270
than that but this actually became a

249
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,550
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to go in so</font>

250
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,250
far as customers that use windows 95

251
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:20,660
have a default ppl 32 and at certain

252
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,660
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> our network the diameter was</font>

253
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,400
about 17 so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking that up you</font>

254
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,730
know 17 30 seconds it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more than</font>

255
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">half it really limited the size of</font>

256
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,800
networks they could see the size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

257
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,090
internet they could see we also

258
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,370
interconnect IP an ATM at 12 locations

259
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:38,900
so we have circuits<font color="#CCCCCC"> so customers that</font>

260
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,500
want to choose a DM can actually hop

261
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,670
onto the IP network and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ApS</font>

262
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,380
restore time maybe we can talk about

263
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in the panel afterwards if I'm sure</font>

264
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,860
Peter and I have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

265
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,880
the focus here for us i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

266
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,500
picture coming up soon well close um you

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,730
know let's focus on using mpls to do

268
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,910
factory wrap we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that a</font>

269
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:01,040
second so as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as deployment issues we</font>

270
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,420
respect out<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 10 racks for the major</font>

271
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,650
hub because we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build in for</font>

272
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,630
growth<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was really frustrating</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting</font>

273
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,660
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those to get bills and the stuff</font>

274
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,790
moved around to have that the site text

275
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,680
you know

276
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm recruiting real heavily here because

277
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,319
we want a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of smart people it's hard</font>

278
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find smart people at this at this</font>

279
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,340
level but it's also real hard to find

280
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,440
smart people at the sonnet level people

281
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:23,710

282
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:25,090
test and took like that being in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> COS</font>

283
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,410
we weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on site of career kind</font>

284
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:29,140
of guessed that was interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

285
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,819
the DC power plant built out and even

286
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,260
things as small as getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber from</font>

287
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,520
that corner of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> co2 this one just</font>

288
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,930
just learning how to work all that which

289
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:40,030
different from the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I grew</font>

290
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:43,060
up with already so remember a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

291
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:45,760
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the assumption</font>

292
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,979
that mpls would be available<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us by</font>

293
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:54,340
the time we needed it and what we found

294
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:58,750
is that was just we just made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so see</font>

295
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:00,130
here today in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and this has</font>

296
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,740
been fairly concert for last six months

297
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:05,650
we have about 250 routers of those

298
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,970
routers about 175 run is is and bgp so

299
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,579
there you know real routers the other

300
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,140
ones kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome side not a thousand</font>

301
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:15,880
backbone links in the network including

302
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,530
the the landlink local and about 20

303
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,180
major hubs so this was kind of our

304
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,670
target we wanted to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pick a point</font>

305
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,010
it was about second quarter year two

306
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,719
thousand and a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of traffic</font>

307
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,090
and a certain network topology and that

308
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,210
was kind of our target design point so

309
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:33,400
we said we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and half sleeves</font>

310
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:34,900
of traffic going out of the network we

311
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,370
got about eggs egg yolks appearing

312
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,040
capacity we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build the</font>

313
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,690
backbone out at OC 48 how do we take the

314
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,300
traffic that's offered<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the network</font>

315
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">and often we fit it to the the capacity</font>

316
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,530
that we have now lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berg's on would</font>

317
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:48,760
say put more circuit then but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live in</font>

318
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:51,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">the real world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of difficult</font>

319
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,990
so you want to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you better</font>

320
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,490
crack you find you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get ahead but</font>

321
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,720
sometimes if you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it here you</font>

322
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,510
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it elsewhere you really want to</font>

323
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:03,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">take advantage of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so this is the</font>

324
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:06,100
another vision test this is the ideal

325
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,640
network topology oh wow we move that

326
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,640
down with it

327
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:14,290
maybe not oh well oh so the idea here is

328
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,490
that in a given geographic region<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd</font>

329
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a certain number of cities where</font>

330
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,530
you want to interconnect you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

331
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,089
different customer demand in each city

332
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,010
but ideally you're going to have red and

333
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:25,150
green cities and in certain metropolitan

334
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,819
areas you're going to have a moderate

335
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,439
amount of capacity between each city so

336
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:31,360
you know if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> United States</font>

337
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,640
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a DC area and this is New</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> York</font>

338
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,020
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Seattle the Bay Area you're</font>

339
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,420
probably not too concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

340
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:39,310
Kansas<font color="#CCCCCC"> City area this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

341
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:40,990
looking at and what you want to do then

342
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">is divided them into geographic regions</font>

343
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,130
and designate certain cities of transit

344
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,410
cities and leave other cities like the

345
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:48,820
green ones as metropolitan cities so

346
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,860
that if one of the red hubs were to

347
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,300
break there would still be another hub

348
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,870
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Metropolitan ring to carry the</font>

349
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:58,240
traffic out so in a traditional IP

350
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,300
network if you want to go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> A to B or</font>

351
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,860
B to a if it actually reveals itself you

352
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,140
make a hop by hop routing decision which

353
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone's real familiar with what we'd</font>

354
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:11,110
like to do instead however is use mpls

355
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:14,260
to create regional tabs and transit

356
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,010
paths of how traffic will flow on

357
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,810
certain certain repairs<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in addition</font>

358
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:22,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to construct</font>

359
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:24,489
a backup LSP path such that if the head

360
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,620
end of the LSP recognizes there's a

361
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,580
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll fall over to the backup</font>

362
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,380
one this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just another view of the</font>

363
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,670
network topology and if you put these

364
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:37,230
things on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other you can</font>

365
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine it's scaling very very high</font>

366
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:47,530
so I really have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> embrace the</font>

367
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:49,540
hierarchy a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people don't get that</font>

368
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,959
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call the</font>

369
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,550
problem but our target again looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

370
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,950
like second quarter<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 what we want to</font>

371
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">design for is about 300 routers so if</font>

372
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,010
you take 300 routers and you assume a

373
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,400
uniform distribution you'll end up with

374
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:05,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 30 in each of your ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nine or ten</font>

geographic regions if he doesn't need

376
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,910
each router it's either being in the

377
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,740
transit backbone or in a regional area

378
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,600
you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with about 30 routers for</font>

379
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:15,670
region and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at unique router</font>

380
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,960
pairs you're going to have about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 900 so</font>

381
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,250
what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do here scope our</font>

382
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,350
problems so that we have something we

383
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:22,150
can manage a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people will say it</font>

384
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:24,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't make sense</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do our FCP in the</font>

385
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,990
network because a single router campus

386
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:28,210
can't manage 10,000 flows and that's

387
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:30,280
absolutely right but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you segment your</font>

388
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,260
network hierarchically you generally can

389
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:35,110
do a lot more things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you</font>

390
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,450
have 30 router if you have 900 LSPs and

391
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,790
if you have maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 LSPs / router</font>

392
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:42,040
because maybe you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different VPNs</font>

393
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:45,490
maybe have classes a service maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">10 so you go to 9000 and in each of the</font>

396
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,280
regions you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might have 9,000 so there's</font>

397
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:55,660
90,000 so a lot of folks have systems

398
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,800
engineering background you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

399
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,910
you probably can manage within the

400
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,170
domain about 9,000 if you do some some

401
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,420
complex math problems I don't really

402
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:06,610
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each router</font>

403
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,719
at most is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have about 9,000 LSP</font>

404
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:09,130
is going through it but much more

405
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:14,550
realistically on the order of five

406
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,550
hundred to a thousand okay

407
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:20,790
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do then in our network is</font>

408
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:24,000
you then build a mess on the backbone

409
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,380
such that each transit node has a full

410
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,840
message of connectivity to each other

411
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,310
transit note on the backbone and then

412
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:34,020
also in each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the region's you</font>

413
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:36,569
build a match so this gives you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

414
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:38,760
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> neat stuff this gives you a let</font>

415
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,620
me read fine-grained control of a router

416
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,910
pair traffic flows so one of the

417
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,880
problems we used to run into is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

418
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:47,160
when we're managing our ITP metrics if i

419
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,450
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place to</font>

420
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:50,459
that place and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I changed something in</font>

421
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,050
the middle I'm unlikely to affect more

422
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,460
things than just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that router pair I'm</font>

423
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,829
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to affect other things going</font>

424
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">through there as well but with mpls LSPs</font>

425
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,820
you're actually able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take just that</font>

426
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Robert pair and change it it also gives</font>

427
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">you a constraint based routing system I</font>

428
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">think someone was joking earlier you</font>

429
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:07,979
have to have two hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers to</font>

430
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,150
traffic engineer your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

431
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,270
sure we understand we're trying to do

432
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:14,069
here we're not trying to have every day

433
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,170
a person come in and configure an LSP

434
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:17,490
and tell it to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way you want to</font>

435
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">build this into the system so it knows</font>

436
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">how many resources it needs and it then</font>

437
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,060
asked for those from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and</font>

438
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's automated one of the tricks here</font>

439
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,930
though and hopefully something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

440
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,030
have more talks on in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future if had</font>

441
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,099
you actually build a system like that do

442
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,660
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do an online or offline and what</font>

443
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of periodicity do you give to the</font>

444
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:38,670
off to the optimization the other thing

445
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,100
that gives you this real life is really

446
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:43,439
fine grain traffic statistics a lot of

447
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:44,580
folks have experience with net flow but

448
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the neat things about this is you</font>

449
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,400
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how much traffic goes from</font>

450
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,590
router a<font color="#CCCCCC"> to router be because you have</font>

451
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,590
an LSP going there and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually</font>

452
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">major that traffic it also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you the</font>

453
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,920
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do layer three hot masking</font>

454
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:57,300
and I suppose you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leave a</font>

455
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,740
marketing bastard because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

456
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,469
show a few hops but that's not really

457
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the reason for it the reason is that</font>

458
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:05,610
somebody once decided that windows 95

459
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,359
only need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 32 and it caused a lot of</font>

460
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:11,429
painful<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really the</font>

461
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,839
neat thing is that mpls provides a

462
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,780
framework for just all kinds of nifty

463
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,800
things I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of</font>

464
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:19,710
paradigm shift to make the whole

465
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,849
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to grow and I think</font>

466
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

467
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:28,580
ok so we're winding up here so we

468
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,639
started testing about two and a half

469
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:33,110
months ago it<font color="#E5E5E5"> went pretty well we</font>

470
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:34,729
deployed code out in the network about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

471
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:37,039
month and a half ago with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco's and</font>

472
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,720
junipers production implementation it

473
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:42,289
was about three weeks ago kind of a

474
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,840
ramp-up period today we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code</font>

475
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:46,460
running on about 145 routers we've got

476
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,149
that land mesh that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was showing you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

477
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:52,399
the backbone between seven hubs yeah and

478
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:53,539
then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten cities so three more</font>

479
00:17:52,399 --> 00:17:55,129
than that seven but actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have all</font>

480
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,129
the routers in the hub mesh together and

481
00:17:55,129 --> 00:18:02,090
then when I when I counted there were

482
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:05,500
250 LSPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> production in the new york</font>

483
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:09,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">city area we have about five or six</font>

484
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,730
physical hubs or physical tops and about

485
00:18:09,139 --> 00:18:12,379
half of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is meshed together so we're</font>

486
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,500
definitely in a state of transition

487
00:18:12,379 --> 00:18:17,750
towards this but the busiest LSPs do

488
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,639
about a hundred eggs the one the one

489
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:22,850
that's there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually up at ameritech</font>

490
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:25,668
ADF that's the only place we're doing in

491
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:27,080
pls that significant hearing one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

492
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:29,480
that I found really interesting and it's

493
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,980
not too terribly surprising was that you

494
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,980
have certain traffic flows on your cross

495
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,799
country backbone be on the order of 5<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

496
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,299
600 megs on a circuit that's a lot of

497
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,309
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> but when you take that and you</font>

498
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually start d aggregating that on it</font>

499
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:44,059
particular router pairs it goes down

500
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:45,500
quite a bit you know if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

501
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:47,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">the N squared second how many routers</font>

502
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,679
you have it breaks down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's</font>

503
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:53,210
like 5 10 13 eggs on each LSP and we

504
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,950
think it's pretty reasonable this has

505
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,899
been our goal for a long time is at the

506
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning of 2nd quarter 99 to do all of</font>

507
00:18:56,899 --> 00:19:00,649
our traffic engineering and have mpls

508
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:04,460
fully deployed in our backbone and we

509
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:06,529
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to hit that all right</font>

510
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,820
so we're almost done here<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks to a</font>

511
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:11,169
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people which will be up on a</font>

512
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:11,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">webpage later and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

513
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,539
summary it was a great opportunity you

514
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,980
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that I'm presenting this</font>

515
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:20,389
more from a case study to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look what we</font>

516
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,340
did because this isn't what we did this

517
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:23,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it sounds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really cheesy but I</font>

518
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,428
mean this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this all our</font>

519
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:27,469
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Cisco engineers it's</font>

520
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:28,320
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Peter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn all</font>

521
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,029
kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font>

522
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,490
really contributed to for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time I</font>

523
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:34,049
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> think mpls the strategic key</font>

524
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,870
technologies and I think Peter you need

525
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,850
to wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you have</font>

526
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:40,229
comments you can mail it there and we're

527
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">really trying to hire a lot of people so</font>

528
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is shameless that we're having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

529
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:48,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of beer up here tonight imma throw</font>

530
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:49,350
40 so all I not do my questions but if

531
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:51,809
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone up here I think</font>

532
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've got enough time to Peter do you</font>

533
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:59,120
want to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here and we'll have both</font>

534
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:59,120
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wrestle no no no none of that</font>

535
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:10,590
yeah so first we need questions from the

536
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:13,379
audience mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we can you can get</font>

537
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,600
them up to let's see what question

538
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:18,059
business first a question for Peter I

539
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,889
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously the introduction of pcs</font>

540
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,080
phones has degraded many of our

541
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:24,389
expectations but how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you arrive at</font>

542
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:32,210
point three seconds as your target

543
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:38,309
therefore 2002 Oh microphone technology

544
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:40,769
I let them talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people that work with</font>

545
00:20:38,309 --> 00:20:43,470
you and beings and ask them how slow how

546
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:45,269
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interruptions I need for people</font>

547
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:49,679
to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it isn't into</font>

548
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:52,409
interruption and the human body isn't

549
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,990
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that range so I said people can</font>

550
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:56,639
trick if people can't see it I mean the

551
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,440
critical applications are not sending

552
00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:00,649
emails or moving large claws the

553
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:03,720
critical applications are watching TV

554
00:21:00,649 --> 00:21:05,699
talking to people we're at endpoint is a

555
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,200
human being and if we if it's so fast

556
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,259
that the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> being can know is it it's</font>

557
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,250
good enough that doesn't seem like the

558
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:14,580
target you're hitting and you think

559
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:17,610
about 33 frames per second in a typical

560
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:21,178
movie stream for example if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

know I the stuff we're trying to do is

do have them but we have to the other

00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,179
primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad the way this stuff work is</font>

632
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,830
with constraint based routing and today

633
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:26,750
what we have running in the network is

634
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,178
the ability to set bandwidth on each one

635
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:31,280
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the LSPs and also set bandwidth on</font>

636
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:34,700
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the physical links such that</font>

637
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,860
when when an LSP is created it goes from

638
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,110
the head in throughout the network using

639
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,449
RSVP as a set of protocol to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

640
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:44,389
destination and it creates the primary

641
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,190
path now a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple algorithm for</font>

642
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,380
building

643
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:50,260
back up half and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> head end goes</font>

644
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:52,450
out and creates an LSP but keeps a

645
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:54,010
record of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routers and all of the</font>

646
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,470
links that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it traversed on the primary</font>

647
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">path and does not reverse any of those</font>

648
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,790
such that the backup pass is totally

649
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,889
autonomous<font color="#E5E5E5"> the primary path and all of</font>

650
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:05,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a protocol spec issue</font>

651
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,690
it's an implementation issue and how you

652
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,740
create your LSP is on the head in one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

653
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,720
the problems here though is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

654
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,510
want to double allocate resources so you

655
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,210
have to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to active to reserve</font>

656
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:20,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the backup path and it's what</font>

657
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:22,360
that's worth tricky actually I have a

658
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">question you mentioned that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

659
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,840
two methods to actually configuring

660
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,580
these either static offline or some type

661
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:32,110
of dynamic what are you actually doing

662
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:35,080
today to configure the LSP s popular

663
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,580
dynamic so you configure it I mean it's

664
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,639
pretty simple in both the vendors you

665
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:41,530
can figure in LSP with a destination and

666
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,390
a bandwidth and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much all</font>

667
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:44,920
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need and then it goes out maps for</font>

668
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,170
the bandwidth from each interface with

669
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:49,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">RSVP and again we're not talking about</font>

670
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,520
RSVP here for you all to use on net

671
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:55,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting or anything like that it it's</font>

672
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:58,270
RSVP used as a signaling protocol for

673
00:25:55,090 --> 00:26:00,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> background</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in CLS so actually what</font>

674
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:02,650
you can do is set up set up hierarchies

675
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,450
such that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary one might be an</font>

676
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:06,400
explicitly<font color="#CCCCCC"> rooted pasture so long as a</font>

677
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:09,820
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> manner and then the secondary</font>

678
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:11,500
path could be just<font color="#CCCCCC"> constraint-based</font>

679
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:14,110
especially we try to find its own way

680
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if that find its own way path breaks</font>

681
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:21,850
it goes and finds its<font color="#E5E5E5"> own way another</font>

682
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:23,709
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was wondering if you</font>

683
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:27,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">had a multicast architecture in mind</font>

684
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:28,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Frager MPLS network or if that is going</font>

685
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,809
to be separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the info</font>

686
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,690
network do we have mpls in mind shirt

687
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:36,250
now you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a multicast architecture we</font>

688
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,230
have multicast in mind for the network

689
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,240
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that any of the</font>

690
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:44,380
design decisions we made with mpls were

691
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,900
were severely severely impacted by a

692
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,520
desire to do multicast moving moving

693
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,780
package from point A to point B or

694
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,129
moving packets whether you choose to

695
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:54,730
replicate them is somewhere along the

696
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:57,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle so the MPLS is an overlay</font>

697
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,570
forwarding system the thing is one of

698
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,740
the tricks though is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really a</font>

699
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,908
forwarding system it's just like a

700
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:05,500
vector system sometimes the answer is

701
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:07,030

707
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:25,120
you talked about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> EPS but I don't we</font>

708
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:27,610

said<font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes less time then takes less</font>

710
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:35,760

714
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:46,990
biased question but a question for Peter

715
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,610
you said when you're talking about

716
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,830
multicast that you would only deploy a

717
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,959
standards-based technology so I'm

718
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:56,580
wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you're using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> srp your</font>

719
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,200
network are talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> using SRP I</font>

720
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,158
said to satisfy space technology for

721
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,140
multicast how I indicate that is totally

722
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:07,510
visible to the routing protocols because

723
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">SRP from a multicast routing protocol</font>

724
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:13,860
looks like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet work or was that</font>

725
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">a question</font>
