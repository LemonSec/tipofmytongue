<font color="#E5E5E5">okay good well this is going to be a</font>

00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:09,030
much shorter report and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn's</font>

00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,750
presentation as many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may know the</font>

00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:17,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF formed a working group to look into</font>

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:21,830
watch UK implications as far as the IEPs

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,930
protocols are concerned so I was the

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:26,459
working group editor on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the documents</font>

8
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">and ended up writing most of it and</font>

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,529
doing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the research so this is</font>

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:39,899
just a short<font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation on what we</font>

11
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:41,940
came up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with well the goals of the</font>

12
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,129
project were to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at internet</font>

13
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,120
protocols and we specifically limited

14
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:51,239
those to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols documented in the</font>

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,730
RFC series<font color="#CCCCCC"> there obviously there are a</font>

16
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,519
lot of protocols that have grown<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,358
outside the RFC series and we left those

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:05,339
to their original designers to make some

19
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:09,049
statement about we finished our

20
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,970
preliminary work last summer and the

21
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,270
documents has actually been approved for

22
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,509
publication of RFC and is just awaiting

23
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:21,420
me to fix the several hundred pages of

24
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:25,650
margin errors that have occurred in it

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">before it's published some years ago the</font>

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,939
RFC editor changed their rules to as to

27
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,700
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> columns of text could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

28
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,369
page so all of the references to the old

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:37,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">rfcs that didn't have that requirement</font>

30
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:42,960
in it are now<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaking all of the</font>

31
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:44,040
current requirements so we formed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,380
working group in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> summer of</font>

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,899
ninety-six and we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would be</font>

34
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,240
easy hey we had all the people inside

35
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,180
the IETF who had<font color="#E5E5E5"> written protocols</font>

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,689
originally so we could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap on their</font>

37
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,750
shoulders and hopefully get answers

38
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,449
pretty quickly and then our goal

39
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously was to communicate this</font>

40
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,619
information as widely as possible

41
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,300
now the concepts are well understood

42
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:16,879
it's not rocket science regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:19,700
what some of the pundits may try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and let</font>

44
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,000
us know the biggest problem we had was

45
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,310
lack of interest no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> cared none of</font>

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,050
the researchers people want to go write

47
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:30,230
new protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to design you</font>

48
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:35,209
thing I don't want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the RFC</font>

49
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:37,700
I wrote eight years ago so it had a lot

50
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:42,110
of problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that just for your</font>

51
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:44,268
<font color="#CCCCCC">information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the URL of that's</font>

52
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,880
great do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> implements a faculty</font>

53
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,560
magically appears there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the URL for</font>

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the current draft which is the one that</font>

55
00:02:48,560 --> 00:03:00,200
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be published and my email address</font>

56
00:02:50,690 --> 00:03:03,680
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions so what we did</font>

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,950
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we broke up all the rfcs into 16</font>

58
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
categories would be hope and desire to

59
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving sort of an expert or two in each</font>

60
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,230
general category to go over the rfcs

61
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,290
hopefully they're the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

62
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,619
categorization that you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

63
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:25,489
yourself a lot of configuration

64
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,319
directory services<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sharing etc and</font>

65
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:34,370
then of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever-popular miscellaneous</font>

66
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:37,638
category now we sort of took a two step

67
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:39,950
process one was Paul Hoffman of the

68
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:42,980
internet mail consortium generously

69
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,690
wrote a<font color="#CCCCCC"> curl program that scanned all</font>

70
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,768
the RFC is looking for certain buzz

71
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:54,590
words and hot items like eight gmt year

72
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">YY etc etc and we got in fairly lengthy</font>

73
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:00,200
output and listing of those and then we

74
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided that we're going to manually</font>

75
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:08,138
read each and every RFC at the time was

76
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:10,200
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2300 of them that was a bad choice</font>

77
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:12,750
for me

78
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,450
in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read ended up reading</font>

79
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,120
somewhere between 16 and 17 hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSC</font>

80
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:19,620
because no<font color="#CCCCCC"> one else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to do it and</font>

81
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,280
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to get this document off of my</font>

82
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:29,850
plate a lot of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff in</font>

83
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:33,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">there a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of boring stuff too anyway</font>

84
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:35,070
all the research is complete the issues

85
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,020
we've come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been publicized</font>

86
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,479
to the relevant people and like I said

87
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,900
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just awaiting me fixing all of</font>

88
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,060
these margin issues for publications and

89
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,270
as you might expect there's no major

90
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,979
problems from the protocol level we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

91
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,950
to remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what we were looking</font>

92
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:58,139
at but the word few minor issues which

93
00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:01,050
I'll go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly for those of you</font>

94
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:03,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">who happen to be running in x500</font>

95
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,210
directory server particularly something

96
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:09,810
that's older there are some potential

97
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,400
problems with those but they're not

98
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">really widely deployed on the internet</font>

99
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,229
so it'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> more of an internal problem</font>

100
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:21,330
for you now there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple subtle</font>

101
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:26,820
issues in HTTP 1.1 and really an HTTP

102
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:30,030
one out one of the date formats that is

103
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,469
a requirement to be understood is RFC

104
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:37,950
850 addresses which are two year dates

105
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:41,639
and about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year ago we did some</font>

106
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:46,289
analysis of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of the major</font>

107
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:49,650
caching servers and came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

108
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:52,050
twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all traffic that was</font>

109
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:54,450
going through these sites we're using

110
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:57,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> older formats now this is not going</font>

111
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cause any cataclysmic failures at all</font>

112
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,700
what it might do is it might injure

113
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:07,409
interfere with caching characteristics

114
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,139
so it document may the olders<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the</font>

current<font color="#E5E5E5"> one and not get updated or it</font>

116
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:16,349
might be newer than it might be the same

00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:18,870
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current one and get updated as</font>

118
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:21,248
well so there might be some small

00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,379
operational issues as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> increase</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minor problems there I'm sure I</font>

about the DNS serial number issue people

describes what the issues are how to fix

138
00:07:26,889 --> 00:07:35,019
them as Sean mentioned there's a lot of

<font color="#CCCCCC">time stamping that goes on in network</font>

libs so you might get wrong information

out of a network management station and

much into this we examine protocols not

implementations so we looked at smtp but

we didn't dare look at sen neler
