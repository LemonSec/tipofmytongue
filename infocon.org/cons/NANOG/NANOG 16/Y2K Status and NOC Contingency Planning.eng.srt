1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,299
so I start out with a picture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:08,299
enemy this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the new improved</font>

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:33,690
trench digger 2000 it is y2k compliance

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:36,000
and this will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating my slides are</font>

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,129
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> online however the hyphen in</font>

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,890
the URL is in the wrong place apparently

00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:45,890
it is nanog 16 hyphen y2k status dot

8
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:48,980

00:00:55,690 --> 00:01:03,680
page down okay yes our corporate

10
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:11,720
communications department did go over

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:14,149
time on this our legal department also

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,420
went over time on this so let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> care for</font>

13
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:19,280
the lawyers this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> official year 2000</font>

complete without the standard scare

18
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:38,780
statistics this is the latest gaffe

19
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:41,539
humanized survey that was I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">two weeks ago and they surveyed a whole</font>

21
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:45,470
bunch of corporations and they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the figure of twenty-two percent</font>

23
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:50,509
large companies do not expect to have

24
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,360
all the critical systems ready by

25
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:55,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">January one and that's actually up from</font>

26
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,119
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last time they did this the previous</font>

and I claims that seventy two percent

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:06,290
have already encountered failures what's

30
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting is if you go around and talk</font>

31
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:10,610

going to be ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's going to</font>

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,160
be very little chance anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,910
wrong but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something goes wrong it's</font>

37
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,769
going to be someone else so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> all say</font>

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,540
they have a very low chance of failure

39
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:29,390
and their systems but there's a moderate

40
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:30,560
to high probability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of failure in well</font>

41
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,238
if you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the electrical industry</font>

42
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,799
they say it's in the telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font>

43
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,910
if you're in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> software</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry they</font>

44
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:39,680
say it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in the electrical</font>

45
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:42,560
system so no one<font color="#CCCCCC"> really quite knows what</font>

46
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,480
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet itself well</font>

47
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">apparently there is this big belief that</font>

48
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,820
the Internet Society said that the

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet has no year 2000 issues there</font>

50
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:56,239
are several folks in Washington DC that

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,400
are absolutely convinced to this I went

52
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the Internet Society webpage and they</font>

53
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,989
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a year 2000 statement but it was</font>

54
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,959
mostly speaking about protocols and I

55
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:06,930
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next talk is about about the</font>

56
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:10,620
IETF working

57
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:12,930
group and they'll cover that well I've

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,299
also found interesting is many other

59
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,129
industries are now using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as</font>

60
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:19,560
the primary method for distributing

61
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,328
their y2k information even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though most</font>

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those industries have no idea how the</font>

63
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:26,489
internet works or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the</font>

internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> zone why do catering</font>

65
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:32,069
preparedness<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also went around looking</font>

66
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,540
at a few favorite things that we know

67
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:39,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">and love Giga switches ATM switches and</font>

68
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,659
yes people have a GS routers and those

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,579
are all all three of those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples</font>

70
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:47,879
of where vendors have said that there

71
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:52,230
are y2k issues with them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gigot switch</font>

72
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:57,328
were stored you can say sorry the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AGS</font>

73
00:03:52,230 --> 00:04:00,238
router on Cisco says buy a new one ATM

74
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:03,780
switch the the AT&T lucent switch

75
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,419
apparently has some firmware issues so

76
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,250
even though the IP protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed</font>

77
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:12,329
pretty good stuff we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run over</font>

78
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">them all have issues as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they say we're</font>

79
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">not quite sure if they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to break</font>

80
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,449
but they have issues so lots of folks

81
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,099
are replacing those and if you haven't

82
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:21,560
upgraded your gigas which is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

83
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:25,620
firmware<font color="#E5E5E5"> upgrade you gotta get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new</font>

84

firmware from a cable truck AGS<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gotta</font>

85
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,289
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new cisco router although the AGS</font>

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,138
probably will work in the ATM switch

87
00:04:31,289 --> 00:04:37,680
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago ameritech</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> replaced their</font>

88
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:42,440
ATM switch the other question is is

89
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,659
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet wide services who is DMS</font>

90
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">or just general exchange points and</font>

91
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:51,659
inner provider connectivity and of

92
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">course the internet is an industry now</font>

93
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,139
so we're going to blame our problems on

94
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,940
other folks so we say our biggest

95
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:03,259
concerns are probably electrical and

96
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,259
telephone and and cookie vendors

97
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,990
real quickly lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks are putting</font>

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,460
out yqk press releases important thing

99
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,770
to remember is the press releases are

100
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:15,719
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed systems no one puts out a</font>

101
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,169
press release saying their systems

102
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,700
aren't yqk ready the other important

103
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,440
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them are saying that</font>

104
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,380
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have tested and it's completely</font>

105
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,080
successful and there were no glide to 8k

106
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:29,760
issues found on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests except what</font>

107
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,830
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually say is that that was</font>

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">often the second or third or fourth test</font>

109
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:37,320
before there were wife know y2k issues

110
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:41,250
last month<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FAA flew a couple planes</font>

113
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,979
time they tried that test I'm not quite

114
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:52,469
sure what happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the previous three</font>

115
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:58,020
airplanes the telco industry is also

announced that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their y2k ready nanog 16</font>

118
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:15,600
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the other thing is about</font>

119
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,039
people are announcing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're the</font>

120
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,860
vendors are announcing that older

systems or year<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 ready a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

122
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,910
these available systems are available

123
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">only a few days before the press release</font>

124
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:30,060
and ordering through your sales channels

125
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,780
can be a challenging and no one is doing

126
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,610
inner testing with a mix of systems all

127
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,169
the tests are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being done on one hundred</font>

128
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:42,710
percent test beds that use all y2k ready

129
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,710
systems

130
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,000
why do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a contingency plan well</font>

131
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:52,360
everything all my systems for watching k

132
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,340
ready why do I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contingency plan</font>

133
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,210
well let's if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you accidentally miss</font>

134
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,710
something even though you did due

135
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,570
diligence and all those great lawyer

136
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,830
words you might have missed<font color="#CCCCCC"> something or</font>

141
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,849
about contingency plans is it really

142
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:18,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't matter what caused the problem</font>

143
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:23,150
the purpose of the contingency problem

144
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:28,099
is to deal with the consequences not to

145
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:30,198

since you've ever had to run something

like make the compile stuff that's

202

changed make make will often compile the

wrong things because it will get the

a public concern is probably the most

<font color="#E5E5E5">likely event people are all going to try</font>

phone company is very concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

216

that in the next few months you will

00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,319
probably see some several major

00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,940
advertising campaigns to encourage

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,140
people to make phone calls on other days

220
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,790
just so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone doesn't pick up</font>

00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:48,860
the phones at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and see if</font>

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:50,990
they have dial tone oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

the daylight savings<font color="#CCCCCC"> time thing this</font>

224
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,580
this clock problem happens to us twice a

225
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,839
year for most of us and those who don't

226
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,779
actually change your daylight savings

227
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:03,350
time don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this thing but if most</font>

most recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> waltdisneyworld</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other cash</font>

daylight savings times went into effect

231
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,370
because they had

daylight savings time ready catchers

235
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:28,130
history so contingency planning is good

236
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,849
for lots of reasons this is a fun

237
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,470
question how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long is midnight it turns</font>

238
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,940
out local time zones are set by

239
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:37,160
governments and governments have

240
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:41,900
politicians and politicians do stupid

241
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:44,750
things this island who<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed their</font>

242
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,449
name it used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be called the Christmas</font>

243
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:49,220
islands but apparently Christmas islands

244
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,950
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those nasty things to English</font>

245
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,750
Gabe they gave the name to it so they

246
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:56,350
changed it back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original native a</font>

247
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:59,060
name and I came out pronounce that

248
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:02,060
kitchen tomorrow at<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw something like</font>

249
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:07,250
that change their local timezone so they

250
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:10,640
would be the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones so they are now</font>

251
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:12,650
UTC<font color="#CCCCCC"> plus 14 which is an interesting</font>

252
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:18,130
software problem because it turns out a

253
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:18,130
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software only goes UTC plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 12</font>

254
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:31,760
contingency planning so midnight<font color="#CCCCCC"> January</font>

coast time in the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Khitomer an kiddo the Christmas</font>

258
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:46,640
islands and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current thinking is is</font>

259
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,490
they believe they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nortel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VMs 100</font>

260
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,080
switch for that country so nortel is

261
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,300
apparently going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the first ones to</font>

262
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,950
get the call except if the switch is

263
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,280
down I don't know how they're going back

<font color="#E5E5E5">to call</font>

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:10,110
samoa and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nuit is another country</font>

267
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:12,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're at UTC minus 14 so this actually</font>

268
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:15,089
goes all the way until six a.m. east

269
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,249
coast time so you have a total<font color="#E5E5E5"> of forty</font>

270
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,989
nine hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> midnights around the world</font>

271
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:21,299
or 50 hours because there's actually

00:13:18,989 --> 00:13:22,829
another seven and a half<font color="#CCCCCC"> degrees until</font>

273
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,220
you reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> the International Date Line</font>

274
00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:28,529

follow the Sun so if New Zealand<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">down will we get an early warning or</font>

282
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:47,549
will network problems travel at the

283
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,129
speed of light so at five a.m. eastern

284
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:53,540
time well<font color="#E5E5E5"> before anyone has opened up</font>

285
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:56,519
their standby contingency plan knocks

the hard thing about contingency

295

planning is not identifying the risk but

00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:27,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifying that you have the problem</font>

00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:42,629
UPS will just ride right through that

come up with a bit of probable planning

thing is prioritizing or triage you

316
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,280
won't be able to fix everything so you

317
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,800
pick the most important things and you

318
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:18,949
fix those first and you need to pre

319
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,069
identify what procedures and facilities

320
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:24,980
that you will think are available for

321

323
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,640

we're the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet we're going to blame</font>

330
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:52,130
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are unusual traffic</font>

331
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,410
loads everyone comes on in check so the

332
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:58,550
CNN pays see if there's any problems so

333
00:15:54,410 --> 00:16:00,439
CNN goes down I say things like

334
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,229
unreachable internet wide lookup

335
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,600
services like who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in route I put in</font>

336
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:07,550
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mark will probably run to the</font>

337

microphone and say that who is will be

338
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:14,510
ready so I changed that to unreachable

339
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:16,189
even if NSI is ready there are a lot of

340

folks you have to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to</font>

00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">NSI so it may still be unreachable so if</font>

342
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:25,810
you have a problem how you going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

349

356
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,810
communications failures are probably the

357
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,129
key issue which are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> concentrate</font>

358
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:09,530
on the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk about I came up</font>

359
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,690
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the probable scenario that partial</font>

360
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,639
loss of contact information are partial

361
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:15,320
loss of primary communications why is

362
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,120
that probable scenario because that

363
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:21,720
happens just about every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single day of</font>

364
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:25,829
the year on Saturday I was here

365
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,659
I arrived and I was a person who invited

366
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:29,520
me to dinner I couldn't get to dinner so

367
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:31,260
he called her knock and asked the NOC to

368
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,940
page me it turns out my beeper had

369
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,190
broken on Friday so I didn't bring a

370
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">people with me so they couldn't get</font>

371
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of me so every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day of the year we</font>

372
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:42,059
have partial loss of primary

373
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,549
communications so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a</font>

374
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,809
fairly safe probable scenario on january

375
00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:47,549
first we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the exact same</font>

376
00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:51,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems we have every single other day</font>

377
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:59,490
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year credible worst case well</font>

378
00:17:51,150 --> 00:18:01,200
lots of stuff could go wrong people are

379
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,789
critical resource so when you're doing a

380
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,799
contingency plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> I read a lot of</font>

381
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:08,059
contingency plans with just basically

382
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:11,730
assume that your people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be there</font>

383
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:13,320
permanently they won't leave and go home

384
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:15,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">and check on their families and they</font>

385
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,928
won't sleep and they won't eat and they

386
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,549
won't use the bathroom or whatever when

387
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:23,850
you're doing a contingency planning you

388
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:30,539
have to remember that people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

389
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:32,668
other things than save your ass so you

390
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,440
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that more than</font>

391
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:37,049
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your staff will want to check</font>

392
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:39,090
on how their family is doing so assume

393
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:40,950
that you need to rotate your staff also

394
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:43,980
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go home and check to make sure</font>

everything at<font color="#CCCCCC"> house at home is ok you</font>

432
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:32,139
arrive in February there the backorder

433
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:35,950
on large generators right now is that

434
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:39,340
far you need to identify activation

435
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,720
triggers it turns out one problem they

436
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:42,340
have found over and over again with

437
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,710
contingency plans when they go and do

438
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> post-mortem is that people actually</font>

439
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:52,780
never activated them because they didn't

440
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">know they had a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so you cannot</font>

441
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:58,090
have activation of your trigger plan

442
00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:00,010
necessarily be<font color="#CCCCCC"> your not call your call</font>

443
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,740
your network engineer saying we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

444
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:04,990
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if your contingency plan</font>

445
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,700
is that did not lose his communications

446
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:08,410
they will not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to call your</font>

447
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,100
network engineers to tell them they have

448
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:14,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so you need to somehow arrange</font>

449
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,510
your triggers so perhaps your network

450
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,700
engineers will call or check in with an

451
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:20,350
occupationally as they cannot reach the

452
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:26,080
not perhaps there's a problem so they

453
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:28,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">should go do something reactive steps</font>

454
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,060
this is important<font color="#CCCCCC"> because generally you</font>

455
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,940
folks the person first on the scene are

456
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,350
going to be people already there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

457
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:39,610
they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what they need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

458
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:43,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">right away these are your peoples in</font>

459
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,300
your cos or whatever and you may take

460
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,890
different

461
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:47,389
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the length of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failure</font>

462
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:51,740
so you should map those out ahead of

463
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:53,420
time returning to normal operation that

464
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,220
sounds like a simple thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

465
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:57,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">leave that out of a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of contingency</font>

466
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,660
plans it turns out returning to normal

467
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,210
operations is when a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the failures</font>

468
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,700
occur when they turn off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backup</font>

469
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:09,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">generator and the automatic transfer</font>

470
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:14,270
switch does not transfer back and

471
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:17,479
finally the last thing every single

472
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:22,960
contingency plan must have is a graceful

473
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:26,750
going out of business statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

474
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,010
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got this idea not because I</font>

475
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:29,870
thought of it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I got this idea</font>

476
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,530
reading a contingency plan for a

477
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:35,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">hospital if you're running a hospital</font>

478
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:36,680
you do not want the hospital to go out

479
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">of business while you still have</font>

480
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:42,380
patients in intensive care so every

481
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,850
hospital contingency plan includes the

482
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:45,770
going out business<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan where they</font>

483
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:47,480
transfer their patients or their

484
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,389
customers depending on how you want to

485
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,220
do it to another hospital so a provider

486
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:57,650
may want to think about how they would

487
00:22:52,220 --> 00:23:02,020
do a graceful shutdown and actually a

488
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">Patrick Gilmore has experience with this</font>

489
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,860
what alternatives exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

490
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to our internet communications</font>

491
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,370
failure because I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel that</font>

492
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,000
since we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really know what will</font>

493
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:18,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen communications between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knocks</font>

494
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,170
will probably be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important</font>

495
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:22,760
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out what is happening</font>

496
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:25,460
the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what is our primary</font>

497
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,900
method of contacting other<font color="#E5E5E5"> knocks do we</font>

498
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,510
normally call them on the phone or we

499
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,170
normally send them email so we already

500
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">have two methods of reaching other knots</font>

501
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:37,210
when one fails we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use the other one</font>

502
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:40,820
the question is how independent are they

503
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,800
if the phone goes down I have seen can i

504
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:45,350
have seen real contingency plans that

505
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,190
say if the phones are not working we

506
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,189
will fax them

507
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,859
although this is technically it could be

508
00:23:54,940 --> 00:24:00,209
possible and there are systems where you

509
00:23:56,859 --> 00:24:04,239
could do this this was not one of them

510
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:07,119
pagers cell phones same kind of thing if

511
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:08,769
our phones are down will page them if

512
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:10,119
the phones are down how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

513
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:12,489
page them because you can't use the

514
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:15,189
phone to call<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pager company cell</font>

515
00:24:12,489 --> 00:24:17,440
phones some cell phones will work if

516
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,820
it's your phone system that's down but

517
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,799
if the cell phone is routing through the

518
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,678
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> central office that you are your</font>

519
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:29,019
cell phone may not work email same thing

520
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:31,839
tandem things well you may find the

521
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:34,029
tandem thing is is we may have to end up

522
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,489
playing a game<font color="#CCCCCC"> of telephone tag</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it may</font>

523
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:38,799
turn out that I can't call North

524
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:40,839
Carolina but someone in Virginia can

525
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,450
call North Carolina so you may want to

526
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,789
play that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of game you call Virginia</font>

527
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,769
Virginia realized the message down to

528
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:50,769
North Carolina just because of some

529
00:24:47,769 --> 00:24:52,659
weirdness things that you want to do

530
00:24:50,769 --> 00:24:56,829
ahead of time you probably want to get

531
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:58,839
an offline contact list print things out

532
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:04,029
from who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is even though the who is now</font>

533
00:24:58,839 --> 00:25:05,589
says you can't print things out<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

534
00:25:04,029 --> 00:25:08,109
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your backup and</font>

535
00:25:05,589 --> 00:25:09,668
escalation context most knocks have a

backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock somewhere in the country</font>

537
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:13,570
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they don't tell</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone the phone</font>

538
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,859

<font color="#E5E5E5">quite sure how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you reach the backup</font>

540
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:21,279

with all the mergers there are often

00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:34,839
multiple knocks within the companies

546
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:41,468
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to call each other</font>

he manages<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find your weakest point so</font>

your contingency plan you also want to

notify folks that you are doing it one

563
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:37,509
of the major problems is is a lot of

564
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">providers will be very diligently fixing</font>

565

things but they won't tell anyone

they're fixing things so everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

567

gets real worried and starts doing

things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes the problem worse so</font>

569
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:48,668
you want to notify the appropriate

570
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:50,830
stakeholders there's that government

571
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:53,679
word again that means your customers

your peers and anyone else you might

00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:09,609
pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> people off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of whatever they're</font>

579
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,820
fixing and move them to a higher

580
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:14,859
priority thing so you once you activate

581
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,418
your contingency plan it's not

582
00:27:14,859 --> 00:27:18,158
necessarily to fix the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing you</font>

583
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:19,869
originally started on you need to

584
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:23,440
continually monitor throughout the

585
00:27:19,869 --> 00:27:26,049
entire thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like any type of plan</font>

586
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,940
it will never survive its first contact

587
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:30,849
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the enemy so you need to have</font>

588
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:32,940
flexibility that means you need to have

589
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:35,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">people with authority to make decisions</font>

590
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:39,489
if they need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to radioshack and get</font>

591
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:41,440
the part just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because your accounting</font>

592
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:43,090
system is down and they can't get a peel

593
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,789
off the rise they should still<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able</font>

594
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:53,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the part and finally minimize</font>

damage this part the internet is not so

596
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:58,629
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at every provider is real good at</font>

597
00:27:56,649 --> 00:28:00,008
trying to fix their own stuff but while

598
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:02,609
fixing their own stuff they're more than

599
00:28:00,009 --> 00:28:05,139
happy to damage everyone else on the net

600
00:28:02,609 --> 00:28:08,499
we've seen this time and time again with

601
00:28:05,139 --> 00:28:10,689
various BGP problems where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

602
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:12,970
blast<font color="#E5E5E5"> things out in BGP and then they'll</font>

603
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:15,040
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it and it turns out that we</font>

604
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:17,050
have these bogus routes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> supply</font>

605
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,730
around the network and it takes a few

606
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:22,570
days to track them all down and kill

607
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:26,050
them all so you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimize damage</font>

608
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:28,030
and minimizing damage may include that

609
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:30,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">you may need to turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off some of your</font>

610
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:39,850
services to keep them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> contaminating</font>

611
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:41,440
other folks real quickly conclusions

612
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:45,699
lots could go wrong but we don't know

613
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,830
what but my prediction is even though my

614
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,990
very second slides that I wasn't going

615
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,460
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of predictions that</font>

616
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,890
january first won't be that different

617
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:58,240
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even if it's not that different we</font>

618
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:59,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">have problems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every day anyway so every</font>

619
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,030
bit operations plan should have a

620
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:06,129
contingency plan another conclusion is

621
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:09,070
type in public interests may magnify any

622
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:11,680
problems this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the most</font>

623
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:14,110
likely likely problem will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and the</font>

624
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,740
way you avoid that is you communicate

625
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,110
with your customers and with the public

626
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:22,210
people are less likely to panic when

627
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:24,129
well I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bureaucrat tease</font>

628
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,770
but the Red Cross has found that when

629
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:30,960
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that someone is there with</font>

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:33,910
a plan they tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to panic and</font>

631
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,370
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found this to I'm oh I'm a</font>

things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and people are</font>

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,980
amazingly cooperative<font color="#CCCCCC"> you tell them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

636
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,610
of the prey can come through and if you

637
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:47,350
say it in a way that it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

638
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,050
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're doing they will</font>

639
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:51,610
generally do it if you say it in a way

640
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:55,510
that sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you don't know what's</font>

641
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:59,229
going on they will generally go off and

642
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:01,930
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something else and dealing with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

643
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,730
unexpected requires you will probably

644
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:08,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">require you to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to people that</font>

645
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:10,540
you've never talked to before so you

646
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,770
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some method of ad hoc</font>

647
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,290
communications you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say oh</font>

648
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:21,510
well I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find your customer numbers</font>

649
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,510
so we won't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> your trouble ticket</font>

650
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:26,540
yeah you've heard that talk before and

651
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:36,050
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and get over here</font>

652
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:36,050
working again yeah

653
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,290
and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead put it up</font>

654
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:03,230
our PC has gone to sleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some of</font>

00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,060
you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> remembered this the</font>

664
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:46,260
this so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure who to ask for</font>

665
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:50,010
permission<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm driving the port machine</font>

666
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:51,990
crazy so I'll just flip to a page but

667
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:54,240
this actually went through and printed

668
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,530
printed out all the information for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

671
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:02,130
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's nice about it is</font>

672
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:04,800
it's offline you can carry it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with me</font>

673
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:08,130
and as far as i know this does not have

674
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:11,639
any year<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2000 problems i believe this</font>

675
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:16,220
book will continue to open and flip and

676
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,220
turn only<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is it's out of date</font>

706
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:06,260

the telephone companies are on actually

716

723
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:56,159
gone so there are radio networks that do

724
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem is the radio networks</font>

725
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:05,390
tend to only connect people who you

726
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:08,040
really don't care about if any set of

727
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:10,560
ISPs want to do the hand thing they can

728
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:12,600
it just turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

729
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,759
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes peas you do have ham licenses</font>

730
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:16,890
but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are amazing number of people</font>

731
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,690
who thought Morse code was ridiculous

732
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,240
and winning the internet and even though

733
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:23,150
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropped the Morse code requirement</font>

734
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,040
never got their license so the

735
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:28,100
alternative<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to try and get some other</font>

736
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,710
FCC license but yeah that is an

737
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:35,118
alternative and there are folks trying

738
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that okay we've got to do a random</font>

739
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:40,160
questions in a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google I just have</font>

740
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,589
one comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that steve and SG team of</font>

741
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,629
the FCC<font color="#E5E5E5"> licensing requirements with him</font>

742
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm not short internet outage we</font>

743
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:50,270
constitute emergency in the FCC's eyes

744
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:52,570
so I wouldn't really suggest going to

745
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,570
him around
