well marked and I read 100 hundred

infrastructure attack but John yes

156
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,930
aren't they aren't they interested in

157
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,820
injecting something that would be false

158
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,329
into the fiber something that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,130
misconstrued not just not just cutting

00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:22,420
off contact not just cutting off

161
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,510
connectivity but

162
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,529
injecting some sort of fake message like

163
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,380
turn off your network because there's

164

some kind of disaster spanning in her

165
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:35,529

175
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:15,850
much involved and for cutting fibers

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay the task tracker probably see I</font>

and and probably the dust<font color="#E5E5E5"> rag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> racing was</font>

243
00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:03,660
Alice was in public domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the code</font>

244
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,529
was this really and are sure his pain

245
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:08,639
was even

246
00:16:04,529 --> 00:16:11,310
I feel I feel that I did a lot of work

247
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:16,589
but his name never really<font color="#E5E5E5"> known to the</font>

248
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:18,569
outside people deserves recognition it

249
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:22,949
works this way when we have denounced

250
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:27,719
service attacks and you have attacker at

251
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:35,839
the lower left corner and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hacker</font>

252
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:40,019
would normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> send Janelle surf attack</font>

253
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:43,410
package to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> victim with theta with</font>

254
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:47,759
the source address<font color="#CCCCCC"> fickt as the other</font>

255
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:49,469
party so how do you trace how do you

256
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,850
know where the attack is actually come

257
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:57,899
from you read<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what does sugar the</font>

258
00:16:53,850 --> 00:17:00,749
way the works is that we first give his

259
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:05,520
address of the edge office and the

260
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:07,319
nearest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the victim and then south</font>

261
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:11,668
tracker will log<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ad brother</font>

262
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:15,359
and then you solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> a CL and to match the</font>

263
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:18,959
attack packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> partner of heaven and then</font>

264
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:21,990
for the valley in debug mode and and try

265
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,880
to figure out which which interface that

266
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:29,600
the attacks packets come from and then

267
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,149
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the next hub and then and</font>

268
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:38,969
then doing our behalf this is the source

269
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:42,510
to the attacker and the situations that

270
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:45,510
the and then we traced to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boundary</font>

271
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:50,280
album if the attackers from our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

272
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:52,740
is it in on our network we can trace to

273
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,440
the real attacker that's that's good

274
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:59,240
that's great but most of the cases that

275
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:04,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">it raises to the battery with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

276
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:07,350
ISPs and in that case we just send

00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:11,340
messages to<font color="#E5E5E5"> using that to get an</font>

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:33,809
we can be a vast tribe earlier in the

for prevention that's a big onion and I

316
00:20:53,090 --> 00:21:01,970
know be the end people put acl's on

317
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:06,059
their edge routers and city leaders to

318
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:10,020
prevent IP spoofing that's a good thing

319
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:12,750
and definitely a good thing but we don't

320
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:17,400
know about our greatest fear is they are

give us cellular before the damage is

331
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:56,220
being done there's a possibility of

332
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:01,649
possibility of doing that we have an

ongoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> project working on earth and</font>

334
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:11,340
then the tracing capability that

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:14,699
actually is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a young no no</font>

336
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:23,129
and then when a past record doesn't work

337
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:27,080
anymore what's next and the next item<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

rather a sales still for work yeah well

341
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,439
then a tails acl's

342
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:46,250
g cos the blood thing that we're doing

343
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:50,090
temporarily one this year attack we put

344
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:53,090
in an ACL to stop it not to stop it be

345
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:55,309
not to block the attacks so that our

346
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:59,720
customers human laws would still be

doing that were any any way of doing

352
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:23,600
that are due to stop a blocking attack

353
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:31,850
anything not as bad as that one we have

354
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I really really like to have people who</font>

355
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:42,549
and who would tell us about their

356
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:46,159
experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay about attack detection</font>

357
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:49,399
and there are intrusion detection

358
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:53,510
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> are commercially available but</font>

359
00:23:49,399 --> 00:24:00,949
they all rely on building the sniffing

360
00:23:53,510 --> 00:24:03,019
the ethernet<font color="#E5E5E5"> can 100 speed but that's</font>

361
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what it will do you know it that</font>

362
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:08,980
that's not where we have and then for us

363
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,409
you have to deal with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high speed</font>

364
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:18,860
networks yet the deal will see a number

365
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:23,059
of casting networks but this hope we

366
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:25,610
know one vendor or working on the

367
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:28,690
intrusion detection hood which to see

368
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:32,830
the event itself is a has existing

369
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:38,000
commercial intrusion detection system

370
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:39,949
intuition detection software for its

371
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,539
regulation and that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

372
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:47,230
the gig gig gig Ethernet<font color="#E5E5E5"> geeky version</font>

373
00:24:44,539 --> 00:24:51,200
that's hope at least that means that

374
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:52,130
they they think they have way to kill

375
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,260
visalia

376
00:24:52,130 --> 00:25:00,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that high bandwidth and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also become</font>

377
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:04,340
the most of these systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are they</font>

378
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:08,960
gone on general purpose computers and

379
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:13,310
you know the CPU there in the hundreds

380
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:18,020
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> acres</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is easy T probably is</font>

381
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:21,980
workable with the 100 megabit per second

382
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:25,460
ethernet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting gigabit per second</font>

383
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:27,850
ethernet that would be above the regular

384
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:36,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">cpu then we need to come up with tricks</font>

385
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:40,310
then with a high speed and also we know

386
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:43,340
there's a one vendor switch matter is

387
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:45,679
doing working on a project or think

388
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:51,760
about working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on project to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meet law</font>

389

390
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">state the traffic it's a snake pertinent</font>

split off that word they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDC to a</font>

00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:13,040
different location for for analysis for

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:16,900
whatever purpose but wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we don't</font>

395
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:21,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">like doing that the other possibility is</font>

396
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:24,170
is the traffic monitoring system

397
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:30,500
developed originally developed by Libyan

398
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:35,390
s and V be an ibanez was our research

399
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">and development group and in it mci</font>

400
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:42,950
there is that at least a function that

401
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:47,629
way and and it was great great team of

402
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:50,510
people what they have is the the user

403
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:56,780
optical<font color="#E5E5E5"> scan either split off one theme</font>

404
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:59,660
of life and and and won one goes to the

405
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,418
normal traffic the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the guardian</font>

00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:05,970
goes through

407
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:11,009
monitor on right now is Jose 12 speed

408
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:16,019
and OC<font color="#CCCCCC"> for days they're working on it</font>

409
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:19,049
and that's something we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

410
00:27:16,019 --> 00:27:26,460
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with we're going to build their</font>

411
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:31,009
security security analysis on top of the

412
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,009
yard tracking monitoring totally half

413
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:37,440
there's some hope on the earlier learn

414
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:41,039
but still we're really behind and we

415
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:45,980
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's only the OC 12 card</font>

416
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:52,109
available hardware available but our

417
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:56,730
backbone the minimum is I think 60 612

418
00:27:52,109 --> 00:28:03,090
lies so we're very far behind and very

419
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:05,759
so gonna have OCD 48 and it's scary word

420
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,649
word even this were not done<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah there</font>

421
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:14,820
were still out of development that it

422
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:16,830
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> already behind and it will think the</font>

423
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:21,230
other things that about prevention about

vlogging<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I really we really don't have</font>

425
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:30,090
many good solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I like to open</font>

426

up for discussion of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question saying</font>

you can't put it on interconnects but

we're with bgp customers what Kobe it's

actually recommending that anyone do but

it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider nonetheless</font>

517
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,810
they actually took a look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smurfs</font>

amplifiers that were smurfing them and

00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:12,970
they set them up basically they lined up

although the firing squad in a circle

00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:44,230
that this was done in self-defense now

531
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:46,660
your thing and that about the Empire's

about 20 megabits a second of outbound

535
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:56,860
give it a second and basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> he cut</font>

seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be somewhat effective because i</font>

00:34:56,219 --> 00:35:04,538
solution is to route those networks to

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:09,279
give know if they are non-responsive to

particularly sophisticated software that

578
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:26,680
know whether the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next flow capability</font>

579
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:27,750
won't be there for the GSR the swish

space<font color="#CCCCCC"> waters</font>

581
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:39,930
I have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard any firm commitments</font>

582
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:42,060
from Cisco to do that on the GSR is

583
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:48,620
anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else heard anything to that end</font>

584
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:53,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">why the GSR the switch base runners that</font>

00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:57,270
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the packets won't go to the</font>

586
00:36:53,220 --> 00:37:01,589
ghost with a cpu anymore is very hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

587
00:36:57,270 --> 00:37:04,980
do too is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there any intelligence in the</font>

588
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,720
daughters report I asked this

589
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:08,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically about net flow stats for</font>

590
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:11,580
the GSR and they claim that they will be

591
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving a subset of net flow not the full</font>

592
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:15,480
data per session but you'll get things

593
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:17,910
like source and destination IP source

594
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,170
and destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS I don't have a date</font>

595
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,299
or anything like that but you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

596
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:24,890
getting net flow type stats just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

597
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,210
full NetFlow data because it's it is

598
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,700
silicon<font color="#CCCCCC"> based a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more switch based</font>

599
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:31,830
and they don't do as much look up

600
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:38,270
through the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU but you'll get some</font>

601
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:38,270
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> well thanks thank you very much</font>
