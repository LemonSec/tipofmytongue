cancellations not surprising due to

106
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:35,539
travel we had 12 people who registered

107
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:37,910
and did not show up and we had 10 people

is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traditional trend for nanog we</font>

112
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,690
see 25 on average or 21 so 23 is right

113
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,419
there where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would expect the</font>

to the original foundation of nanog at

129
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:50,240
least in my interpretation of here to

130
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:51,859
serve core operators so some future
