1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,670
I

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,809
first this morning we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> russ white</font>

3
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:30,259
good morning y'all welcome to the deep

4
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:36,590
south where they serve ice with their

5
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:39,110
tea we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to have hot tea</font>

6
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:42,199
we want you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have iced tea it's very</font>

7
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">good yes I'm kind of used to this</font>

8
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:46,579
because I was born and raised in atlanta

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:49,069
and you can now say oh I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry for</font>

10
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,690
you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's okay so I'm going to be</font>

11
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,449
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about trade-offs and network</font>

12
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,549
complexity I think we'll pursue this and

13
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:58,549
you'll see what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get at</font>

14
00:00:55,549 --> 00:01:01,150
here they put me hi baby be behind a

15
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:03,769
podium it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drive me crazy I</font>

16
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:05,509
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> fallen off stages before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

17
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:07,100
it's probably good that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

18
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:11,210
a podium in front of me to keep me from

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,429
doing that so let's talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

20
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,929
complexity so how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys know</font>

21
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">what network complexity is this is yeah</font>

22
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,220
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you can give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

23
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:25,699
definitive number for the complexity of

24
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:27,649
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> network right No</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I didn't</font>

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:28,670
think so so let's talk through some

26
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:30,649
stuff here we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

27
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,689
defining complexity how to measure some

28
00:01:30,649 --> 00:01:36,259
complexity so and we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

29
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:38,270
about an interesting idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is in a</font>

30
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:40,219
draft before the network complexity

31
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:43,130
working group or a research group and I

32
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:44,568
RTF that call the complexity trade-off I

33
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,460
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something we actually deal</font>

34
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:48,829
with on a daily basis we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,630
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout as an example given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

36
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:52,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do a lot of work and fast rerouted i'm</font>

37
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,869
not saying faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> eval it's a bad thing</font>

38
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:55,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying this as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example of</font>

39
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:57,859
understanding complexity trade-offs and

40
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,619
then we'll talk about whether complexity

41
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:02,649
a little bit so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is network</font>

42
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:05,119
complexity how do you measure this

43
00:02:02,649 --> 00:02:06,859
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting is is there's been an</font>

44
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,410
awful lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in this area recently</font>

45
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:11,269
there is this thing called the network

46
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:14,480
complexity index you may have seen this

47
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:16,670
this is actually based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in social</font>

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,989
media<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks rather than on computer</font>

49
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,089
networks but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar in</font>

50
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,250
many ways and there's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:26,900
little formula there where you have B to

52
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:30,170
the N equals max<font color="#CCCCCC"> j x to the j greater</font>

53
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,060
than or equal to I and then you can see

54
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,619
the actual way to use that formula there

55
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,080
so I expect you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to run right home and</font>

56
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,490
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,310
your networks essentially this formula

58
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:44,130
or this index tries to calculate or

59
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,340
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the interaction between</font>

60
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,470
communities within a network so imagine

61
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a great big pool table the</font>

62
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:54,030
world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest pool table and you have</font>

63
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,520
all these pool balls wandering around

64
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,100
quasi randomly through some magical

65
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,340
force so what network complexity index

66
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,980
does is it says I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a place a grid</font>

67
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,750
over this pool table and I can kind of

68
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,310
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the communities lie and</font>

69
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,930
I can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the interaction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

70
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,300
the communities<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the grid markers and</font>

71
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,160
that allows me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what the</font>

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,810
complexity of the network is so you

73
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,070
might look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a computer network</font>

74
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:22,740
as control plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> state bgp updates ospf</font>

75
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,750
updates is is updates and then there's

76
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,230
that protocol people put on their

77
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:33,390
gravestones what was that oh sorry rip

78
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:35,010
yes so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is based on the number</font>

79
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,869
of nodes the degree of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nose the</font>

80
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,910
mannequin activity the number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> edges</font>

81
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:40,800
and the rate of change<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nodes and</font>

82
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,390
edges and their connectivity so that's

83
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,150
what the network complexity index is

84
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,250
this is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cool measure but we'll</font>

85
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,200
see in just a minute how what it doesn't

86
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,180
measure there's another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> called net</font>

87
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,589
complex that was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see the URL</font>

88
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,769
down there at the bottom of the slide I

89
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:59,730
assume you can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because I can't</font>

90
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,959
from up<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but anyway you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

91
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,600
there's this thing called net complex

92
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,660
and there's a bigger formula there and

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">their metric is to try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to compute</font>

94
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,400
complexity from state and function so

95
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,959
whereas<font color="#E5E5E5"> network complexity index</font>

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,150
actually tries to break the network up

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,738
into communities the net complex

98
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,640
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> tries to treat the control</font>

99
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:22,229
plane is one big<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and it tries to</font>

100
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,950
compute a single complexity number by

101
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:28,080
summing all of the all of the nodes and

102
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">edges against each other and the rate of</font>

103
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">change and stuff this kind of depicts</font>

104
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,190
just kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pits distributed against</font>

105
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:36,780
centralized algorithms a bit I think

106
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,450
centralized algorithms tend to work

107
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,580
better in the net complex number and it

108
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,930
does try to make note of aggregation and

109
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,520
some other mechanisms to hide

110
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,449
information and reduce control plane

111
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">state</font>

112
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:53,199
then there's this draft that's in

113
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:55,960
network complexity research group in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

114
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">I RTF that talks about design intent and</font>

115
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,568
what they're trying to do is they're

116
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:05,110
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a network configuration</font>

117
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:07,389
of a device and break it down into

118
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,289
independent components and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font>

119
00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,520
out the relationship or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network of</font>

120
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,830
connectivity between the different

121
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,770
configuration components in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device</font>

122
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,998
itself so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

123
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,620
because they're working at the problem

124
00:05:18,999 --> 00:05:22,650
from a different direction they're

125
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,330
working at the problem from objects

126
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,460
references and a referential<font color="#E5E5E5"> link so</font>

127
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:29,258
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting concept that</font>

128
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,289
they're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay what's</font>

129
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:35,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem with all these these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

130
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:37,810
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty good tools for figuring out</font>

131
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:39,039
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network complexity numbers but</font>

132
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,620
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of problems with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

133
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,289
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all they focus on a very small</font>

134
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">part or small slice of what i would</font>

135
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,279
consider overall network complexity

136
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,310
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of these tools</font>

137
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,649
tried to provide an absolute measure in

138
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,749
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one specific area that it's dealing</font>

139
00:05:53,649 --> 00:05:58,479
with for instance control point state

140
00:05:55,749 --> 00:06:01,419
the rate of<font color="#CCCCCC"> change can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> measure these</font>

141
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">things and figure them out the problem</font>

142
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:06,039
we have is is that systemic complexity

143
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:08,529
isn't an absolute number like this I

144
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,789
cannot look at my control plane state

145
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:12,550
and figure out what the overall

146
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:14,770
complexity of my network is why because

147
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">my control plane state includes things</font>

148
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,620
like aggregation information hiding

149
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,628
through layering of topologies virtual

150
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:25,089
overlays actually our information hiding

151
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:27,430
techniques so how am I actually into

152
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,229
relating these different control plane

153
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,529
sets in different control plane<font color="#CCCCCC"> states</font>

154
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:35,020
to an overall complexity number so these

155
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:37,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">are good tools but they only cover us</font>

particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> small slice a second problem</font>

157
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:44,199
we face is is that if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back to my</font>

pool<font color="#CCCCCC"> my my big pool table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have all</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of these balls rolling around sendai</font>

160
00:06:45,849 --> 00:06:50,919
semi randomly networks aren't built that

161
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:53,319
way right there are some aspects of

162
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:55,269
network design that are quasi random for

163

00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,500

166
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,550
on some<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a practical</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fractal</font>

168
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,880
out some things about traffic flow but

169
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,020
in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks are organized I mean</font>

170
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,000
we're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> network designers and</font>

171
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:15,130
architects right what we do is we design

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,169
networks to solve certain problems so

173
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,600
there's an intention issue here so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

177
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:28,930
through some magical process all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

184
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:51,160
quote here from a guy writing dr. Weaver

185
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,289
writing in 1948 on this entire topic he

186
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,720
says this is at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very beginning of</font>

187
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,190
the statistical analysis phase of big

188
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,590
data you might call it when they were

189
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,150
first doing some sort some of this type

190
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,020
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff we're doing in big data to do</font>

191
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:08,320
statistical analysis today he<font color="#E5E5E5"> said they</font>

192
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:10,359
are and he's talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about biological</font>

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,580
processes and some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

194
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,860
deal with complexity problems which

195
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,500
involved with dealing simultaneously

196
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,960
with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sizable number of factors which</font>

197
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:22,479
are interrelated into an organic cold or

198
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,340
systemic so they actually interoperate

199
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,990
with each other they are all in the

200
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,830
language here proposed problems of

201
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:31,750
organized complexity so in 1948 dr.

202
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:34,179
Weaver was making the point that we have

203
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:36,400
very good at that point they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

204
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:38,319
very good strides in disorganized

205
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,179
complexity we've actually made a lot

206
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,880
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> strides and disorganized complexity</font>

207
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:46,770
to this point somewhat<font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 years later</font>

208
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,570
but 65<font color="#E5E5E5"> years later whatever it is but in</font>

209
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:51,310
the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of organized complexity we</font>

210
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,800
still haven't done a very good job of

211
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:57,219
dealing with organized complexity so

212
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:01,209
somehow or another we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to learn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

213
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:03,579
deal with intent so now let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font>

214
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:07,599
the way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with</font>

215
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:08,769
intent and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> through complexity</font>

216
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,189
trade-offs

217
00:09:08,769 --> 00:09:15,999
right Eric<font color="#E5E5E5"> Osborne was a friend of mine</font>

218
00:09:12,189 --> 00:09:20,170
always says you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know complexity is what</font>

219
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:20,980
you don't understand right so the first

220
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,199
thing we have to realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

221
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,509
complexity is complexity is here to

222
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:27,429
solve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem when I do a network</font>

223
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:30,279
overlay I'm adding complexity my network

224
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:32,920
if I use an<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpls L through VPN or VX</font>

225
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,629
land or some other tunneling mechanism

226
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok you can yell yell at me now because</font>

227
00:09:34,629 --> 00:09:39,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't think mpls is tunneling but</font>

228
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:41,649
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok anyway some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tunneling</font>

229
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:43,269
mechanism to get through solving a

230
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,100
specific set of problems I've added

231
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:47,829
complexity in my network I've added

232
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,689
another control plane but I've done it

233
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:51,579
to solve a specific problem so

234
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:53,679
complexity has no meaning outside the

235
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,349
context of the problems being solved

236
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,209
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hauser to be a lot simpler to</font>

237
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">build if everybody used nails for</font>

238
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:02,799
everything but they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> will use</font>

239
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,399
screws for our purpose screws are more

240
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:10,420
complex than<font color="#CCCCCC"> nails but we use screws for</font>

241
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,679
our purpose that's one of my favorite

242
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:13,149
lines in the world by the way right

243
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,339
there how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> balloons fit in the bag</font>

244
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:17,709
so the other thing is is complexity

245
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:20,799
versus your tool set right more complex

246
00:10:17,709 --> 00:10:23,739
tool problems can be managed with better

247
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,899
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right I know everybody sitting</font>

248
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,519
in this room probably has Perl scripts

249
00:10:25,899 --> 00:10:31,119
or Python scripts that manage their

250
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,499
configurations right nobody here goes

251
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:36,069
out and manually manages their

252
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:37,540
configurations on their boxes which what

253
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:39,519
we've done is we've actually taken a

254
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,920
complex problem managing a diverse set

255
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,689
of configurations across a large number

256
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,628
of devices and we've reduced the

257
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:49,299
apparent complexity by adding a tool to

258
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:51,069
the problem so again if you're only

259
00:10:49,299 --> 00:10:53,139
tools a hammer every problem looks like

260
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:57,099
a nail but what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a nail gun</font>

261
00:10:53,139 --> 00:10:58,689
or a sonic screwdriver of course nail

262
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:01,179
guns are harder to maintain than hammers

263
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:03,309
and sonic screwdrivers are notorious for

264
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:06,279
breaking if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody watches Doctor Who</font>

265
00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:08,799
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know nonetheless they're</font>

266
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,929
effective tools so there's a trade-off

267
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,759
here as well there's the complexity

268
00:11:10,929 --> 00:11:15,819
versus the skill set I don't know about

269
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:17,679
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> but when i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was in cisco tat all my</font>

271
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:23,079

they're doing some of your guys are dead

intelligent but a little bit bashful

277
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:33,790
it's great illustration but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't</font>

278
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,620
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a matter of intelligence it's a</font>

279
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:37,300
matter of focus in training you've got

280
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:39,520
to have the right skill set to apply to

281
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,219
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right problem so the more you're</font>

282
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,050
better your skill<font color="#CCCCCC"> set is the better your</font>

283
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,810
ability to handle complexity of various

284
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:48,609
types another thing we often don't

285
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:52,930
realize is that complexity comes in

286
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:55,510
pairs this is an RFC 1925 a couple of

287

quotes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> RFC 1925 one of my favorite</font>

288
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:00,610

problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> around by moving the problem to</font>

it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to add another</font>

00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:12,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">layer of indirection so quite often we</font>

294
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:14,020
decrease complexity in one part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

295
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,859
system but we end up increasing

296
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,329
complexity in another part of the system

297
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,920
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have this cute little complexity</font>

298
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,920
graph but I'll give you one example here

299
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:29,980
here I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have or even here in any of these</font>

308
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">reduced the apparent complexity in my</font>

309
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,910
network by adding Python scripts or Perl

313
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,410
somebody's got to manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scripts and</font>

314
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,570
somebody's got to manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the application</font>

315
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,160
so yes I've reduced my apparent

316
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:08,200
complexity but I've added complexity

317
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,990
back somewhere else so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of this</font>

318
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:13,450
slide is is that complexity has a

319
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,670
counter complexity when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I add a tool or</font>

320
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,230
I add something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce my complexity</font>

321
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,569
I'm actually increasing complexity

322
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,750
somewhere else I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware of</font>

323
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:25,270
this and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it I can't just</font>

324
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:28,030
throw complexity over the fence to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

325
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:30,699
network management guys you know you

326
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:32,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">just can't do it you can do it but it</font>

327
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,260
won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work but so long and then that</font>

328
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:35,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">part piece of the</font>

329
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,910
or it will fail so then partially also

330
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,890
my third line here is my function line I

331
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,990
have a particular set of services I'm

332
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:43,939
trying to offer as I increase the amount

333
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,520
of services I'm trying to offer clearly

334
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,530
my complexity level has to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up so</font>

335
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,930
there's a sweet spot between complexity

336
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:54,860
counter complexity and function that

337
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:59,569
I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get to if I ever watch the</font>

338
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,130
movie the point no you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know as the rock</font>

339
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">man says you don't have to have a point</font>

340
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:08,780
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a point but anyway you can never</font>

341
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:12,110
reach some desirable goal without adding

342
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,699
complexity decreasing complexity in one

343
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,490
point will nearly always increase

344
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,990
complexity somewhere else increasing

345
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:21,460
service levels or solving hard problems

346
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:24,380
is always going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase complexity</font>

347
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:28,400
so some bad questions how complex is

348
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,800
this my favorite will this scale my

349
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:34,310
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to will this scale as always how</font>

350
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,160
many balloons fit in a bag I have no

351
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:40,640
clue let's think about all the possible

352
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:42,800
situations and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay good</font>

353
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:47,050
questions where will adding this new

354
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:50,959
thing overlay protocol control plane

355
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:54,319
tool piece of training<font color="#CCCCCC"> increased</font>

356
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:56,570
complexity if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I reduce complexity here</font>

357
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,210
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I increase complexity and if I</font>

358
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:01,790
reduce complexity here where we r sub

359
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:03,650
optimal behavior show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i'm going</font>

360
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:06,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to paraphrase yak off for a</font>

361
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:09,020
minute you can bring your traffic to the

362
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:15,290
service or you can bring your<font color="#E5E5E5"> service to</font>

363
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:17,329
the traffic right pretty much so I love

364
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,130
network virtualization network function

365
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:20,120
virtualization it's a cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but what</font>

366
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,640
are you doing you're bringing your

367
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,710
packets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service which does what</font>

368
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:26,960
which increases stretch in your network

369
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,940
which means you're actually using more

370
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,250
bandwidth to get stuff between services

371
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,690
so what you're actually doing when you

372
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:34,520
look at service chaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all these</font>

373
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,740
other solutions again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying</font>

374
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're bad solutions I'm just being</font>

375
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,150
realistic about what you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

376
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:43,370
you're increasing stretch increasing

377
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,649
bandwidth increasing jitter increasing

378
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,360
latency in order to reduce the number

379
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,790
of places you inject policy in your

380
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,680
network it's pretty straightforward it's

381
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:54,129
not necessarily a bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> trade-off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

382
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,559
a trade-off we've got to be conscious<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

383
00:15:54,129 --> 00:16:00,740
so complexity that the systemic level is

384
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,420
about trade-offs not absolutes so here's

385
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,100
fast free bout as an example if

386
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,079
anybody's interested in other examples

387
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are other examples in the slide</font>

388
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,679
set after<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end slide that you can</font>

389
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:13,550
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've worked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through some</font>

390
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:16,519
other ideas so just to give this just

391
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,748
just one<font color="#E5E5E5"> example all right fast free</font>

392
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">well I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working in fast free</font>

393
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:22,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">route for an awful long time think about</font>

394
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:25,519
how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through and routing what was</font>

395
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:29,179
the maximum convergence time of an I grp

396
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:33,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">network naughty a grp igrp nine minutes</font>

397
00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:36,740
rip 180 seconds to the three minutes

398
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,929
ospf if you count all your timers out

399
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:42,619
your maximum is in the three minute to

400
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:44,420
two minute range so what did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we</font>

401
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">try to make it route faster so what do</font>

402
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:50,420
we do first thing is we do L FAS and we

403
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:53,120
do a pre compute we know in this case

404
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,040
that a has a best path through be to eat

405
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,600
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we know that it has an alternate</font>

406
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,699
path we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see it on the network</font>

407
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,410
diagram the routing protocol can't see

408
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:02,719
it because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way the metrics work</font>

409
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,209
right this is effectively the

410
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,610
feasibility condition any a grp if my

411
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:10,459
backup path or my alternate path is more

412
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:13,339
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cost of my best path I cannot</font>

413
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:15,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust the path not to be a loop from a</font>

414
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,398
routing perspective so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ella phase are</font>

415
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,898
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing I'm just</font>

416
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:20,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at my metrics and I'm just</font>

417
00:17:17,898 --> 00:17:23,148
saying hey this might be a loop I can't

418
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:26,839
use it or will create a micro loop if I

419
00:17:23,148 --> 00:17:29,360
use this so in this case I do a pre

420
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:32,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">computation and I actually discover that</font>

421
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,399
a can you see as its next path<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

422
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,199
though it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best path I actually</font>

423
00:17:34,399 --> 00:17:39,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">precompute out that it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

424
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,539
loop using some clever math and make it

425
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:43,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">work so here's what's called a loop-free</font>

426
00:17:41,539 --> 00:17:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">alternate they can compute the cost of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> C</font>

427
00:17:43,789 --> 00:17:50,000
to determine traffic forwarded to the

428
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,580
destination in this case 192 02 / 24

429
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,889
will in fact be looped back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a if it's</font>

430
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,840
sent to see if not that a can install

431
00:17:54,889 --> 00:17:58,520
the path through see is a backup path I

432
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,470
get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of faster convergence what's</font>

433
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,230
my cost

434
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:04,179
see the point is there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complexity</font>

435
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,890
trade-off here what's my complexity

436
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:08,200
trade-off I get faster convergence I get

437
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:10,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">better optimality in my network what's</font>

438
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,039
my trade off I have an additional

439
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,419
computation today I have to run SPF a

440
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:16,690
different way or have to run it multiple

441
00:18:13,419 --> 00:18:18,070
times frankly this is almost nil second

442
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing though from a network designers</font>

443
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:23,379
perspective is I now have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

444
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:27,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">see is an alternate path which means</font>

445
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:30,520
quality of service it means bandwidth it

446
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,799
means jitter it means delay it means

447
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:34,179
thinking through if I want a to have an

448
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,679
alternate path where I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

449
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:38,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">that alternate path and how it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

450
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,020
to work so now let's go one step further

451
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:44,110
let's do tunnel del FAS if I tunnel into

452
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:46,270
cute I have peace based in queue space

453
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:48,219
and essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to get to a</font>

454
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:50,230
point in the network where a<font color="#E5E5E5"> can safely</font>

455
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,270
tunnel traffic and have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

456
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,940
dumped towards the destination rather

457
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:57,429
than looping back to a if C is not there

458
00:18:54,940 --> 00:19:00,159
i<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go past see i can compute and go</font>

459
00:18:57,429 --> 00:19:02,830
past c and sadie is where i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can dump my</font>

460
00:19:00,159 --> 00:19:05,919
traffic great so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can dynamically build</font>

461
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:07,600
a tunnel through<font color="#E5E5E5"> C so I skip see because</font>

462
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,150
if i send the traffic to see in this

463
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,549
case it'll loop back to a so I skip CI

464
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,580
tunnel around see I get to d<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know d</font>

465
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:16,418
won't loop the traffic back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

466
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,820
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ways of doing this</font>

467
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:21,370
right there's not via there's mrt

468
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:26,350
there's remote LFA there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

469
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:28,449
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways you can do this there are</font>

470
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,770
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> computation mechanisms mrt is</font>

471
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,809
different than not via which is

472
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:33,250
different than remote LFA and there's

473
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,720
different tunneling mechanisms almost

474
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,309
everybody's down to mpls<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

475
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,650
tunneling but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely no</font>

476
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:41,490
reason you can use GRE or something else

477
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:45,100
in this situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tunnel past see</font>

478
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:47,830
what are my gains<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have relaxed network</font>

479
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,230
design rules before when I looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

480
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:52,510
network design a ring meant I was either

481
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:55,090
going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a micro loop in my</font>

482
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:57,220
convergence or I was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

483
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,539
sort of slower convergence I can

484
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,640
eliminate my Michael oops i can do

485
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:02,470
faster convergence what's my cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

486
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,590
additional computation today again

487
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:08,740
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> nil SPF cost</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to run in</font>

488
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:11,408
the real world but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to have a</font>

489
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,750
dynamic tunnel all right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have</font>

00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:42,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">all this other stuff right so basically</font>

502
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point is is that there is a</font>

503
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,950
trade-off here and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

504
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that trade office network</font>

505
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,520
designers and architects and not just

506
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,830
assume that I'm getting and I'm not

507

giving anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wither complexity</font>

508
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:57,820
where do we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all this stuff well</font>

509
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:59,860
we ever have a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> number that tells</font>

510
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:04,600
us how complex a network is my opinion

511
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">is no because networks are systemic and</font>

512
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're intentional design is</font>

513
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,739
intentional I don't yet know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

514
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,360
measure intent there may be somebody out

515
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,610
there who<font color="#CCCCCC"> can figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to measure</font>

516
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,040
intent and relate it to a set of

517
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:20,229
configurations and policies and say oh

518
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:23,170
you intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network to solve this</font>

519
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,760
problem and therefore i can give you a

520
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,170
complexity number for the minimum

521
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:29,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">complexity that will be able to solve</font>

522
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:33,130
that problem but then how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your</font>

523
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,889
networks only solve one problem yeah I

524
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,630
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think so nobody's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network solves</font>

525
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,730
one problem everybody's network in the

526
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:41,500
world solves multiple problems so now

527
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,390
you've got to interact intent which then

528
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,800
becomes a matter of business policy and

529
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,360
I've got to start thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

530
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:48,460
intent is more important than the other

531
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,830
intent and stack ranking things in

532
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,120
figuring that out I do however think

533
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,919
that we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of numbers</font>

534
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,439
before this is over with it will help us

535
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:59,080
characterize specific parts like what is

536
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,970
my control plane state if I do this what

537
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,679
happens if I get a link flap over here

538
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:05,950
to my network complexity how does that

539
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:08,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">all work if i push policy here what</font>

540
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:11,800
happens to my management complexity

541
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,600
versus my stretch in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my network versus</font>

542
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:17,770
my optimality of actually using the

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,090
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the best way possible will we</font>

544
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,460
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something that you can point</font>

545
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:23,560
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says this is complex or that</font>

546
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,990
won't scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

547

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is always going to be the realm</font>

551
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,550
into sharp I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it's</font>

552
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:38,169
always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be again we can use the</font>

553
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:40,540
complexity numbers we can come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

554
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:42,670
to give us some ideas but we're not

555
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:46,059
necessarily or put some definition

556
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:48,070
around elegance but not necessarily to

557
00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:49,780
actually get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where I can</font>

558
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,659
point to a number and say that is too

559
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:55,240
complex so that won't scale now I'll

560
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,640
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one thing is one useful result</font>

561
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,309
I don't know if anybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has noticed</font>

562
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:03,100
but when I first got into networking I

563
00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:07,510
was installing vt100 terminal cards in z

564
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:09,010
100 s at McGuire Air Force Base and we

565
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brilliant to store</font>

566
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:13,390
all of our data in the mainframe so

567
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,309
there's one set of policies around the

568
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,690
data in one control point and one set of

569
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:18,790
user accounts and how beautiful that

570
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,550
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and then people start</font>

them to the financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and blew our</font>

575
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:31,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be really brilliant and try to</font>

578
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,670
right so my point is is that we're

579
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,590
playing this pendulum<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay every two or</font>

580
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:43,720
three years or every five years we say

581
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:46,540
oh look centralization it's a shiny

582
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,030
thing and we're like dory and we run off

583
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,370
after the shiny thing and then we say oh

584
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,620
look decentralization it's a shiny thing

585
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:57,100
and then we go under or we go through

586
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:01,270
the cloud of of jellyfish instead of

587
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:03,309
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over them right part of the</font>

588
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:05,080
point here is is that if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start</font>

589
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,520
characterizing complexity and really

590
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,379
understanding where the trade-offs and

591
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:10,960
put some numbers around the trade-offs

592
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:12,730
where we can and learn to recognize it

593
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,530
for what it is we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop this</font>

594
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,929
back-and-forth complexity or

595
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:19,000
centralization decentralization game and

596
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:22,650
try to right-size the data and right

597
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,090
size<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network where it needs to be so</font>

598
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:27,490
theoretically part of my game<font color="#CCCCCC"> and trying</font>

599
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in the network network</font>

600

complexity research group is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my</font>

601
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,370
experience the networking industry is we

602
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,010
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce the frequency in the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">amplitur</font>

604
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:38,360
of this pendulum swing that we're on and

605
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:45,110
because we're just driving ourselves

606
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:46,490
crazy with it seems like so one way

607
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,110
forward measurements within a framework

608
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,730
trying to build a framework try to

609
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:52,459
understand and lay out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

610
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade-offs we can think of document the</font>

611
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:56,390
trade-offs we find in real life<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

612
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:58,250
the researchers who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are working in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

613
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,170
areas the real researchers that are

614
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:03,710
doing the mathematical work can

615
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:05,270
understand better how to matter what

616
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,580
they should be focusing on what the

617
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,470
slices look like and what these what

618
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,270
these slices should do and where they

619
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:12,710
fit into the big pie and we're the

620
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,320
network architects and engineers and

621
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,810
designers being the math guys are really

622
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,399
good at math but I wouldn't trust some

623
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,740
of these guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my network so</font>

624
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,180
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think through what part</font>

625
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:25,940
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can bring to the table as</font>

626
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,040
architects and engineers is to actually

627
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:30,770
lay out<font color="#CCCCCC"> what these frameworks should be</font>

628
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,990
to do this work within second of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it</font>

629
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,850
also could help build a body of

630
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:36,970
knowledge so how many new network

631
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:39,139
engineers do you know walk in and they

632
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:42,260
ignore the power of unintended

633
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,300
consequences right they go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

know install a static route to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

643
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,100
building a body of knowledge where we

00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:05,780
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start training people and</font>

teaching people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be better designers</font>

646

designers through understanding the

648
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,180
trade-offs that we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our own</font>

649
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,560
work I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think would be really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

650
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:16,940
there are a lot of efforts to measure

651
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,889
and describe this stuff I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

652
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,390
the network complexity working working

653
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,160
group actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a research group I</font>

654
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:24,590
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the slide they're wrong it's an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">IRT I've working group it's really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

656
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:28,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's some really good meeting main</font>

657
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:31,070
materials and if some really good drafts

658
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,770
out there in this area that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

659
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:38,419
read the math can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit weird</font>

660
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:39,950
sometimes so you know part of maybe what

661
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">we could do is network engineers is to</font>

662
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:43,010
try to get the mathematicians to explain

663
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,260
themselves in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms that we can actually</font>

664
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand better without having to do</font>

665
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,360
the integral functions and every

666
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:51,280
like that so anyway there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

667
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,290
particular draft this presentation

668
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:55,510
parallels a draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alvaro</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rotana and</font>

669
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have been working on which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is right</font>

670
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,890
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screen design complexity</font>

671
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:03,610
trade-offs and that's within the NCR g

672
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:06,580
so basically bottom line think about the

673
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:08,860
trade-offs if you can get involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

674
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:12,909
the NCR<font color="#E5E5E5"> g and help us define this stuff</font>

675
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,320
it's very useful start thinking about it

676
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,430
in your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own work the trade-offs and</font>

677
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,929
start thinking through some of the

678
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,410
material that's out there in the network

679
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:22,000
complexity field and that is the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

680
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,580
said there are a bunch of other slides

681
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,540
on this that are probably posted if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

682
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:29,860
want to go through some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other</font>

683
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:37,440
examples so that's it any questions we

684
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:41,500
have one minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 54 53 52 5050 Tony</font>

685
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,810
thanks for us Tony<font color="#E5E5E5"> Talbert comcast uh so</font>

686
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,930
what you know I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get left with</font>

687
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,970
the so what of all that you know how do

688
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:50,920
you if you're always squeezing the

689
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:53,340
balloon in one place and then squeezing

690
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:55,630
it another how do you decide and then

691
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:58,300
you know how do you characterize it to

692
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:01,510
your management<font color="#CCCCCC"> you financial people and</font>

693
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,860
then are you again are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> always what's</font>

694
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,220
the complexity that's outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

695
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:09,610
network you know for more staff more

696
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:11,770
skills more money you know more spare

697
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,629
parts deployed all over the place yeah

698
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,000
so I think unfortunately we're than

699
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,650
we're at the nose end of this camel<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

700
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we know enough right now</font>

701
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:24,520
to actually do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have any real result</font>

702
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,770
other than let's go look at this and

703
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,740
figure it out and think about it that's

704
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:31,240
kind of my impression is that I mean do

705
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,670
you think that's accurate or do you

706
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:37,510
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be well I know I</font>

707
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:40,060
guess ways to characterize it and force

708
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:42,820
people to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

709
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:46,379
part of their design discipline is I

710
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">think all yeah the good yeah</font>

711
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:57,740
you're out we have one what we have 33

712
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:59,570
seconds run into the microphone how many

713
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:05,809
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you get the heart ask hard</font>

714
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:09,220
questions that I can't answer all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

715
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:09,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very much thanks guys</font>

716
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,470
you
