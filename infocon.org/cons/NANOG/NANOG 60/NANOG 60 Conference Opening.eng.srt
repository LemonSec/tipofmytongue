back to 56 Marietta where our main

282
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:04,040
Atlanta pop is many of you may be

283
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:07,699
familiar with internap for those that

284
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:10,099
aren't we were founded 18 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

285
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:14,269
core product is an optimized IP transit

286
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,790
service we connect multiple up streams

287
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:19,429
in each of our pops and do performance

288
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:21,579
monitoring and then through real-time

289
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:23,860
performance monitoring and through

290
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:26,329
manipulation of the routing table

291
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,459
optimized for performance basically

292
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:32,388
latency and packet loss across all of

293
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:34,489
our up streams since then we're founded

294
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:36,170
as an IP transit company since then we

295
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,360
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> expanded our product line we've got</font>

296
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:42,259
data centers around the country about 15

297
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:45,829
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them as well as managed hosting CDN</font>

298
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:49,220
and cloud so again glad to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and I</font>

303
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,138
provisioning circuits and that sort of

304
00:13:57,739 --> 00:14:02,660
thing and it can get very challenging

305
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:04,790
but as far as I know everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> went off</font>

306
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,449
smoothly and I think everyone's surfing

307
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:09,430
the internet

308
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,430
