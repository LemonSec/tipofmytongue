00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,039
want to do it securely now when we the

hi layers that means to go from point A

of going up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> down and at least until</font>

recently we thought well<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipsec is the is</font>

at Donna me well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know my wife left</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

never bothered to rekey the lock when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

69
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,599
bought the house the one day I came home

70
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,910
the previous owner had been kicked out

71
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">from his wife and was sitting on my</font>

72
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,760
couch drinking beer watching the game

73
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:12,109
and just kind of thought he moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,849
in and the yard wasn't gated so move on

75
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:15,709
to today in a new house I've got

76
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:17,599
multiple layers<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security so there's a</font>

77
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:19,819
lock box for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maid I've</font>

78
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,280
rekeyed it before I moved in the yards

79
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,869
gated and alarm<font color="#E5E5E5"> this intrusion detection</font>

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,670
it's not enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have layers I've</font>

81
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,299
locked this of lock this of lock that

82
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,980
you need to also detect intrusion so for

83
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,180
secure end-to-end data transfer you

84
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,980
really have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper key</font>

85
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,380
management you have to have multiple

86
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,690
layers<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security and then you need to</font>

87
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,799
detect if an intrusion really has a crew

88
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,100
that's how you secure end-to-end

89
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,690
transport so when we talk layer security

90
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see it in all the Hollywood movies</font>

91
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,130
it's not a Hollywood plot device it's

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,480
really used it works not because you

93
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't get through all the layers which</font>

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,500
report your purpose is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it so</font>

95
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,660
inconvenient that people will just maybe

96
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,709
go attack the house next door so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

97
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:01,760
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about</font>

98
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:04,630
sideways attacks so in talking sideways

99
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,769
attack let's talk about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> concept of</font>

100
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:08,750
mathematical sleight of hand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

101
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:11,030
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the human brain is faced</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

102
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,459
really big numbers we think wow that's

103
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,980
really big I bet that's really secure

104
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,168
and the opposite occurs with the lottery

105
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">you say wow that's a really small number</font>

107
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,739
it's the probability is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small so it</font>

108
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:27,650
works<font color="#E5E5E5"> both ways and here I've got</font>

109
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,410

110
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,900

and clicking

113
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:39,000
the class up and down you can reduce

114
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,729
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 100 possible combinations so</font>

116

117
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,480
would be a backdoor attack which is

118
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,190
basically you take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lumina</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mccann and</font>

119
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,840
you cut a shim out of it slide it down

120
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:54,719
the class then it pops open so that

121

that is you know hardware random number

generation is pretty random but it's

140
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,039
slow and so it's often used as a seed

141
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,600
for a pseudo-random number and if you

142

know how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pseudo random number is</font>

143
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,130
generated then it reduces the possible

00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,560
solution set that's known as lack of

145
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:51,330
entropy and passwords and it can have

146
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,090
very dramatic effects especially if

147
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,520
you're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> aes encryption so here's</font>

148
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:58,739
an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a brute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> force attack</font>

149
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,650
means I'm just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try everything I</font>

150
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,610
can until I get the answer so<font color="#CCCCCC"> brute</font>

151
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">forcing would be used the</font>

152
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,330
high-performance computer you through

153
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,710
every possible key combination but the

154
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,330
trick is you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have to get</font>

155
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the every permutation you only have to</font>

156
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,500
go through every guess and relational

157
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:16,260
data especially this day and age of

158
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">social media dramatically reduces the</font>

159
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,909
entropy of those passwords so here's an

160
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,800
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a supercomputer we</font>

161
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,200
could never ever build one that can

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,690
check 10 to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18th</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keys per second and</font>

163
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,050
would we still require 10 to the 51

164
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:34,980
years to find all the key space of a 256

165
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:36,930
AES pretty secure right well the again

166
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,950
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> trick is you don't you don't look</font>

167
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,230
for every key you look for every

174
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,559
add on top of that relational data that

175
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:57,479
you can gather from social media people

176
00:06:55,559 --> 00:07:00,689
maintain today or<font color="#CCCCCC"> just anything known</font>

177
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,789
about this particular solution set you

178
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:04,979
can crack this in mere minutes so this

179
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,349
password there at the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font>

180
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,508
went into a hacker form and a person

181
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:12,300
running a minor mining password mining

182
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,009
rig he actually did the reverse problem

183
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,080
he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what would be the password</font>

184
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would be the hardest for my mining</font>

185
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,079
rig to to uh to solve for and this was

186
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,119
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the four passwords he spit out in</font>

187
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">various runs so unless your password</font>

188
00:07:24,119 --> 00:07:27,389
looks like that one on the bottom you're

189
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,149
probably not as secure as you think you

190
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:32,819
are so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about the goals</font>

191
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:34,709
of cryptography because everyone thinks

192
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,179
cryptography is about you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

193
00:07:34,709 --> 00:07:38,309
secret decoder ring I'm going to make it

194
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:39,659
so secret and<font color="#E5E5E5"> imma hide that ring and no</font>

195
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:42,149
one will<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever figure out what the</font>

196
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:44,759
contents are but to really be security

197
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:47,429
do beyond confidentiality and you need

198
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,199
to worry about the integrity is can i

199
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,878
detect if someone who doesn't steal it

200
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,249
but just changes it a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

201
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">then authenticity is the person I'm</font>

202
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:57,479
talking to the first I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just handed that</font>

203
00:07:55,229 --> 00:07:59,399
key really the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should have</font>

204
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,808
handed the key to so we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

205
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,819
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> real quickly so you got Alice</font>

206
00:08:00,809 --> 00:08:05,389
talking to Bob and Eve's a naughty girl

207
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:08,279
she wants to listen in on it well

208
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,619
confidentiality would be Eve's not able

209
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,539
to understand the message of Alice but

210
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:14,429
encryption does not protect against

211
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:16,529
manipulation she could go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that date</font>

212
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:18,208
and say well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten dollar transfer is</font>

213
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:22,229
now a hundred-thousand-dollar transfer

214
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:25,829
also encryption and let if it's not done

215
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:28,349
right it can't detect manipulation if

216
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:30,599
you use a cryptographic checksum now you

217
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:33,479
can solve the issue of I i know this

218
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,818
message is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahmad ified and then</font>

219
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,649
authentication is prevents fishing so if

220
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:39,718
someone's pretending to be eat Eve's

221
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,458
pretending to be Bob you can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

222
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">out and no hey I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to send</font>

223
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,878
them my data so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to have all</font>

224
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:47,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">three or there's really no point in</font>

225
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:49,680
trying to encrypt so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

226
00:08:47,579 --> 00:08:51,689
about encryption basics now so symmetric

227
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,508
encryption it's when you use the same

228
00:08:51,689 --> 00:08:56,490
algorithm the same key in you exchange

229
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:58,319
keys i'm old enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember that was</font>

230
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,590
called sneakernet because you used to

231
00:08:58,319 --> 00:09:02,040
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a key</font>

232
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:04,720
fed exit from one side to the other so

233
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,459
your algorithms running electronically

234
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,980
of your data link but maybe the key was

235
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,260
fedex envelope so the disadvantages you

236
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,030
must both have the same key and you've

237
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:15,340
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep it secret you somehow you</font>

238
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to get it from from one end to the</font>

239
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,600
other without it being intercepted so

240
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">AES works on that symmetric encryption</font>

241
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,130
it just round robins through now if you

242
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:27,010
did it on block by block basis it turns

243
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,500
out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very secure you've all seen</font>

244
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:31,150
the penguin diagram where is penguin<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

245
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,740
with block encryption still looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

246
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,560
penguin even though it's been encrypted

247
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:37,780
so we don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on on block boundaries</font>

248
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,479
but across the whole payload so it turns

249
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">out encryption is symmetric encryptions</font>

250
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,800
fast we still use it asymmetric

251
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,810
encryption is well I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to generate</font>

252
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,490
a key pair with public and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a private key</font>

253
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:50,829
the public key can be strip everywhere

254
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,750
but then there's the private key works a

255
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,480
lot better but it's also a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> slower</font>

256
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,820
takes a lot more horsepower so with the

257
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,230
public key you intentionally use an

258
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,330
algorithm that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes it really difficult</font>

259
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:04,780
and takes a long time law processing

260
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:07,090
power to then calculate what that key is

261
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:09,160
and in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a diff helmet</font>

262
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:13,060
algorithm so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we look at the summary</font>

263
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:16,089
chart here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> asymmetric requires secure</font>

264
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:20,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">channel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no but it's slow and can it be</font>

265
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:22,270
implemented in FPGA hardware only

266
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,860
partially can you encrypt a large amount

267
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,939
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> data you're probably not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

268
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 100</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gig links if you look at</font>

269
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:31,750
symmetric encryption well it requires a

270
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,420
secure channel but you know it's pretty

271
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:37,000
fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can put it in fpga and I can use</font>

272
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:39,280
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for line rate data whether it be 10</font>

273
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,680
40 or 100 gig so what we do is we

274
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:44,620
combine both methods you get the best of

275
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,630
both worlds symmetric encryption for the

276
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,850
data because it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> lying rate and</font>

277
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,010
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> asymmetric encryption of the keys</font>

278
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:55,410
you get the benefit of both so let's

279
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:58,420
look at various encryption methods so

280
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,540
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going higher layer to lowest</font>

281
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,880
layer you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do if sec you can buy big</font>

282
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">security appliance and do it and attach</font>

283
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,080
that to your routers or you can

284
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,439
integrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in your layer one transport</font>

285
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:12,790
gear which is a lot more efficient so if

286
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,710
there's only one slot

287
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,360
I'd that sticks with you today or one

289
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,910
is probably yet so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna spend a</font>

290
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,160
little bit time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and that's</font>

291
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:23,380
encryption method versus layer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

292
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:26,650
organized this from layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 on down to</font>

293
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:29,710
layer 1 at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> highest layer doing the</font>

294
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:32,920
most OTV overlay transfer virtualization

295
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:35,200
so in this you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you're</font>

296
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,540
encrypting a piece of it so it has a

297
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">very large overhead you're adding 82</font>

298
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:44,230
bytes to your packet but it's used for a

299
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:46,180
common IP VPN services and the key

300
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">takeaway here is that your only you are</font>

301
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,800
encrypting the payload but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only part of</font>

302
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,569
the header and the checksum is not part

303
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,640
of the encryption and you've got that

304
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">aeg bite over it so let's move down the</font>

305
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,900
stack<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's look at max a quarter s sec</font>

306
00:11:56,530 --> 00:12:01,660
so here I'm adding 32 or 40 bytes

307
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,370
respectively it's hot by hop only at

308
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,170
least currently there's things on the

309
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:09,130
drawing board to make extend that across

310
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:11,050
tops again through digi bytes overhead<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

311
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:13,360
am in this case encrypting the entire

312
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,969
header which is fantastic but my

313
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,980
checksum isn't included with that so

314
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay naughty let's go down to basic</font>

315
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,130
transfer so today most transport

316
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,840
encryption involves encrypting only the

317
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,060
payload the headers not<font color="#E5E5E5"> touched the</font>

318
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,010
checksums not touched but in its

319
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:31,780
advantage there's no bites of overhead

320
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,580
so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> max and throughput so when I</font>

321
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in flight encryption what I'm</font>

322
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,890
talking about is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bulk encryption you</font>

323
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:41,890
take the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> shebang and you encrypt</font>

324
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,460
it and in doing so you have zero bytes

325
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:47,830
overhead so you have maximum throughput

326
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:50,140
and in this case the<font color="#CCCCCC"> check sums included</font>

327
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,640
so suddenly I can do integrity I know if

328
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,230
that person<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the other end if the</font>

329
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:57,240
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> then manipulated news on the</font>

330
00:12:53,230 --> 00:13:00,460
other end so it has a lot of advantages

331
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:03,610
so if you if this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a graph of maximum</font>

332
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:05,710
throughput and this is just shows is

333
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:07,990
over to oversimplify it if you the more

334
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:10,030
overhead you have the less efficient ye

335
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,460
are as packet sizes<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets smaller if you</font>

336
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,130
obviously have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> 82 bite overhead and</font>

337
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:18,670
your packet ends up being only 64 bytes

338
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:23,080
long that's not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient so if you</font>

339
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:25,449
have variable packet sizes then doing

340
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,950
bulk encryption or even encroach at the

341
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,410
transfer

342
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:34,350
layer is going to help you keep maximum

343
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:35,910
throughput vs vs packet size so an

344
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,420
advantage of bulk encryption or

345
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,770
in-flight encryption is that you can

346
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,540
carry any content within it because

347
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:44,970
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just taking what is spit out the</font>

348
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,310
bulk of it and you're encrypting it so

349
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,590
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> within that container you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

350
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,140
still have fibre channel<font color="#CCCCCC"> InfiniBand one</font>

351
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:54,090
gig 10 gig 100 gig 40 gig you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have</font>

352
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,130
all those protocols residing within that

353
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,700
container and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you balk encrypt it</font>

354
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:01,740
you've got maximum throughput so we will

355
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,050
be having<font color="#E5E5E5"> in beers and gears today just</font>

356
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,240
after this later this evening will be

357
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,490
having a live demonstration of 100

anyway come have some beer have some

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:25,470
snacks on us and see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this live demo it's</font>

366
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,390
really pretty cool so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did want to</font>

367
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,490
touch on quantum key distribution and

368
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,780
why all the hype there it's it it tends

369
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:35,760
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this esoteric thing and</font>

370
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,380
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the the</font>

371
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,660
tinfoil hat people are playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with in</font>

372
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:41,970
labs various places and why the high

373
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,579
post I<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain why it's there's</font>

374
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,830
so much hype about that and one obvious

375
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:49,770
aspect is you've got you know entangled

376
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:51,630
photons that due to<font color="#E5E5E5"> quantum effect there</font>

377
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,610
instantaneously transported from one

378
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:55,890
side to the other and the cool thing is

379
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,120
if you mess with one the up you<font color="#CCCCCC"> mess</font>

380
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,010
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one you can tell if</font>

381
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,470
anyone taps it because it changes so

382
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:02,970
I've got I've got authenticity down

383
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,280
there I can tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> famous trying to mess</font>

384
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,980
with anything so intrusion detection

385
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:10,260
reading the key changes it but what

386
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,240
woods often overlooked is that the key

387
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,810
is truly truly random but prevents

388
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,660
sideways attacks because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process of</font>

389
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,329
transmitting that those entangled

390
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,040
photons scrambles and randomizes it to

391
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,770
where it has a perfect random nature to

392
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,500
it so quantum key distribution has a lot

393
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:31,079
of benefits it's not as esoteric as it

394
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,640
used to be and at ofc this year just

395
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">next month we're going to be talking</font>

401
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:49,980
did want to touch on some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recent</font>

402
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,750
vulnerabilities that have been exposed

403
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,070
well I have to say well I fully maybe

404
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:56,050
I'm a bit naive<font color="#E5E5E5"> but while I fully</font>

405
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,360
support what has come out recently from

406
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:00,339
our government standpoint I'm more

407
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,560
worried about what others might do with

408
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and it's kind of a balancing act if</font>

409
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,449
encryption is too hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> break then you</font>

410
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,569
basically give threats total anonymity

411
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:13,110
which is probably not a good thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

412
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,280
if encryption is too easy to break then

413
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,710
threats have access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your data and</font>

414
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,810
you know and some teenager living in his

415
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:21,340
parents basement russia may have access

416

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your credit card data is happen</font>

417
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:26,320
recently so it's kind of a balancing act

418
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,510
between the two so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

419
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,010
some specific examples that have come

420
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,750
out recently so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running a</font>

421
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,150
cloud you really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> treat all</font>

422
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,560
internal data like its external even if

it you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> its internal to your</font>

everyone in the world so assume there

433
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,400
will be a breach and design accordingly

434
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,190
you shouldn't assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> a single point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

fiber and various peering access points

439
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:18,370
all data is probably being copied off so

440
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:20,679
you need to secure all all your links

441
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:22,448
and and this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I really want</font>

00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to touch in here we all think of well</font>

my laptop or my smartphone everything's

445
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,699
in the cloud and I'm connecting to that

446

cloud and reality the clouds all around

447
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,500
us we connect to it our data now becomes

448
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,300
global the second is uploaded and this

449
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,150
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a specific example this came</font>

from NBC News and it shows a real

before the revelations came out of the

00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,230
chair of that effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gilmore came out</font>

467
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:20,790
publicly with the letter saying he felt

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,340
uncomfortable that it was sort of

469
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:24,780
compromised from day one and examples he

470
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,520
gave not mine is that the same

471
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:29,340
initialization vector is used throughout

472
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,290

473
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:33,809
those initial ation initialization

00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:35,820
vectors<font color="#E5E5E5"> null encryption was put in his</font>

475
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,889
option what that is is you can go flip a

476
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,270
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the payload will run unencrypted</font>

477
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:42,750
but both ends<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's still encrypted</font>

478
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:45,120
that's much easier to decrypt if sec now

479
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,890
because my were more my little bug

480
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,959
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to fully decrypt which</font>

481
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,520
takes a lot of processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> power I just</font>

482
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,070
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> locate a bit and flip it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

483
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,690
then everything from point to point son

484
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:59,760
encrypted and I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do a bulk</font>

485
00:18:54,690 --> 00:19:01,710
transfer 50 60 s and diffie-hellman were

486
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,429
seen as not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily the most secure</font>

00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:10,350
and wins Linux implementation was never

489
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,300
secure since day one wasn't part of the

490
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,070
efforts and if you're using those

491
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,960
hopefully you've written your own your

492
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,389
own thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

493
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,700
at the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> hip SEC was written</font>

494
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:23,340
processing power was a lot less than is

495
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,429
today and so at the time there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

496
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,770
worry that there'd be total anonymity to

497
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,690
anyone running IPSec and so maybe these

498
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,490
hooks were put in because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fear of</font>

500
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:40,170
there's so much processing power that if

501
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">sec and has become much more easy to</font>

502
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,770

503
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,320
to understand its limitations and then

504
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,679
you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> up second and it's fine the</font>

505
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,030
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> given recently was bull run this</font>

a way that traffic can be diverted and

508

always sitting online request comes in

511
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,900
boom is decrypted at will so understand

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to touch on the topic</font>

of penetrating private network so

514
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,720
there's assumption hey I've got this

515
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:14,610

your staffs you can work around those so

563

don't assume that since you use a

everywhere you buy stuff is a potential

problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with transport layer encryption</font>

652
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:52,370
is that you're depending upon your

653
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:55,580
transport provider to maintain your

654
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:58,370
security and since your traffic is

655
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,620
decrypted at every node that

656
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:03,199
dramatically increases the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

locations where compromise might occur

658
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:09,409
if you're relying primarily upon

659
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:11,480
application layer encryption only the

660
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:13,789
end stations are able to decrypt it

661
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:17,149
really doesn't matter what's compromised

662
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:19,190
in between so I'm a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> confused as</font>

to how<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving the encryption into the</font>

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,049
transport layer would increase security

<font color="#CCCCCC">gray that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very valid question and</font>

if you're in between nodes have routers

00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,408
or higher later gear the traffic wat to

00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:21,320
you're actually doing stuff there at the

689
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:24,019
higher layers then I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest then</font>

690
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,460
it is a point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability and you</font>

692
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,019
that's more case to use transfer lyric

693
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,700
which is not an additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of</font>

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:35,720
vulnerability that must be secured with

699
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,469
if you are going it was a vulnerability

700
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:47,800
anyway imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're the thing you're</font>

already encrypting the data and you're

not really getting any additional value

709
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:11,590

remove the SSL and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put the</font>

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:46,800
jump to their easy for me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

722
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:49,980
there there you go could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain the</font>

723
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:54,220
encryption too hard to break concept

724
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:57,550
that was a so if you look up various

725
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,550
pundants of to encrypt or not encrypt

726
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:02,050
what levels required and who<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have</font>

727
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:07,930
access to you should notice it almost

728
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:10,389
becomes an ethical question for people

729
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,610
who are talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the what society</font>

730
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,220
should and should not do and so what I'm

731
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:17,469
explaining there is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're back</font>

732
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,900
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> yep SEC first was being worked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

733
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:22,660
there was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion about wow</font>

734
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:25,120
if it is too hard to decrypt such that

735
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,800
even nation-states people with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

736
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,310
almost infinite resources at the

737
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,230
disposal can't get into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> then maybe</font>

738
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:35,050
there's an additional vulnerability for

739
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,420
the nation as a whole that<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes more</font>

740
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,919
of an ethics issue so at the time there

741
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,110
was a lot of discussion and now it's

742
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,510
recom up again from sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

743
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,270
different aspect of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wow is it now too</font>

744
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:48,670
easy to decrypt some of this and so it's

745
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:51,220
this balancing<font color="#CCCCCC"> act of what makes sense</font>

746
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:53,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously I'm just one citizen one</font>

747
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,730
opinion I think that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

748
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,100
everyone will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to decide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

749
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:59,320
themselves and nations on a broader

750
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,290
stage will have to kind of decide where

751
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:04,220
they lie on

752
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:05,990
on the spectrum this balancing act<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

753
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,670
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> some people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room would</font>

754
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:10,030

00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:15,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">threats to against which they protect</font>

756
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:18,560
but thank you correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> matthew matthew</font>

757
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:21,470
off from amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just curious when</font>

758
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:25,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">you do transport encryption does that</font>

759
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:30,950
raise or lower the risk of an attack

760
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:34,550
because you know how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plaintext is is</font>

761
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:39,590
arranged to say that these if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if you</font>

762
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:41,840
encrypt with<font color="#CCCCCC"> your payload with ssl then</font>

763
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,240
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what form that payload</font>

764
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:47,209
may take so when you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing an attack</font>

765
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,840
on the encryption as people have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

766
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:53,180
over many years you don't know what's

767
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,030
inside but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you encrypt the</font>

768
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,640
transport you know that there are IP

769
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:01,520
packets you know what IP packets look

770
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,230
like you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> frames look like you</font>

771
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,990
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the o2 you stuff looks like</font>

772
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:10,040
doesn't that make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it slightly more at</font>

773
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:12,290
risk for attack again a very bad

774
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,690
question a very good one I don't think

775
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:17,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">it makes it more apt for attacked if you</font>

776
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,980
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way we were nice sure</font>

777
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,629
remember which slide the Sun if you look

778
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:25,880
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way we're doing balk encryption</font>

779
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:27,290
here whoops I'll let<font color="#CCCCCC"> you put it back up</font>

780
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,600
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing balk</font>

781
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:31,159
encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're take the entire</font>

782
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:32,540
container itself encrypting everything

783
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,330
including the checksum and all the

784
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:38,060
headers so you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> increased</font>

785
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,379
vulnerability at the edges where where

786
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:41,000
our equipment is where you have to

787
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:44,120
understand what's going on again the

788
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,780
assumption is you it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> better to have a</font>

789
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:51,500
slightly more vulnerability at the end

790
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:53,720
node where you have control of that to

791
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,150
have less vulnerability between the

792
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,240
nodes to where the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is</font>

793
00:31:56,150 --> 00:32:01,880
secure so my argument or least my

794
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,890
opinion would be I'd much<font color="#E5E5E5"> rather be</font>

795
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,920
encrypting at the transport layer on the

796
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:09,140
ends even though maybe that opened<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font>

797
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:10,600
little bit vulnerability there because I

798
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,520
control that

799
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,439
then across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire transversus you</font>

800
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,480
look at most attacks that have happened

801
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,669
they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been people weaseling into</font>

802
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,980
a data center it's been at the transport

803
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:23,919
nodes it's been at simple fiber taps I

804
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,289
mean that is a huge vulnerability point

805
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,240
and I go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the example that if</font>

806
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:30,340
we're encrypting stuff and you're

807
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,250
encrypting the payload only if you're

808
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:36,189
doing bulk encryption I already you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

809
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,890
I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're encrypting I know it</font>

810
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:42,640
encompasses certain frame types and

811
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:44,200
certain headers with mac addresses and

812
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,140
so on I can make much better guesses

813
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:50,190
about plain text then I can if you're

814
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:52,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing payload it gives me as a</font>

815
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,309
someone who<font color="#E5E5E5"> may want to break into it a</font>

816
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:57,928
much better understanding of what's

817
00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:01,149
going on and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just see them the more</font>

818
00:32:57,929 --> 00:33:04,030
structure inside the what you encrypt

819
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,340
the higher high likely it is that you

820
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:07,629
can guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> plaintext and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is how</font>

821
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,600
people have been breaking into this

822
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:13,750
stuff you know I know whenever Bletchley

823
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:15,280
Park was around<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I fully understand</font>

824
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:18,789
what what your argument is and what

825
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:21,520
you're saying I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's the</font>

826
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:24,340
case and maybe we can sync up afterwards

827
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,990
and walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the manner</font>

828
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,168
in which we're doing the bulk encryption

829
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:31,240
does not lend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability if</font>

830
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:33,400
anything I look at these other examples

831
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,620
above it we're only the payload is

832
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,720
encrypted and there it's much<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier</font>

833
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:41,649
especially since the checksum isn't

834
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,600
included to to to reduce the solution

835
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,460
space and understand what's going on and

836
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,649
the manner that we're doing the bulk

837
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:50,140
mode I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken the whole thing as</font>

838
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:51,370
it's going and making our own framing

839
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,530
markers we're not relying on framing

840
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:55,479
markers inside of it the whole balk is

841
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:57,879
flowing through we don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> care what</font>

842
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,100
protocol it is it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter the</font>

843
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,890
bulk going to sew and transport the one

844
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,928
above next-to-last sir yes you can make

845
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">that argument what we're doing is we</font>

846
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:08,619
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even care what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

847
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:10,389
it's just this junk and we're flipping

848
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:12,820
things around and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making our own</font>

849
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,590
framing and we're able to the reframe at

850
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,649
the other end not relying on the

851
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,089
embedded in OT n framing header

framing<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet for anything like that so</font>

853
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:22,739
in our case I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we have that</font>

854
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,449
vulnerability or how that issue I'd love

this design is this going to be an open

standard or is this an advert to<font color="#CCCCCC"> adver</font>

00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,359
transfer vendors are coming out or

865
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:53,309
scrambling to come out with their own

866
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:54,808
versions of transport encryption given

867
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:56,669
the point-to-point nature which has

868
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:59,339
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been highlighted the fact that</font>

869
00:34:56,668 --> 00:35:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">something's proprietary actually is not</font>

870
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:06,150
a big of a deal as it might be I imagine

871
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,670
once the traditional product cycle will

872
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:10,410
occur to<font color="#E5E5E5"> where once everyone has their</font>

873
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,450
own proprietary then you start working

874
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:14,879
together to generalize it and make it

875
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:18,000
less per<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority so that everything can</font>

876
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,420
work together but today its<font color="#E5E5E5"> proprietary</font>

877
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,430
a lot of our financial customers see

878
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:25,380
that as an advantage not a disadvantage

879
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:29,399
they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to be open they want</font>

880
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,779
it to be proprietary and but yeah the

881
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,549
answer your question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is</font>

882
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:39,420
proprietary Michael so Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sinatra</font>

883
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:41,490
yes dent so the to follow up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Matt's</font>

884
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,400
point the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing he was getting at</font>

885
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,529
was the the notion of differential

886
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,200
cryptanalysis and how that knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

887
00:35:46,529 --> 00:35:51,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plaintext and knowledge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

888
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,250
ciphertext can allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

889
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,480
differential cryptanalysis so what you

890
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,869
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to do in that situation</font>

891
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,480
is make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have block cipher</font>

892
00:35:57,869 --> 00:36:04,049
methods that properly defend against

893
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,240
that and so cipher block chaining a CBC

894
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:09,480
encryption is problematic in that space

895
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,788
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so while I would say you know yes</font>

896
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:14,460
it given<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that there are also</font>

897
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:17,460
unknown unknowns and there are things

898
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are only known to certain TLAs the</font>

899
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,339
notion of you know guarding against

900
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,529
differential cryptanalysis becomes more

901
00:36:22,339 --> 00:36:27,450
incumbent on the transport layer because

902
00:36:25,529 --> 00:36:29,039
yes there is a more structured packet

903
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,160
flow that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see there so I</font>

904
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:32,170
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what he was trying</font>

905
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,660
I think if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just basically follow</font>

906
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,160
that process and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you</font>

907
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:39,129
defend against<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as much as you can</font>

908
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:45,190
that that is one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help solve that</font>

909
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:47,760
problem yes thank you I agree great

910
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:47,760
thanks Jim

911
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,960
you
