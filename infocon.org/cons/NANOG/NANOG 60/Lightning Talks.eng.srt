46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,800

this over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so the background to this</font>

50
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,390
is that at the moment what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pairing</font>

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,470
and there's a number of disputes now and

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:04,140
they're among access and content and

a steady flow of messages to nanog and

70
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,190
to regulators and so on and two inputs

71
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,170
presumably to confirm complaints about

72
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:42,060
condition and the focuses so far seems

73
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,850
to be on individual links last week

74
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a poster nanog asking about</font>

76
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,470
what we are looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> is trying to</font>

77
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,780
develop a method to characterize

condition the<font color="#CCCCCC"> extend of into the main</font>

79
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,910
congestion and do so over time our<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal</font>

80
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:03,839
is to have an atlas of<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter domain</font>

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,609
lengths<font color="#CCCCCC"> their congestion state and also</font>

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,010
improve transparency and some grounding

83
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,299
of this debate

84
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,010
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

85
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:16,370
emphasize<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeking feedback and</font>

86
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:19,190
validation so we have a very simple

87
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,530
method we have some vantage points

88
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,070
distributed through the network and we

89
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:27,979
identify a link of potential interest

90
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:32,150
between two networks networks a SI in

91
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:34,719
ASB so we find the border routers what

92
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:38,539
we do is we send a series of packets

93
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,370
towards a destination that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an that</font>

94
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:42,219
will cross that link but we time we

95
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,830
limit the packet we asked it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout</font>

96
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the knee router we send another</font>

97
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:50,810
packet and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask to timeout at the far</font>

98
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,240
outer and so we've collected two times

99
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,470
since one sorry two round-trip times one

100
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,539
from the near end of the link and one

101
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,930
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the link and we do so</font>

102
00:04:56,539 --> 00:05:01,940
over time when we obtain a time series

103
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:04,010
and what we what we discover when we do

104
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:09,229
this is many people have alluded to our

105
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:12,169
nanog is a diurnal pattern over time on

106
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:15,560
some interconnections so what we have

107
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:20,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is a graph taken from a point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

108
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">boston in november 2013 the red line is</font>

109
00:05:20,349 --> 00:05:25,909
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt to the near end of the link and</font>

110
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:28,190
the green line is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rtt to the phone</font>

111
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,440
to the link and this is one week and

112
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:33,110
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is that there is a level</font>

113
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:38,000
shift during presumably some amount of a

114
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:41,060
peak time and that on this particular

115
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,039
graph the level shift occurs the

116
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:46,490
duration of that is somewhere between 14

117
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,680
and 16 hours on in this particular graph

118
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:53,659
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on whether it's a weekday or a</font>

119
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,789
weekend as to whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

120
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:58,550
actually causing loss or not then the

121
00:05:55,789 --> 00:06:00,889
graph below it what we what we do is we

122
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:04,039
see in a series of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> not series as</font>

123
00:06:00,889 --> 00:06:06,500
more frequent series of probes to the

124
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:08,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">firing to the router we've seen</font>

125
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,349
essentially one every second for about a

126
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:13,940
week and we measured what the how many

127
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:15,560
peckers we got back and what the what

128
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,990
the pecker drop rate was essentially and

129
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,490
you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the lust has not</font>

130
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:24,000
initially<font color="#E5E5E5"> begin as the wave</font>

131
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:26,250
the level shift occurs but a little bit

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,680
shortly after that and then the loss

133
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,120
rate grows as what we assume is the

134
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">demand on the link increases over time</font>

135
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,830
so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of challenges to</font>

136
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:40,318
this so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know what the</font>

137
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,419
reverse path is that's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to to</font>

138

inferences that we're making<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going</font>

150
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,508
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into using reverse path record</font>

151
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,750
route as a reverse path trace routes

record route<font color="#E5E5E5"> timestamps and demography</font>

153
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,090
and anything else that we can we

154
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,060
confront this problem to strengthen our

155
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,859
our influences another<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we're observing and the network is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

157
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,300
we see for some interconnections many

158
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:30,659
parallel<font color="#CCCCCC"> lengths and some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cases we have</font>

159
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">observed 16 parallel links between two</font>

160
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:37,289
border routers and so the natural

161
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:39,120
question arises is the congestion as

162
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:42,210
this diagonal pattern consistent over

163
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,070
overall length we would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

164
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:48,719
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> brown truth about what happens in</font>

165

practice other challengers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

166
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:51,599
challenge that come to mind is that if

167
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:53,580
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and do this over time the</font>

168
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,680
internet connections themselves come and

169
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,380
go we need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to adapt to router</font>

170
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,000
paths that change<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time we don't</font>

171
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know where the which</font>

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,020
direction the congestion or the loaders

173
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,330
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network but we have some ideas</font>

174
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:08,068
about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> determine that and of</font>

175

course<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the messages that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sending make you differently to from</font>

177
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,270
other traffic so we might be measuring

178
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,219
something other than than traffic but in

179
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of one of the motivating things</font>

180
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:21,120
and I hope nurses are reasonably

181
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,000
compelling picture efforts true is that

182
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,340
we'd like to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to plot over time</font>

183
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
what their condition pattern looks like

184
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,888
on different lengths and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

185
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,510
using historic trace routes that we have

186
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:33,870
from quedas art project that have

187
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:38,279
happened

188
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:43,679
across three lengths from an unnamed

00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:47,010
access network for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past year and so</font>

00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wax is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is is how long</font>

191
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the level shift is when we infer that</font>

192
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,420
there are some congestion so in its

193
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">counted in hours so the start of last</font>

194
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:00,420
year the red dot sort of picked up at

195
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:02,220
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> about maybe five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours and there</font>

196
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,319
was also some blue there around about

197
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,210
five hours a day that the link seem to

198
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,190
be reasonably congested but then there

199
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:12,240
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decline in the blue and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

200
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,910
replaced with new condition that wasn't

201
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,460
observed before that on the green link

202
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:20,390
and the net one was taken away<font color="#CCCCCC"> for about</font>

203
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:23,970
after about two months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we see</font>

204
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:29,010
now a much higher presented load on the

205
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:31,710
a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a return on the be linked but</font>

206
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:34,400
the general pattern on for the red one

207
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:37,020
is of course it's gone from around about

208
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:41,189
somewhere between for four hours a day

209
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:46,170
to now seems to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Podesta door full for</font>

210
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:48,450
up to 16<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours of the of the day so our</font>

211
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,490
end goal is to have some lightweight and

212
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:52,050
easily deployed method to view

213
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,610
individual link congestion patterns the

214
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,250
reason why we're focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this rather</font>

215
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:58,140
than doing throughput<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that if we want</font>

yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> jump up to Mike</font>

232
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:54,229
can you tell us a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

233
00:10:50,629 --> 00:11:00,049
the when you do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rtt measurements</font>

234
00:10:54,229 --> 00:11:02,319
right you tell us<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the size of the</font>

235
00:11:00,049 --> 00:11:04,519
selection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of packet sizes that we do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear about</font>

237
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sure the packet sizes we're using a</font>

238
00:11:07,609 --> 00:11:14,419
small packets so just your regular

239
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:16,189
traceroute size 50 60 byte packets so

240
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:20,869
that's small packets so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> sending</font>

241
00:11:16,189 --> 00:11:22,848
small packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> not large ones Don balm</font>

242
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:25,219
and stand by answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> two questions did</font>

243
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:27,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look at using ecn as a signal like</font>

244
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:29,869
maybe getting those bits back and the

245
00:11:27,379 --> 00:11:31,669
second is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font>

246
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:34,819
technique one of the problems that i ran

247
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:37,459
into when I tried it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the you know</font>

248
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:40,368
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traceroute you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know the the</font>

249
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:42,018
ICMP you know TTL exceeded it seemed to

250
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:44,449
also be correlated to cpu load on the

251
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:46,629
router so as I got busier you sometimes

252
00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:49,069
got both the congestion effect and the

253
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,269
something else did you look at that or

254
00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:53,868
do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's significant for</font>

255
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:56,029
these types of routers yes so on so on

256
00:11:53,869 --> 00:11:58,039
this particular graph we see some and

257
00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:01,059
both the red and the green some<font color="#E5E5E5"> spike</font>

258
00:11:58,039 --> 00:12:03,949
that we assume I guess is that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

259
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:06,709
contention for some may be rather cpu

260
00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:09,139
usage in terms of whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not this is</font>

261
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:11,449
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> material impact what we're looking at</font>

262
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:13,129
is the minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> our duties</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we over and a</font>

263
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:16,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular bucket over time so we think</font>

264
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:19,399
if we take the minimum then we are

265
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:21,979
avoiding<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of these unknowns about how</font>

266
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,779
long we waited in the cpu<font color="#E5E5E5"> for did you</font>

267
00:12:21,979 --> 00:12:25,459
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the use of ecn as a pot lake</font>

268
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:27,049
young<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there might be an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

269
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,118
one to see if you could figure out a way

270
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:31,039
to use both<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ecn and the TTL to get</font>

271
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:37,149
that router and only that router to say

272
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:37,149
it's busy yeah maybe thank you

273
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:45,800
perfect well our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is Chris</font>

274
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:52,520
talking about operators and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF so</font>

275
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:55,310
I'll let<font color="#E5E5E5"> him take that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away good</font>

276
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:56,540
afternoon yes I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you a</font>

277
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit about a new project that we</font>

were<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling operators and the IETF</font>

280
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,670
first I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just kind of introduce</font>

281
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,339
who we are within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet society</font>

282
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:09,110
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small team of us myself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Daniel</font>

283
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,260
work Megan Cruz and yawns<font color="#CCCCCC"> ors they're</font>

284
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:14,240
all from left to right that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

285
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:15,529
on operational issues and deployment

issues from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet society</font>

287
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:18,830
perspective so a big part of what we're

288
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:21,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do is get you all to talk to</font>

289
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,190
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other more and also to provide</font>

290
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,930
information and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dis still</font>

291
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:26,000
information from first adopters of

292
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,069
technologies down too fast followers as

293
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,930
well as facilitate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC a few work</font>

294
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:32,480
that's going on in many regions and a

295
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:35,680
couple of other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things among them now is</font>

296
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,200
this operators in the IETF project so

297
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,160
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the stems from is we have</font>

298
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this dream</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a perfect world</font>

299
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,329
potentially where operators actually

300
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,680
know what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ITF enough</font>

301
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:48,050
to provide input win and where it's

302
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:51,620
needed right so that all protocols come

303
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:52,849
out fully baked and in you know full

304
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:54,440
consciousness of operational realities

305
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,180
so the protocols actually work<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

306
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,680
real world and the real world reflected

307
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,959
in new protocols and new standards that

308
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,219
are being developed so that operators

309
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,700
know when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> step in and</font>

310
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,810
provide input and and do that the

311
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,640
problem is that today that's that's not

312
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:08,719
happening to the scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we'd like to</font>

313
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,610
see it right there are operators who

314
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,170
participate in the ITF but<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font>

315
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,420
enough based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the feedback that I've</font>

316
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,800
heard in the years that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been going</font>

317
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">to meetings</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and things a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

318
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,469
operators feel that there's not enough

319
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:20,180
operator input in the ITF and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

320
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:22,550
operators you know don't participate in

321
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">the IETF for one reason or another which</font>

322
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:26,270
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're left with researchers</font>

323
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,040
academics vendors creating all of the

324
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:29,870
standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> that then we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go deploy</font>

325
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,370
or you have to go deploy in the real

326
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,990
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always sync up</font>

327
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:37,700
properly because you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always</font>

328
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,529
talking so the plan is to facilitate

329
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,970
increased operator and put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF</font>

330
00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,140
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want you know</font>

331
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,000
all operators that show up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at nog</font>

332
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:45,290
meetings to show up at the ITF or you

333
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,300
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> waste all your time you know</font>

334
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,339
following IETF<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time but we</font>

335
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,969
would like you to be able to provide

336
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:52,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">input</font>

337
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,370
where it's needed again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

338
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,439
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is I'm here I'm talking to</font>

339
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,480
you and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to get information</font>

340
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:01,879
from you on why you do or do not

341
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,240
participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF and your</font>

342
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:07,029
thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on how we could increase the</font>

343
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation between the IETF and</font>

344
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:12,410
operators so we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we're going</font>

345
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">to cut we have a survey out we're going</font>

346
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:17,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to listen travel the world talk to</font>

347
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:19,189
people try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of really define</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

348
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,359
problem space and understand what all

349
00:15:19,189 --> 00:15:22,910
the problems I would all the pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

350
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,379
parts are and then towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> the later</font>

351
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,839
part of the year will analyze all those

352
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:28,250
results obviously come back again make

353
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,139
sure that we understood what you said Oh

354
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">present there is you know present what</font>

355
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,970
you've told us back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and then</font>

356
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">hopefully from that formulate some plans</font>

357
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,529
for actual changes that could be made to

358
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,910
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process better right and I</font>

359
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">think those those changes probably gonna</font>

360
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:44,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">fall into three categories</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

361
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:45,829
there's there's one side which is things

362
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:48,410
that that the operators and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operator</font>

363
00:15:45,829 --> 00:15:50,000
groups can do to help this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work better</font>

364
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,009
there's gonna be another bucket of

365
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,180
things that the ITF would need to do to

366
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">make things better and there's going to</font>

367
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,029
be hopefully a bucket in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle also</font>

368
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,559
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> theatre in a society that my team or</font>

369
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:59,779
others i work with can do to help

370
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:01,579
facilitate<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again we won't</font>

371
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:03,709
really know all of those solutions until

372
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:05,959
we can really define the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem which</font>

373
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,518
<font color="#CCCCCC">is where i'm here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to you to tell</font>

374
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,829
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this opportunity would really</font>

375
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,420
like you to fill out this online survey

376
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:14,329
and also come find me in the hallways

377
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,279
and talk to me about the ITF how what

378
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:18,559
you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current process why</font>

379
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:20,509
you feel your input<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know welcome</font>

380
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:23,029
not welcome or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just can't get there</font>

381
00:16:20,509 --> 00:16:24,379
to give it so now there's a survey link

382
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:26,540
here I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up for a</font>

383
00:16:24,379 --> 00:16:28,250
little bit um also I believe john curran

384
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,110
forwarded an email to the nanog list

385
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,329
about this survey also when we first

386
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,470
launched the project so and i'll send

387
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:35,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">this out again to the nana I've been in</font>

388
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">list after this talk but we'd really</font>

389
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">love to hear for you it shouldn't take</font>

390
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,949
very long it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick little survey</font>

391
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:41,719
just gathering some quick information on

392
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:43,878
your level of participation and level of

393
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,839
awareness of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF and so even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

394
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:46,339
it's something where you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

395
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:47,360
you've never participated the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF you</font>

396
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,069
have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what's going on there</font>

397
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,809
you're exactly who we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this</font>

398
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:52,189
survey we'd like to you know understand

399
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,740
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> better what your perception</font>

400
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:55,910
is and why are why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you know the</font>

401
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,579
things are don't know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you do</font>

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:00,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the IETF I'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

403
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:02,829
questions but really I just like you to

404
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">take the survey</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">way I know of right no we plan on</font>

412
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,290
talking to many people at the IETF so

413

still working that out exactly where all

417
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,300
that communication needs to happen i

418
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:42,290
will be talking the UN london i'll be

419
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,260
talking to people and seeing where we

420
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:48,409
know where we can get this input into

421
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,640
and you know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to synergize that so we</font>

422
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely will take this message to the</font>

423
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,990
IETF and basically will go to the ITF

424
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,990
leadership and trickle down from there

425
00:18:00,269 --> 00:18:04,210
