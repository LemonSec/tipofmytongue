1
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,780
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> afternoon everyone</font>

2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,180
so today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will be talking about</font>

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:20,419
spammers performing<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP hijacks to send</font>

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,770
spam and remains and remain stealthy and

5
00:00:20,419 --> 00:00:24,449
about the tool called spam<font color="#E5E5E5"> tray so that</font>

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:28,590
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have developed to track those</font>

7
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:31,380
spammers so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just quick this type</font>

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,019
with a brief introduction so BGP

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,850
hijacking is caused by the injection<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

10
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,969
erroneous routing information into v GP

11
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:42,090
and this is possible because while there

12
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,329
is still no widely deployed security

13
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,460
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prevent this the effect of</font>

14
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:49,440
BGP hijacking is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an either a black hole</font>

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,010
of the victim network or the hijacker

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,170
can act as a metal middle so we also

17
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,960
know that BGP hijacking incidents occur

18
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,329
regularly in the internet but those

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,269
incidents while most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them can be</font>

20
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,940
attributed to rather miss configuration

21
00:01:03,269 --> 00:01:08,070
not on operational fault like the most

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">famous one is probably the hijack of</font>

23
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,839
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of YouTube network by Pakistan</font>

24
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,280
telegram but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> many others what</font>

25
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,370
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in in our case is</font>

26
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,440
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach be hijacked also performed</font>

27
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:25,140
in preparation of other malicious

28
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:27,960
activities like spam so this work

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,550
started with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conjecture the</font>

30
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,250
conjecture is that spammers would use

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,880
BGP hijacking to send spam from<font color="#E5E5E5"> stolen</font>

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:38,310
IP space and remain stealthy so this

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,220
phenomena was really introduced a few

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago in a research paper which</font>

35
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,080
describe short-lived routes this lasting

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:49,910
less than a day to announce IP space

37
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:53,789
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the work related with a spam</font>

38
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:57,060
but in fact while such phenomena does

39
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,620
not necessarily imply hijacks and they

40
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,060
also an internal reports on mailing

41
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">lists like monster hog and spammers</font>

42
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:10,190
behaved really behave this way this

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:12,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have really serious effects first</font>

44
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:15,060
it can lead to miss tributing attacks

45
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:17,940
lounge from hijacked networks due to I

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,069
Jack<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stealing IP identity and second</font>

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,359
spam<font color="#CCCCCC"> filters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still heavily without an IP</font>

48
00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:22,950
reputation as the first layer of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Defense</font>

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,400
so this would have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact on</font>

50
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:28,649
effectiveness so when we started this

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,379
work we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to answer this</font>

52
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:36,980
question 5 by spammers<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it really a</font>

53
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:41,250
reality or it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just some kind of myth</font>

54
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,768
so the objective of this work was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

55
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,989
to validate to invalidate on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large</font>

56
00:02:43,769 --> 00:02:49,260
scale this conjecture about fly by

57
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:50,610
spammers and if its internal to be real

58
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,459
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has the prevalence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

59
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,500
phenomena so to do that we have

60
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> compound tracer which</font>

61
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,980
basically collects<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing information</font>

62
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,540
baseband networks from which we then

63
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:10,290
extract some abnormal writing behaviors

64
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:12,269
and then try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pgp hijacks so</font>

65
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,679
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> assumption the harness boundary so</font>

66
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:16,140
is that when an IP address block is

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,220
hijacked for stealthy spamming routing

68
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,109
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> observed when the block is</font>

69
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,500
released by the spammer to remain

70
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,569
stealthy and so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we do is</font>

71
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,670
because I bgp routes and IPS<font color="#E5E5E5"> reg well to</font>

72
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,530
which span networks just after spam is

73
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,230
received and then look for routing

74
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,910
change from the hijack state of the

75
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,209
network the network to the normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

76
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:39,239
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is the system</font>

77
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:41,190
architecture it's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> input</font>

78
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,519
to spam tracer is just a live feed of

79
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:46,290
spam received as<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle class spam traps</font>

80
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,690
from which way to act sponsored IP

81
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,910
addresses when we see an IP address from

82
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:53,280
a bug on IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> block consider this</font>

83
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:57,900
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course very suspicious so we monitor</font>

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,980
it then each panel network is monitored

85
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:05,069
for one week after spam is received and

86
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:07,738
so we collect bgp routes and IPS fresh

87
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:11,608
routes the IPTS mapping is<font color="#CCCCCC"> perform</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

88
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,040
live BTW bgp fits then we expect a bunch

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:18,090
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp and treasure island</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Amelie's that</font>

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,760
we further use to detect hijackings so

91
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:23,340
detailed analysis of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected</font>

92
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:25,500
between Jerry and July 2013 led to the

93
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,400
identification of 29 hijacked IP address

94
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:31,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">blocks as you can see the hijacks the</font>

97
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,940
and from the different address blocks

98
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,680
hijacked we extracted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the following</font>

has<font color="#E5E5E5"> already has already been described</font>

109
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:11,410

110
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,940
all hijacks match this signature so

111
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,150
furthermore in practice we observed

<font color="#CCCCCC">that most hijacked IP prefixes were left</font>

short-lived nature of hijacks then

154
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:29,758
furthermore when spammer wants to use I

169
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:11,860
also suggests that the spammers that we

which means that spammers never<font color="#CCCCCC"> hijack</font>

188
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:01,639
to same IP prefix twice so from all

189
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:03,199
these observations we can conclude that

00:09:08,899 --> 00:09:13,910
looked at the networks that were

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> south very likely out of business</font>

199
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,940
while the remaining 17 were found to be

200
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:34,160
still in business and so from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we</font>

201
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:36,880
can say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> firebase members seem to</font>

202
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,810
simply target dormant IP address block

203
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,209
regardless of their owner still being in

204
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:46,250
business or not now quite interestingly

205
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,949
we observed several hijacks being

206
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,600
performed in groups of two to four all

207
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:54,229
hijacks in a group studying and adding

208
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:57,980
and ending at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time during</font>

209
00:09:54,230 --> 00:10:02,060
several days they were also always<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

210
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">least two IP prefixes hijacked and we</font>

211
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:06,410
believe from this temporal pattern that

212
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:09,769
those hijacks actually have a common

213
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,819
good cause so now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how this</font>

214
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:16,690
temporal I don't looks like on a

215
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:22,189
timeline can see it's quite interesting

216
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:24,730
so spam tracer was build upon the

217
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:28,790
assumption that fly by spammers perform

218
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:31,220
short-lived hijacks and with us look

219
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:32,779
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> for such hijacks this is</font>

229
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:05,930

against these fly by spammers well in

245
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,800
the observed hijack cases we've seen

246
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,540
that spammers do not tamper with the

247

<font color="#E5E5E5">originals of the IP address block making</font>

252
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:14,019
so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a system framework meant to</font>

which has been in development for many

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,680
years now and probably the most

256
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,800
promising solution for now aims at

257
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,510
preventing any type of hijack via secure

258
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,420
webs origination and secure web

263
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:41,540
stage so there's basically no way

00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:44,149
currently to prevent fly by spamming

265

hijacks just prevent any trace back so

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:57,160
completely defeat this effort now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few</font>

290
00:13:54,010 --> 00:14:00,250
words on the perspectives while we would

291
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,439
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide an interface for network</font>

292
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:06,160
operators to query identifying hijacks

293
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,530
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a while they would</font>

294
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">be interested in that we would also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

295
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:13,480
to actually collaborate with writing in

296
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:15,880
debt registries and also internet

297
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,680
service providers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help mitigate those</font>

298
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:23,650
hijacks because these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones who</font>

299
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,599
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the means to do that and that</font>

300
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,760
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ongoing collaboration</font>

301
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,140
with a French<font color="#E5E5E5"> Research Institute and a</font>

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,569

illegitimate QA sorry illegitimate a

311
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:03,600
esas up streams were mostly what you saw

312
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,880
what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that specifically</font>

313
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,750
specifically are you referring to a

314
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:13,370
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> light yeah no no closer to the</font>

315
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">end no no it's weird the end again uh</font>

316
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:18,330
just just a few from the end

317
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:24,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">illegitimate up streams is what is what</font>

318
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:28,200
I was asking about know that they're

319
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:31,320
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegitimate yeah just like could</font>

320
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,930
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be clear how we found the DS</font>

321
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:37,910
way legitimate yeah and and would you

322
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:40,709
know is it a case where / prefix

323
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:47,610
filtering with inbound would've helped

324
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:49,890
or not so first we we found that they

325
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:54,120
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegitimate for different reasons</font>

326
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:55,949
like they were not used for as extremely

327
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,650
Isis for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other non hijacked IP</font>

328
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:01,830
address book at a time some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

329
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:07,579
reported for example by<font color="#CCCCCC"> spamhaus as</font>

330
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:11,010
being involved in in hijacks these<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

331
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,630
these autonomous systems also referred

332
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:15,209
to organizations that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> also solved</font>

333
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:18,240
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were not supposed to be used</font>

334
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:19,920
anymore and different features I<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

335
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,800
and for the second part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your question</font>

336
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:26,160
I didn't so what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a prefix</font>

337
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,630
filtering I know you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I was</font>

338
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,699
wondering a prefix filtering would have

339
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:32,160
helped I mean so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

340
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:34,830
carrier of some legitimate standing at

341
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,829
some point is turning up an adjacency to

342
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,839
an AAS that's of ill repute and

343
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,270
accepting anything from them is that

344
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,680
yeah basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah what we believe is</font>

345
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,220
it either they

346
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:51,729
while the hijackers memories found

347
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,370
colluding<font color="#CCCCCC"> I speak to appear with or that</font>

348
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:58,810
simply they<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage to advertise those</font>

349
00:16:54,370 --> 00:17:02,410
previous 2 some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs which actually</font>

350
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:10,000
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care about what their</font>

351
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:12,909
customers advertise so yeah you and then

352
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,920
the rear<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike hi Doug Montgomery nest it</font>

353
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,309
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to me whether you're only</font>

354
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,420
looking for hijacks in dormant space or

355
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:22,389
you're saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're looking across</font>

356
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:26,079
all space and only seen no we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

357
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:30,880
look for any type of hijack but we are

358
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,580
actually only found very well I'd say

359
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:37,450
very suspicious malicious cases

360
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:41,500
involving dormant IP address blocks hi

361
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:44,110
TJ often so you mentioned collaborating

362
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:46,950
with our ers and ISPs what about

363
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing a signal to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our BLS about</font>

364
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,510
address space which has been dormant or

365
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,490
as being advertised by a new a s for

366
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:56,379
some period of time so I as an MTA

367
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:59,470
operator can decide I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

368
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,350
accept mail from an address block which

369
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:08,380
has freshly been advertised by na s this

370
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:12,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">is another yeah this is another option</font>

371
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:16,990
yeah I just well I just thought about

372
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:23,890
rears and a nice piece because while

373
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:27,600
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an obvious well role in while</font>

374
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:31,570
managing and also effectively while

375
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:36,760
routing IP resources so but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true</font>

376
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:39,550
that I mean any mean to prevent those

377
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:42,879
prefixes from from actually being used

378
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:44,110
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good and should be yeah I mean</font>

379
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,850
not necessarily to prevent them from

380
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:47,979
being used but to give that option so

381
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,330
programmatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could say I don't</font>

382
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,790
want to accept mail from yeah yeah

383
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,059
that's that's new yeah you all right

384
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,059
thing

385
00:18:54,380 --> 00:19:02,220
Jeff Houston<font color="#CCCCCC"> obsessive compulsive when I</font>

386
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:05,400
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this myself I was looking at</font>

387
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:08,100
the amount of time the prefix had been

388
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,710
dormant before it reappeared and hoping

389
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,500
there was some kind of signature in the

390
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:16,800
dormant interval did you find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

391
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:19,380
spammers prefer to reuse a space almost

392
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately after it's been withdrawn or</font>

393
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,660
do they wait for day a week a month or

394
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:27,600
it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> random did you look at the</font>

395
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">doorman interval well we looked at the</font>

396
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:37,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">doorman interval and it's a it's</font>

397
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:40,320
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yep this so what we've</font>

398
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:43,678
seen is that most IP prefixes were left

399
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,939
dormant for quite a long time it's it's

400
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,740
I mean mostly more than a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font>

401
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,790
takes well this gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> farmers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a</font>

402
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:56,790
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time to just found them I mean</font>

403
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:59,159
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily they don't</font>

404
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,790
basically targets prefixes which have

405
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,410
just disappeared<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the routing tables</font>

406
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,690
if you if you wanted to tie this to the

407
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:10,020
previous question<font color="#E5E5E5"> about feeding into our</font>

408
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:17,850
BLS yeah is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of distribution of</font>

409
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:25,530
strong clue did this this this might be

410
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:29,240
one of the feature but well of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

411
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:34,110
might be included I mean it might be a

412
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:39,360
part of like system or criteria to

413
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:41,370
consider a prefixes while suspicious but

414
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">it should of course not be the only one</font>

415
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:45,330
because there are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases were of</font>

416
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,950
course like that i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the minimum is</font>

417
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:54,149
just one month so it can be used<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

418
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,800
it's it's also not well not another

419
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:58,610
that's just a single feature of course

420
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,610
thanks

421
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:07,190
other questions no further<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

422
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,190
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much</font>
