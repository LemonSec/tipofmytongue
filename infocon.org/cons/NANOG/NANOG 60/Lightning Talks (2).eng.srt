00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,009
Hargrove will

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,920
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone my name is will holla if I'm</font>

7
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,780
a technical director for Lana which is a

<font color="#CCCCCC">midsize internet exchange in london UK</font>

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,399
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is a</font>

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,920
technique we've developed that reduces

11
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,379
the impact of maintenance that<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IXP</font>

12
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,329
operator does are on the internet

13
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,620
basically so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

14
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:55,370
with simple stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of silly</font>

15
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,479
i'm aiming a presentation and I

16
00:00:55,370 --> 00:01:00,659
experience and explaining what<font color="#CCCCCC"> an IXPs</font>

17
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,860
but stay with me going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this and so</font>

18
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:03,930
what is an internet changes to switch

19
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,400
fabric for interconnected networks bgp

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,549
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the control plane and</font>

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,710
which is how the Reuters that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

22
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,930
connected to win they signal reach

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,839
ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear them so what actually</font>

24
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,610
happens to the production traffic on the

25
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,290
internet exchange when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ixp operated</font>

26
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,210
does and maintenance is a typical

27
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,520
internet exchange you've got your to

28
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">Reuters at the bottom there which is you</font>

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,240
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ice peas or other networks</font>

30
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,530
and then we have a bunch of switches at

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,240
the top and we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP session</font>

32
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,670
between them all stuff you know simple

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,960
stuff so I'm going to I'm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IT</font>

34
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,020
operator I need to do a software upgrade

35
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:42,119
on the box I so I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> some stomp on that</font>

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">switch on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand side so what</font>

37
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:47,429
stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> do in now well the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> root is there</font>

38
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:49,109
there there are sitting there with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

39
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:50,999
whole time is running they're still

40
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,380
sending traffic trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send traffic</font>

41
00:01:50,999 --> 00:01:53,729
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet exchange and all the</font>

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,020
packets<font color="#CCCCCC"> are leaking out onto the floor</font>

43
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,158
and this is all your users data and it's

44
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,969
being dropped and their sickness

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,609
thinking of all where's my peer and the

46
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,889
time is running so then 30 to 180

47
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:09,000
seconds later the whole timer expires at

48
00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:10,470
their tongues aspire and they tear down

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,810
the bgp sessions they move the traffic

50
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,430
to a different route that sucks right

51
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is not a great way to run an</font>

52
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,990
internet so how can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve this</font>

53
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,160
experience well what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said it causes</font>

54
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,209
some black holding so we're doing it

55
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually wrong way around let's think</font>

56
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,569
about an ideal way of doing this at the

57
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,430
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the maintenance window we tear</font>

58
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:28,260
down the control plane we wait for the

59
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,440
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go away and then we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

60
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,630
maintenance<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the problem is is I</font>

61
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,240
don't have log install on 140<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus</font>

62
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,670
member Reuters and neither is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

63
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,950
good idea and but what we can do is we

64
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,069
can put layer for acls on the exchange

65
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,048
operators edge ports

66
00:02:43,069 --> 00:02:46,999
blocking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP at the start of the</font>

67
00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:49,909
maintenance<font color="#E5E5E5"> window here's a sample ACL</font>

68
00:02:46,999 --> 00:02:54,109
so I'm looking say from source address

69
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:56,480
of my XP subnet<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP 179 ibgp you need to</font>

70
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:57,859
block<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in both directions otherwise</font>

71
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,540
the sessions will reestablish in the

72
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:03,319
other direction because<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP can work</font>

73
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:07,358
either way and you obviously need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

74
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:09,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 as well so we tested this</font>

75
00:03:07,359 --> 00:03:11,090
tested this during several on that

76
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,358
maintenance I except<font color="#E5E5E5"> also studied using</font>

77
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,700
this technique traffic typically goes

78
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:18,620
away in a few minutes and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage</font>

79
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,810
being that you remove the ACL when

80
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:22,579
you're actually ready so sometimes the

81
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,989
upgrade screws up like you forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

82
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,189
change the boot variable and you reboot

83
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:27,129
to the box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it came up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the same</font>

84
00:03:25,189 --> 00:03:29,810
software we've all<font color="#E5E5E5"> done stuff like that</font>

85
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:31,578
in this particular case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you can</font>

86
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:35,870
then restore the traffic when you when

87
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:37,549
you're actually ready and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

88
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,859
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty simple technique</font>

89
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:43,519
everyone everyone's I spoken<font color="#CCCCCC"> to has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

90
00:03:39,859 --> 00:03:47,359
pretty interested in it doesn't seem<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

91
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,370
have any bad effects and makes a better

92
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:51,379
internet and so we're thinking about

93
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:54,169
maybe making a document<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some sort</font>

94
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:57,819
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to explain it and that's</font>

95
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:57,819
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really for me any questions</font>

96
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,720
stunned silence Scott Scott librarian

97
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,900
limelight oh hi Scott I saw this

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,149
presentation in Europe somewhere some

99
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:18,160
months ago he's anyone else doing it

100
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:20,019
since then yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started doing it</font>

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,870
and I thought while I was here at nano I

102
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,430
would maybe explain it to Minton

103
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,130
exchanges in this room and see whether

104
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,650
see whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I'm also interested in</font>

105
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,260
network standing up and maybe shouting

106
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,760
at me for live I elations or messing

107
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:40,810
with their bgp or any of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

108
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:42,580
things so um thanks so yeah actually I

109
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,440
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> helpful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

110
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,820
it has the ability to remove the control

111
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,740
path before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data path goes away</font>

112
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,020
which of course is critical to Wyatt

113
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,030
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help take traffic away from the</font>

114
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,960
exchanges more gracefully this is

115
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,909
actually something we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing for</font>

116
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,909
some time I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our own routers</font>

117
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:59,710
as a convenient way to terminate b QP

118
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,570
sessions during maintenance periods too

119
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,150
so it's it's actually glad to see that

120
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:07,810
this is getting a new application on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

121
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,460
layer to side yes so do you do that

122
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,460
because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just easier than minute</font>

123
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:15,039
then doing alternative HP convict yeah

124
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,780
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we take entire nodes out of</font>

125
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:20,350
service because it's easier to just

126
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,320
filter all of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and it allows us</font>

127
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">to control like individual links without</font>

128
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,940
having to associate to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer of</font>

129
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:29,890
three yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usually get comments</font>

130
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,240
like well why don't the members turn

131
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,340
down their bgp sessions during the

132
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,750
maintenance window but I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

133
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,429
know that no one actually ever bothers

134
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,660
to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintence notifications and they</font>

135
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,630
just like wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> until they happen and</font>

136
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,900
phone up the knock or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway</font>

137
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,250
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks well I'll echo both you</font>

138
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,150
and Mike I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a great idea</font>

139
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,530
and

140
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,020
answer that yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to</font>

141
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:53,619
propose it as a PCO p you can do it in

142
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Equinix actually uh Eric rosenberry from</font>

143
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,580
n wax I was going to make the exact same

145
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,810
finished our last migration from

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,120
the new legal entity which we're talking

150
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,710
about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit later and we had to</font>

151
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,390
move 50 members and it was a pain

152
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,010
because I mean at first we gave

153
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,750
everybody several windows like hey you

154
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">know call into a bridge this time I shot</font>

155
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:19,810
your sessions down and check light

levels you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we'll run ping tests and</font>

157
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,170
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring them back up and</font>

158
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,429
then the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> window is like hey we're</font>

159
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:26,050
moving you whether or not you do

160
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,000
coordination or not and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> royal</font>

161
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,080
pain in the butt I love the solution and

162
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,280
thanks for presenting this you should

163
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:33,280
definitely write it up and get it on the

164
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:36,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet thanks very much thanks welcome</font>

use a sandal can Eternals consultancy um

167
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,950
you mentioned about layer layer

168
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,990
violations and I know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think links</font>

169
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have legal advice not to do layer</font>

170
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,030
violations um is the idea saying

171
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,310
basically doing the best practice is

172
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,309
that to deal with the specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

173
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,110
there such as not basically r only

174
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,360
interfering with the signaling data and

175
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,460
not the user data yes am innocent

176
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,750
interesting point and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think some of</font>

177
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,460
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh we don't want to admit that</font>

178
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can do filtering on internet exchange</font>

179
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:12,180
but I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in this room knows</font>

180
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:15,070
we can one interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> things is that um</font>

181
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,930
we're actually blocking traffic to and

182
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,690
from our IP addresses the internet

183
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,790
exchanges IP addresses right it's kind

184
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:24,400
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of greens is rather</font>

185
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:28,600
different to blocking arbitrary internet

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,799
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks well I just thought worth</font>

187
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:32,190
pointing that out yeah great thanks

stage

193
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:11,890
so I don't just study routing I also

194
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">study dns and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm glad to follow the guy</font>

195
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,539
from far sight because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this their</font>

196
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,940
data this is a big passive DNS source

197
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,130
called the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet exchange</font>

198
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,960
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I studied and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to run</font>

199
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,700
across this and thought you know it's

200
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,859
really important so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the</font>

201
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,020
lovely legalese everyone enjoy the

202
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:32,500
legalese that is the downside of

203
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">legalese means that i can tell you if</font>

204
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,460
you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me directly if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're affected</font>

205
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,890
by what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about but i</font>

206
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:43,600
can't announce who's affected by it from

207
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:48,100
the stage so this is weirdness<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font>

208
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:49,780
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS I because like with the routing I</font>

209
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,150
studying i did i'm sitting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

210
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:55,959
outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking in I don't know what</font>

211
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:58,600
causes it but I do know what if the IP

212
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,940
address you're sending email to as an MX

213
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,160
server is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually the IP address to</font>

214
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:07,210
the mx-server you think you're sending

215
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:13,390
it to this isn't theory this is actually

216
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:16,300
occurring right now what I see I found

217
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:19,270
in the security internet exchange I see

218
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:23,229
the response i pee that gives back the

219
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:25,300
response to the queer now some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

220
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,100
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite valid nameservers some of</font>

221
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,729
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys just oh hi I'm a name</font>

222
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:35,710
server today and what they're responding

223
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:38,110
back for let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it fubar com is it</font>

224
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:41,520
surprised a different IP address than it

225
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:45,490
should well yeah that's a CDN duh

226
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:48,610
however um i filtered those out in this

227
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:52,630
still going what's left of the bad stuff

228
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:54,880
and it's mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of shared hosting so</font>

229
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,890
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know what's causing this I</font>

230
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,200
don't know if these are name servers

231
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:00,580
that have bad name server IP addresses

232
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,800
that they're sending their queries to I

233
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know if it's as clients one of the</font>

234
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">things about the security internet</font>

235
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,830
exchange is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> filters out personal</font>

236
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,660
identifying information I don't know who

237
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:14,620
making these queries I just know the

238
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:16,660
response i know that the TTL<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to</font>

239
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,690
be exceeded any long so when you think

240
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're sending your email</font>

241
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,460
foobar com2 it's lovely mx-server and

242
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,050
you've got the event IP address you've

243
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:31,510
got it for a week so what to do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

244
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:35,650
that that's a lovely thing great thing

245
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:38,330
standard user can't do a thing really I

246
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,770
mean I send email all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time I don't</font>

247
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">pay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attention to what IP address is</font>

248
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:45,439
going to I just kind of send it on

249
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,880
enterprise I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell you exactly if you</font>

250
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,100
subscribe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security internet</font>

251
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,660
exchange how to find it you're not going

252
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,720
to find it within your network you're

253
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,250
not going to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on your nameservers</font>

254
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:01,490
this is happening outside of your

255
00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:02,900
nameservers<font color="#E5E5E5"> houses gone unnoticed you</font>

256
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:06,230
got to have a security internet exchange

257
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:09,650
and have the fun that I did it's it's

258
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">just not something you can find easy you</font>

259
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:13,160
can only really<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that if you're</font>

260
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,780
looking for two different values if you

261
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,219
expect the one by you back get the one

262
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,750
by your back you're happy but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

263
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">two values back hey something's wrong</font>

264
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,860
but you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't find it unless</font>

265
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,609
you're querying the right name servers

266
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,870
and you know yay data sharing because of

267
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:28,430
the security internet exchange that's

268
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:32,390
how i found that and that's big data

269
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:34,250
sharing probable causes you know we've

270
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,960
kicked around any number of reasons to

271
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,220
do this the vulnerability team at cert

272
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,470
is kicking it on any number of reasons

273
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do this I don't know what's causing</font>

274
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,240
it because like I said I'm from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

275
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:46,280
outside looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in and all I see is</font>

276
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,810
these IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in part of the</font>

277
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,240
reason so hard to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> as some of these</font>

278
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,859
IP addresses actually give legitimate

279
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,870
responses back and they're only really

280
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:57,110
targeting certain places to give the bad

281
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,520
IP addresses back but if it's you and

282
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,020
you're an enterprise if you're looking

283
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:05,170
directly and knowing what you're looking

284
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:11,810
for through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> siu you can find it and</font>

285
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:13,310
do any questions like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want</font>

286
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:14,689
to know if you're a compromise you come

287
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,430
ask me directly I can answer that

288
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,190

thing quick side note Alexandra lemon

290
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:26,060
curator labs are you should realize that

opportunity for dns

294
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,950
poisoning because the window between

295
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:40,310

301

muchly coming in next we have Lee Howard

302
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:15,410
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about an ipv6 transition</font>

303
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:17,689
date it'll surprise everybody that I'm

304
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:19,880
back to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 there's this</font>

305
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:21,860
problem the the benefits of ipv6 are

306
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,230
it's a network protocol right so there's

307
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:26,570
there's a network effect problem that

308
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,149
ipv6 isn't especially useful until more

309
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:30,649
people are on ipv6 and the more people

310
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:32,779
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 enabled the more useful it is</font>

311
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:34,880
but we don't all know when everybody

312
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,910
else is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to migrate to ipv6 if only</font>

313
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">we could know when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 would be better</font>

314
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,480
faster cheaper then we could make

315
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,490
rational decisions about when each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

316
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,589
needs to migrate how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we possibly</font>

317

though find out figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out when</font>

318
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:50,959
everybody is but when ipv6 will be

319
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,089
better faster cheaper according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

body of network operators in North

322
00:13:54,829 --> 00:14:00,410
America that we could ask so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

323
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:01,339
to ask right this second I'm doing

324
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,980
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's never been done before</font>

325
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:06,860
as far as I know right this second go to

this URL three questions radio buttons

327

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:17,930
results are you have to do it now

332
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">because I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to shut down the pole</font>

333
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:21,800
in about five minutes so I can lunge the

00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:47,378

because I didn't write them Jared being

a wimp decided to take off early so I'm

going to present for him how nice so if

351
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,200
you've been living under a rock for the

352
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:31,510
past six months there's these things

353
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,840
called NTP servers and they can amplify

354
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:37,450
UDP packets sent to them and they have

355
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,800
really big returns you get graphs that

356
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:40,360
look something like this this is an

357
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,599
actual graph I don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> where he</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">pulled it off but you don't need to know</font>

359
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,050
the scale to tell that this is way

360
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,970
larger<font color="#E5E5E5"> than it should be and it's</font>

361
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:52,000
causing all kinds of problems enough of

under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rockness so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is clearly a</font>

363
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,250
well-understood vulnerability and I I

364
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,420
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you don't know</font>

365
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,800
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if you don't know</font>

366
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,560
anything about ntp attacks and you're

367
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,140
confused by this please raise your hand

368
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay then good so now you know how it</font>

369
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:09,819
works and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jared in case</font>

370
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,839
again you've been living under a rock he

371
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,060
started something called the open

372
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,890
resolver project and this is essentially

373
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,709
a copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now we have the open ntp</font>

374
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,720
project org the methodology is pretty

375
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:23,020
simple he sends a packet to every IP

376
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:26,230
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the internet he asks it for</font>

377
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,210
an NDP response and then he measures not

378
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:31,840
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether he got a response but how</font>

379
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:33,250
big the response was the how big the

380
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,110
response was is actually important

381
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,640
because if you send a you know 100 x

382
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,930
packet you get back a 200<font color="#E5E5E5"> x packet</font>

383
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's bad but if you send 100 byte</font>

384
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:44,589
packet you get back 60 1500 byte packets

385
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:46,599
that's a little bit worse he has made

386
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,090
sure that he's only querying each ntp

387
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:51,370
server once a week so hopefully he's not

388
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:55,030
causing too much havoc on the internet

389
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:56,530
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by testing this so we're going to</font>

390
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,730
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data set that he gathered on</font>

posted already maybe I'm not sure so if

417

you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it in more detail</font>

418
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:15,670
you should get the slides but you'll

419
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:18,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">notice that the pie chart is divided</font>

into three major areas with epi Nick

421

they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're not exactly but you</font>

423
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,250
can tell just by the shape that it's not

424
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:29,620
there's not one that just dominates

425
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,450
everything the tiny little slice of two

426
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:33,310
percent is after Nick so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

427
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:35,140
why he called out lack Nick earlier

428
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,690
saying it had fewer<font color="#CCCCCC"> after nick is</font>

429
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,120
actually the smallest the bar on the far

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,950
left is the important one that's the

431
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,419
United States gives you a pretty visual

432
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,340
representation of how bad we are

433
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,230
compared<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the rest of the world so I</font>

434
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,840
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is pretty topical for nanog</font>

435
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:54,340
to explain to its<font color="#E5E5E5"> members that you guys</font>

436
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:58,030
should fix your<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP servers gotta go to</font>

437
00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,669
ntp project that if i open ntp project

438
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:04,930
org find out what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ntp servers are</font>

439
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:08,020
doing and fix them please so this is by

440
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:09,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">asn as you can see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> korean asn or i</font>

441
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,320
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you can read that but the</font>

442
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,230
far left one is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> korean asn that has</font>

443
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,050
most of the 30,000 in korea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it</font>

444
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes down after that it's it's still</font>

445
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:22,000
pretty bad even the one on the far right

446
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,580
TWC still has hundreds of ntp servers

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,679
that are

448
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:27,199
it's not like three there's actually

449
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:29,750
still a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP servers inside of TWC</font>

450
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,700
the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the far right sorry to call</font>

451
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:36,019
you out at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least you were the one on the</font>

452
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:37,820
far right right TWC so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a graph</font>

453
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:40,399
that's actually i think really important

454
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,809
because this is the worst responders

455
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:47,840
these are the ones that respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

456
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:49,010
most bytes per query here the United

457
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,678
States doesn't look too bad we're in

458
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:55,730
third place in a far third place Russia

459
00:19:51,679 --> 00:20:00,440
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolute worst as you can tell so</font>

460
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:03,559
and then fasthosts dash internet is the

461
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">worst asn all of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs need to be</font>

462
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,678
fixed but these are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones that if you</font>

463
00:20:05,149 --> 00:20:08,209
know anybody here this is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

464
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,679
should talk to them because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

465
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,809
worst place<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will send the most</font>

466
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:17,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic back for the least effort from</font>

467
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:20,570
the botnet top ip's by the number of

468
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">bytes think think about this there's a /</font>

469
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:27,649
16 that is 21 million it's just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

470
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:31,269
something needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fixed here really</font>

471
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">bad a number of unique IP is responding</font>

472
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:37,399
notice it's going down and it's going

473
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:42,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">down rapidly so this is pretty good but</font>

474
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:43,639
it needs to go down faster so some

475
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,899
conclusions sorry this was a little bit

476
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:46,039
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a boring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't write</font>

477
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:48,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the slides but I'll take all the credit</font>

478
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,860
and if you have any blame remember to

479
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:55,789
email jeredy manish ok so the

480
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:57,949
vulnerability is everywhere we don't

481
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:01,669
discriminate but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. does win by</font>

482
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:04,460
the most abusable servers but everywhere

483
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:05,779
has some so even if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> visiting from</font>

484
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,850
another area please look at your

485
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:10,549
interview servers and fix them just like

486
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:12,678
your open name servers just like I don't

487
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">know anything else make sure you're not</font>

488
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,529
a spur<font color="#E5E5E5"> fat will fire the internet is not</font>

489
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:20,570
a fun place when people abuse things

490
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:21,710
when was ntp invented I think 1985 and I

491
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:24,379
was actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this before</font>

492
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:27,529
I came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto stage I was owing I think</font>

493
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:30,289
was 85 and back then every bite was

494
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:33,260
precious and things like a TCP three-way

495
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,980
handshake were a problem so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

496
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:36,510
what they did I had

497
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,309
nothing to do with it obviously is they

498
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:41,429
did what they thought made sense at the

499
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:45,480
time one UDP packet in send a UDP packet

500
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:49,350
back what could<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibly go wrong 30</font>

501
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,210
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> later we're all screaming so think</font>

502
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,360
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fix it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and please don't create</font>

503
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,530
any more like this more important the

504
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,939
second bullet point more important to

505
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:58,350
understand the misuse potential in

506
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,299
addition to the population<font color="#CCCCCC"> at large</font>

507
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:02,219
that's the magnitude graph and that's

508
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:04,530
very important that you that you get

509
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,299
yeah there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTP servers that can</font>

510
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:08,928
be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a 2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times amplifier but some</font>

511
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:11,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be used as a massive amplifier</font>

512
00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:14,880
so we see different results when we

513
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,770
examine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> magnitude obviously it the</font>

514
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,980
nice thing though is that if you keep

515
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,049
your ntp server current the

516
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,760
vulnerabilities been fixed you don't

517
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:29,490
have to do anything just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CB sup</font>

518
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:32,100
and recompile and you're done right

519
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:35,160
shouldn't be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem patch your NTP</font>

520
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,010
servers for point-to-point 7p 26 or

521
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,010
later will not amplify shouldn't be a

522
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,360
problem so there are also configuration

523
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:45,150
fixes if you don't want to upgrade to

524
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">the latest one you should add disable</font>

525
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:50,040
monitor you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do other things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I</font>

526
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:52,919
don't know every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible fix but</font>

527
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:56,370
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are ways in your ntp calm to make</font>

528
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:57,870
sure that you do not amplify and also

529
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,030
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the server never ever</font>

530
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:02,729
responds to loop info or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i/o stats</font>

531
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:04,580
requests do we have any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

532
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:06,929
anybody not get the point that if you

533
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,030
let one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things loose on the</font>

534
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:11,130
internet that everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else will be in</font>

535
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:13,620
trouble it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the definition</font>

536
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,790
of cost shifting I've talked to a lot of

537
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who are like well I don't have</font>

538
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:19,590
time to fix this well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing</font>

539
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:23,990
is you're hurting everyone else and for

540
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:27,480
a society to do that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sustainable</font>

541
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,970
Michael Michael Sinatra<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so one</font>

542
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,620
quick note not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTP servers or</font>

543
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,120
things that obviously run in TP there

544
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:37,379
are lots of things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> netapp filers</font>

545
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,600
and other devices San management planes

546
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:41,240
will often run in TP

547
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,039
and of course juniper routers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> s our</font>

548
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">exes they run it and they leave this</font>

549
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,429
stuff open<font color="#CCCCCC"> by default so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

550
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,559
they allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is make these kinds</font>

551
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:50,179
of queries and they run even if you're

552
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">just running ntp as a client because you</font>

553
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:53,990
actually enable all this stuff when you

554
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:55,669
do that so you have to take action to

555
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:57,919
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that stuff is closed off</font>

556
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:59,179
whether it's a CLS or whether it's you

557
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,010
know upgrading to the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of</font>

558
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,419
genus or whatever you need to do a lot

559
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,660
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will say I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running an</font>

560
00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:07,190
NTP server on this boxes at juniper SRX

561
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:11,539
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> running an NTP</font>

562
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:15,530
server that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem outstanding</font>

563
00:24:11,539 --> 00:24:17,890
point fix them all Phil Rosenthal from

564
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:20,330
is prime I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out another</font>

565
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:24,799
amplifier you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not mention is charged</font>

566
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:27,168
in and that's actually we actually see

567
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,000
more attacks from charging than even ntp

568
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:31,580
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if that's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">unique to us but but in any event there</font>

570
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:37,309

port 19 there's no purpose to it but

576
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:52,909
it's it's something else that you should

00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,789
technically at a time do I have the

00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,620
ability to take one more question or not

580

one more<font color="#E5E5E5"> question last question please</font>

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">just NDP like we're gonna get this</font>

584
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,690
mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed and then they're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

585
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,669
move on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> something else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

586
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,650

588
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:21,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">on isp and user down works you're going</font>

589
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:26,000
to see these routers with responding to

590
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:27,799
SNMP so you yes so we all need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font>

591
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">out a way to secure these ancient</font>

592
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,870
protocols that have no security in them

593
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:34,820
yeah they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all ancient SNMP v3 is</font>

594
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,020
pretty new it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much UDP that's</font>

595
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:38,539
the problem because then you don't need

596
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:40,908
a three-way handshake right so you can

597
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:45,080
spoof the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source address so bz p38</font>

598
00:25:40,909 --> 00:25:46,909
secure all your UDP services and if you

599
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,000
don't we'll find you and kill you thank

600

from curator labs we are moscow-based

606
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:40,330
company and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some point of time we</font>

607
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:43,060
needed a tool for our network that could

608
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:46,510
predict ingress traffic distribution so

609
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:48,940
we can balance it better so we decided

610
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:52,240
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is some good words in the</font>

611
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,790
field<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a Qaeda project and we will</font>

612
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,720
just use them what we found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> later</font>

613
00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:03,399
that most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this project they usually</font>

614
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:07,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">use area that data or bgp data and</font>

615
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:11,290
recreate as<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths and connectivity but</font>

616
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:14,140
what was missing is lesser priorities

617
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:16,690
like a local<font color="#CCCCCC"> prep so you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not get</font>

618
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:20,080
reliable tragic prediction from this

619
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:23,580
data there were no<font color="#E5E5E5"> use for us so we</font>

620
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:27,550
decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> create something more and</font>

621
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:30,490
improved on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that introducing active</font>

622
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:35,770
purification in the process so initially

623
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:38,020
we take bgp station data and the GPU

624
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:41,470
data from different sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

625
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:43,900
earlier data and approximate our first

626
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:46,660
doing first approximation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

627
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:48,550
interconnection graph and then we go

628
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:53,050
through the multiple stages of active

629
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:55,360
verification and since it's like in talk

630
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:59,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">i couldn't describe all of them the post</font>

631
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:03,699
simple and useful of them is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

632
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:11,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">a packet to the destination autonomous</font>

633
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:13,420
system with route record flag so if our

634
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:18,030
model is right we will receive this

635
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:22,990
packet on the node word that our model

636
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:28,450
predicts and if we're wrong we will just

637
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:31,360
adjust our routing policies and adjust

638
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:33,580
the model and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will get it</font>

639
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font>

640
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:41,330
meaning that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could actually do</font>

641
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:44,620
recover such things as local<font color="#E5E5E5"> pre f and m</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">ed and other lesser priorities that have</font>

643
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:51,860
taken place in BGP<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision-making</font>

644
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:54,200
process so at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time we</font>

645
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,959
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if it's good for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

646
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,470
might be good for community and we

647
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:03,380
created<font color="#E5E5E5"> web interface or our to which</font>

648
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:07,910
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now to do next good things for you</font>

649
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:14,480
as community you could explore<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network</font>

650
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:18,440
graph and since we recreate a SPF local

651
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,890
PF we could establish<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s relationships</font>

652
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:26,780
is it upstream is it fear or paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer</font>

653
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:28,910
or is it a customer having this model we

654
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:32,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduce the constructor which allows</font>

655
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:35,690
you to easily design your<font color="#E5E5E5"> autonomous</font>

656
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:38,449
system if you connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this upstream</font>

657
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:43,240
will it be balance ball why I means that

658
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:46,970
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like bgp as path prepending if</font>

659
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,890
not probably it's not a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea before</font>

660
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:52,550
that we couldn't find out if it's

661
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:54,470
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need this tool and right</font>

662
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:57,889
now it works for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us it probably should</font>

663
00:29:54,470 --> 00:30:00,890
work for you and since we're scanning

664
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:06,620
this network anyways we decided to add

665
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:10,610
some security data in the process the

666
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:14,389
core of technology is finding out<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES</font>

667
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:17,810
relationships and there is interesting

668
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:21,860
stuff about bgp bgp is mostly not about

669
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:23,860
network but about money so idea is

670
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:29,209
follow the money if you see in someone

671
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:31,040
peed in with someone whose could sell

672
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:34,430
this traffic to them probably this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

673
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:40,399
paid here so we can establish that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

674
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:41,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we can do this quite reliably what</font>

675
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">next</font>

676
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:48,139
we also managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to recover all the</font>

677
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:50,770
lesser attributes and includes them in

678
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:55,160
the model giving us good prediction of

679
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:57,889
traffic in grass and results could be

680
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:02,179
seen in this nice dashboard on our

681
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:05,630
website and you can see what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> autonomous system or your</font>

that's I don't have that to offer so the

761
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:51,730
people the back have presented that

762
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:54,160
those results right here now I have to

763
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:57,190
apologize because my coatings foo is

764
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,839
weak<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so my scripts did not parse as</font>

765
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:01,660
well as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought they were going to so</font>

766
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,030
I kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands jammed the data in Excel</font>

767
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,620
and then ported it back to here so I try

768
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,660
to include so that's why I included the

769
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,830
result detail here the count so you can

770
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,540
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and make sure that my numbers</font>

771
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:12,340
work out right so the answers that we

772
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:14,080
had to the first question in what year

773
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,390
do you think ipv6 will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> cheaper</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

774
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,980
ipv4 or dual stack and I left these

775
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,569
questions intentionally vague because i

776
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:22,180
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out what you think</font>

777
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:24,940
the question means they're 111 responses

778
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,759
the average response was 2017 and the

779
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:31,150
80th percentile was 2019 so eighty

780
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,550
percent of the 111 respondents said 2019

781
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:35,260
or earlier in what year do you think

782
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:38,260
ipv6 will be will offer better

783
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:41,500
performance than ipv4 110 responses and

784
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average was 2016 and 80 percentile</font>

785
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,040
again was 2019<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found that one</font>

786
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,500
especially surprising since I had three

787
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,350
or four people yesterday saying ipv6 is

788
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,630
already faster than ipv4 but hey that's

789
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:54,520
why I asked a whole bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and</font>

790
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,900
then the last question was in what year

791
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:58,480
do you think a significant number of

792
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,710
users will have ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> only and I expected</font>

793
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one to be a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit further out</font>

794
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,260
indeed it was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average was 20 20 or</font>

795
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,950
later I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pushed out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 25 saying</font>

796
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,540
yeah everybody was saying

797
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:11,419
you know that that's gonna be a long way

798
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:14,029
out how when I look at the result detail

799
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:15,530
for each of those I'm suspicious that my

800
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:19,190
math didn't work right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

801
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:21,890
that doesn't feel like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the average</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is 20</font>

802
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:24,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 year later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there so please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feel free</font>

803
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:26,509
to go and play<font color="#E5E5E5"> with numbers yourselves i</font>

804
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:29,180
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably also put a link on this</font>

805
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,770
page to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the summary of the data</font>

806
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,149

807
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,190
want to one of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

808
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,220
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i found is as i was looking</font>

809
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:39,020
at these was the cheaper dates so if you

810
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,328
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was the detail there and</font>

811
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,880
you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the 80th percentile is down</font>

812
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:48,770
at 2019 but it is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting</font>

813
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:51,500
that of the 100 respondents what 50 you

814
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:54,680
know at least half said 20 17 or 20 18

815
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:57,140
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that there it isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

816
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:59,089
being pushed far out so there are

817
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely really good reasons that it</font>

818
00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds like the rough consensus of</font>

819
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:05,598
people who are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well informed is</font>

820
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:09,380
it's not that many years away before

821
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:16,430
ipv6 is better faster and cheaper thank

822
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:17,960
you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much i forgot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

823

would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask different questions or</font>

824

or wish that these questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> were worded</font>
