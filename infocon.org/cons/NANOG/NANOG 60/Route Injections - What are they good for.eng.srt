between what you're developing your

00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:32,170
agency one which has been discreet these

40
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:35,500
are out injection or just really

41
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:37,150
detrimental to a lot of our customers so

42
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,850
I really encourage everybody to

43
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:42,520
personate data<font color="#E5E5E5"> import we're doing a</font>

wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is after you bought</font>

46
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,540
these injected ropes what's the

47
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:53,290
mechanism that's taking place to try and

48
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:58,930
identify with the actual causes of the

49
00:15:53,290 --> 00:16:02,699
injected rose what do you think it's

50
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,699
really all we have is about these data

51
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:10,000
if there's like some mechanism that can

52
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:13,899
be developed the identification of

53

inherited wrote and promptly turns that

54
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:20,829
around into notifying the originator and

55
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,930
somehow cleansing it that does a lot for
