00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,310

24
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,619
the anti flip language was originally

incorporated into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transfer</font>

26

people wouldn't obtained an allocation

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,870
from

29

then turn around and<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell it and then go</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">back for more but what they're</font>

31
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:51,949
suggesting is that the current wording

32
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:55,310
poses a problem in that large companies

33
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,020
with subsidiaries and and that our

34
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,590
collection of organizations they can't

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:02,149
transfer blocks within themselves

36
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:05,330
because they run<font color="#CCCCCC"> up against this in time</font>

37
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:13,580
flipping language so what they had

38
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:19,280
proposed as to add the red text to the

39
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:21,350
existing section to exempt the transfers

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,430
within organizations and their

41
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:27,700
subsidiaries and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gist of the</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> flip back to the proposed</font>

language it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one sentence this</font>

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:27,580
looks to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the intent of this</font>

61
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,050
proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to affect organizations</font>

62
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:32,260
rather than blocks and my understanding

63
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the anti flipping licenses is that it</font>

64
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,070
would affect<font color="#CCCCCC"> block the idea is if you've</font>

65
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,360
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to convince somebody to</font>

66
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:44,170
transfer a block of addresses to you

67
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,610
then you shouldn't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to flip</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

68
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,869
same block of addresses that should be

69
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:51,760
locked down for 12 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> incidence</font>

70
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,370
and it doesn't affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> an M&A transfers</font>

71
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,220
which is sort of implied as currently we

72
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,380
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of implied a question about in the</font>

73
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,590
in the next slide of ethical questions

74
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,630
so I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see is a</font>

75
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:06,970
restriction on transferring blocks of

76
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:12,010
addresses rather than what organizations

77
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,989
can do so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> propose anti flipping</font>

78
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,329
approach which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on a block that</font>

79
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:18,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">has been transferred being prohibited</font>

80
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:21,459
from transfer for a certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

81
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,840
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but that's actually not what</font>

82
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:25,710
the current language says the current

83
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:29,710
language is the language in black which

84
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:32,469
simply applies to organizations so this

85
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,169
enhances the current language and the

86
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:36,760
current approach proposed a different

87
00:04:35,169 --> 00:04:40,150
tack on it which may or may not be

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">better but is a different way of solving</font>

89
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,340
that problem

90
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,250
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is completed a long road</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay by the way is very Susan does this</font>

thanks Scott lab ran an errand AC

responding to these comment and the

98
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:07,169
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in black that is</font>

99
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:11,009
currency was intended<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prevent the</font>

100
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:14,039
case where someone gets has a bunch of

101
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:17,190
space gets a new block from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron and</font>

102
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,409
then goes and sells off their other

103
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,659
space that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> already have so this is</font>

104
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:23,909
based on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that IP addresses can</font>

105
00:05:21,659 --> 00:05:26,210
be somewhat fungible if you have dynamic

106
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:29,430
addressing and such and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

107
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,930
restricting the individual block<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

108
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">you receive from them being transferred</font>

109
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,340
out doesn't fix the problem if you have

110
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,109
another block that you can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer</font>

111
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it instead so that's the reason for the</font>

112
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,840
current black deck the proposal here

113
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:47,068
asserts that that is a to restrictive

114
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,469
form of anti flipping and that there

115
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:51,090
should be a caveat<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you're not</font>

116
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:52,080
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> and selling it off on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the market</font>

117
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,369
to someone else but you're just

118
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,740
transferring it to your own subsidiary

119
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,180
that that should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fine now the</font>

120
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,180
language that you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about i</font>

121
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,699
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually might be in the other</font>

122
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:04,909
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the transfer policy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

123
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,590
there there may be a individual block

124
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:09,389
insightful think there are different

125
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,609
types<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anti flipping language in</font>

126
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:13,740
section<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 already this is one of them</font>

127
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the author feels it is to determine</font>

128
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,300
wants to relax it so that's the part

129
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,818
that we are discussing but i think the

130
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,720
lock based stuff is already elsewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

131
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:24,280
was

132
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,949
to be not good enough when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we originally</font>

136
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:35,949
remember the AC I hadn't yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> formed an</font>

00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:02,770
I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that anything that reduces the</font>

147
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:05,560
liquidity of ipv4 space trading hurts

148
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:07,990
all of us and makes it more difficult to

149
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,650
continue propping up ipv4 for as long as

150
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fees okay opposed got</font>

it that time for sure as you get it yeah

152
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,979
I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time I apologize to mr.</font>

153
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,599
Howard again don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> all approach the</font>

154
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,630
mikes at once and if we have any remote

155
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,949
participants perhaps hopefully they can

156
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,110
hear what I've been told to switch back

157
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:35,530
to this mic so they can hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> it they</font>

158
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:40,150
can't hear me too bad for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them more</font>

159
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:44,169
feedback none standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pathway maybe</font>

160
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:47,169
again it's been pointed out to me that I

161
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:48,940
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have misinterpreted the policy so</font>

162
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:50,740
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to reread it so you can</font>

163
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,919
withdraw my objection furnace so

164
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,919
withdrawn

165
00:07:56,289 --> 00:08:02,259
so we'll close the mics or ask anyone

166
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:10,029
remotely to start typing seen shaking of

167

169
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,589
gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> some feedback on this unless I'm</font>

mr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sweeting you'd like any further</font>

173
00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:30,520
will all turn it back over to John thank

174
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:33,990
you I remind<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone to speak close to</font>

175
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,990
the mics when you're speaking of ledge

176
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:45,939
you got a live one andrew dahl comment

177
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:48,069
this policy proposal makes a significant

178
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:49,930
change to the ability of an organization

179
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:52,810
to transfer a block outside the errand

180
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:55,569
service region until the inter rir

181
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,638
transfer policy was adopted the ability

182
00:08:55,569 --> 00:09:01,979
of an organization to move their block

183
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:04,510
to another region was largely restricted

184
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:09,819
thank you Andrew I'll now turn it over

185
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:13,389
to John again<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're going to pick</font>

186
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:18,099
up on schedule next policy proposal is

187
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:23,940
draft policy 2000 remove the 82 83 and

188
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,940
84 minimum ipv4 block size requirements

189
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:37,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay as noted this is a new policy</font>

190
00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:38,709
proposal submitted in January the

191
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:42,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shepherd's are owned along and built</font>

192
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:46,329
dark it was accepted as a draft policy

193
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:47,860
by the AC it is a work in progress and

194
00:09:46,329 --> 00:09:49,660
so the AC is trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

195
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:52,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's good number policy is it fair and</font>

196
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,639
impartial is it technically sound and is

197
00:09:52,089 --> 00:10:08,100
it supported<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> turn it over to Dan to</font>

198
00:09:54,639 --> 00:10:10,920
give the AC presentation close to it so

199
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:18,689
on this one this one's actually even

200
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:18,689
shorter than the previous one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

201
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,800
so this one's actually a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little shorter</font>

202
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:28,040
than even the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other one in that what the</font>

203
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,120
author is suggesting is in the current

204
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:36,560
sections of the the transfer proposals

205
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:39,140
there is a / 24 minimum saying only

206
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,319
blocks of a 24 or larger will actually

207
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:44,660
be accepted as a transfer what he's

208
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:51,800
suggesting here is that that requirement

209
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:55,250
be removed and any size be allowed so

210
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,469
essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> section 8 2 3 & 4 just</font>

211
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,240
remove the sections<font color="#CCCCCC"> that remove the</font>

212
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:04,190
clauses that say a minimum transfer size

213
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:06,680
of a / 24 so what we're soliciting here

214
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:10,190
is opinions about whether that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

215
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,780
idea bad idea and whether it should be

216
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:17,840
allowed what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

217
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:21,890
implications discuss mr. Howard it's

218
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:23,900
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember my name Lee having to</font>

219
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:26,600
come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and identify myself because</font>

220
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:29,720
that's the rules Lee Howard this is a

221
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,520
terrible idea please don't do this would

222
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:37,400
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like my opinion are you in favor</font>

223
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:39,740
against so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is essentially proposing</font>

224
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,510
that not only deck chairs but individual

225
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:44,090
components of decks chairs made me

226
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:51,560
rearranged this is stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> before is dead</font>

227
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:53,930
deploy these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you me what</font>

228
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,380
anyone else like to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> a concept</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

229
00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:00,920
it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple proposal Scott Scott</font>

230
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:04,310
library with limelight networks down but

231
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,059
mostly speaking for myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not in a</font>

232
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:11,689
seat

233
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:14,539
um okay for a while viewing there are a

234
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:17,149
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

235
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:18,379
requested transfers of / 32 because they

236
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,959
don't understand how the internet works

237
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:22,459
and they want their IP address I think

238
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,529
there are even individuals who requested

239
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:26,118
strands of / 32 these may have may or

240
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:27,349
may not have gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Aaron as actual</font>

241
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:30,649
request but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who want to</font>

242
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:35,089
transfer their IP I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

243
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:36,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">our policy should allow such if there is</font>

244
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,919
a good technical justification for

245
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:42,319
reducing the minimum transfers eyes from

246
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,269
24 to something smaller I might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

247
00:12:42,319 --> 00:12:51,889
that but eliminating completely is a bad

idea thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stacey do we have</font>

any remote participation you got one

00:12:56,649 --> 00:13:03,469
Stacy will check her homies I think I'm

251
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:09,559
slightly uncomfortable saying that I

252
00:13:03,469 --> 00:13:11,299
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why that's true we're going</font>

255
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:21,259

percentage for the community for

discussion the AC is looking for

00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:24,139
the AC presentation thank you John hello

274
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:28,129
ladies and gentlemen good morning so

275
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:32,509
this may look familiar this is an item

276
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:36,949
that is substantially similar to

277
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:39,670
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else we looked at earlier the</font>

278
00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:44,479
problem statement on this particular

279
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:46,729
proposal is draft policy is section 4.25

280
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,220
is technology specific language that is

281
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,220
not current with modern<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

282
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:59,209
operation needs and practices we should

283
00:14:52,220 --> 00:15:01,819
remove it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RPM clearer there's</font>

284
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:10,399
the the current wording it's been in

285
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:11,809
place since july of 2001 it's I say

286
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:17,240
functionally identical to the last

287
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:21,019
bullet<font color="#E5E5E5"> item of 2013 7 the the differing</font>

288
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,029
problem statement is there the author

289
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,279
has been asked and answered that he

290
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:29,920
would specifically like it submitted and

291
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,720

in community my<font color="#E5E5E5"> impression from the ppl</font>

403
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:59,749
all discussion is that since<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

404
00:21:53,239 --> 00:22:01,799
changed to using a per zone per block

405
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:04,590
model that they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really been</font>

406
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:06,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing this per server based thing that</font>

407
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:09,709
we instructed them to do a decade ago or

408
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:11,570
whatever long it's been and therefore

409
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,899
removing this doesn't actually change

410
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:18,149
operational practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> however if as Lee</font>

411
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:21,359
suggested that is something that still

412
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:22,709
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed or if has Jeff suggested there</font>

413
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,590
may be other reasons for doing something

414
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:28,019
it would seem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually need new</font>

415
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,959
guidance to Aaron as to what they should

416
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:33,899
be doing in the new world of delegation

417
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,639
of individual blocks and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

418
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:37,469
say this server is entirely bad if it's

419
00:22:35,639 --> 00:22:40,529
just as one block<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not responding</font>

420
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,299
etc etc so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we either need to get</font>

421
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:44,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">rid of this or we need to have a new</font>

422
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:46,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">proposal that does the opposite but the</font>

423
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,210
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status quo is rather silly</font>

424
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:51,059
because we're instructing to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron to</font>

425
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:54,960
do something they can't do and that's

426
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:56,879
dumb yeah in 2009 mark gave a

427
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,440
presentation of Aaron meeting where he

428
00:22:56,879 --> 00:23:03,779
noted that the definition<font color="#CCCCCC"> of lame for a</font>

429
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,230
server when what you're testing is

430
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:09,989
individual zones is somewhat not

431
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,919
canonical and therefore needed

432
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:17,609
clarification from the community if

433
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:21,130
folks want to remove this from a dress

434
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:23,250

435
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:28,690
that clarifies the situation obviously

if folks want us to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> here it</font>

responsive going to the next step of

440
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:42,580
actual removal I will say once I

441
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:45,010
understand what you're advocating we

442

need to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal review because it's</font>

443
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:52,660
not clear that removal of servers from

444
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:56,290
records is a fair risk trade-off for

if there's an existing definition of

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:37,139
that we delegate responsibility for the

you're saying it doesn't work without 70

I suit you're saying right I see it's

the fall it would be nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess to</font>

575
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:20,460
have language that actually relates to

for the zone thank you well there's a

586
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,740
sight for sore eyes haven't seen you in

589
00:32:53,900 --> 00:33:02,120
second yes I just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take issue</font>

590
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:03,889
with the bottom point while I do not

591
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,899
have a top of my head the exact

592
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:09,410
statistic for how much ipv6 has been

593
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:11,870
deployed I will quote<font color="#E5E5E5"> Geoff Huston</font>

594
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:14,000
roughly earlier that it is a barren

595
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:16,610
wasteland on the edges of the internet i

596
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,680
think is how he phrased it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure</font>

597
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:24,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">that taking the current state</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ipv6 as</font>

598
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,890
representative of well anything is a

599
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:30,469
good idea so I that bullet point just

600
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,880
struck me as all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wrong and no</font>

601
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:36,560
view on the proposal just that's a

602
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,540
comment or I think I think Martin kind

603
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,149
of touched more on my general thought I

604
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,360
think Aaron needs somewhere some policy

605
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:46,550
on amader DARPA it is quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear to me</font>

606
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,949
that there are many policy proposals

607
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:50,690
attempting to adjust that in multiple

608
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:52,970
ways and depending on which was which

609
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:55,400
are passed or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not pass we could end</font>

610
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:58,340
up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really good or a totally absurd</font>

611
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,720
place and so given that there are so

612
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:02,570
many I don't know how to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a position</font>

613
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">on one your point is taken thank you</font>

614
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:08,210
will close the mics if there's no

615
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,400
there's no more participation oh there

the suggested proposal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the</font>

operators get together to justify an

<font color="#CCCCCC">that was raised was that this this</font>

presents possible situations of abuse as

661

the free pool gets depleted and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it suggested that maybe that bar is set</font>

663
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:52,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">too low so what the policy statement</font>

664
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:56,800
suggests is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum requirement</font>

be raised from<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to three two</font>

hopefully present that prevent that

667
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:06,049
potential for abuse there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a</font>

fair amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion on the the</font>

raised one point that was made on the

other side was for smaller countries in

three people together that this could

681
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:48,760
cause issues for them so they're there

682
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:51,830
is two sides of this discussion and

683
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:59,840
we're interested to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> more points of</font>

amount of address space we're talking

00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:35,589
about will do nothing to preserve the

related to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a transparency that</font>

said I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to shift hats and what</font>

723
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,650

that did relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this change they're</font>

saying then that policy that really

established before this policy was

entertainment no my question being you

728
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:12,469
brought that up as<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the policy speak</font>

develop programs on for example there's

00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:57,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">certified and and you know meet those</font>

794
00:42:56,069 --> 00:43:00,060
minimum standards that the community was

795
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,899
pulled on that said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what we</font>

796
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:05,880
want from IXPs and granted the Caribbean

797
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:08,010
is what this seems the objection seems

798
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:09,510
to be about and it is unique and and I

799
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that a lot of people want to help</font>

800
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:13,290
them make things succeed but I think

801
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need to start with some</font>

802
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:17,640
realistic criteria and I think that this

803
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,369
has come this is fairly reasonable and

804
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:22,078
simple and that's a and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

805
00:43:20,369 --> 00:43:24,660
supportive of the text that we can't

808
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:34,040
it's above using the resources properly

00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:34,040
and getting some successes thank you sir

810
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:42,119
go ahead sir like Joseph<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google I oppose</font>

811
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:44,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">this policy first tackling the latter</font>

812
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,500
portion first I believe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

813
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:49,980
existing for foreign language oversteps

814
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,260
the scope of the NR p.m. and i believe

815
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:54,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the underlying section here further</font>

816
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:57,089
oversteps the scope it should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

817
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:00,119
proper domain of the board to determine

818
00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:02,250
how organizations are classified for the

819
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:04,230
purpose of payment of fees and to

820
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:08,010
explicitly call out the taxable status

821
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:10,650
of an organization in the NR p.m. to

822
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:12,750
determine fee structure is in my opinion

823
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,579
wholly inappropriate particularly

824
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:16,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">considering that the errand service</font>

825
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:19,290
region may include countries in which

826
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:21,869
the NRP the proposed enter p.m. language

827
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:23,579
is not not applicable so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

828
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:26,579
important that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the board have the leeway</font>

829
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:30,359
to develop the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most appropriate language</font>

830
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:32,369
and policy for determining the fee

831
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:33,720
structure for critical critical

832
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:39,450

834
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:44,930
I'm sympathetic to the the abuse concern

835
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:47,280
here I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly see some</font>

836
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:50,339
potential for abuse<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I would be</font>

837
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested to hear staff opinion as to</font>

00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:57,119
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they've seen any abuse of</font>

839
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,400
this policy to date but I can see also a

840
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,340
potential chicken and egg problem you

841
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,720
have your first I XP participant and you

842
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:05,310
want to give them addresses but you have

843
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,740
to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait until somebody else</font>

844

845
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:11,129
their addresses and I can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that being</font>

846
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:13,140
a problem so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that it's</font>

847
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:14,780
necessary to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for three but I</font>

848
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,098
would be interested to hear static

851
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:28,190
two questions first with<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to the</font>

852
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:36,348
the scope issue regarding whether this

Texas within scope for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NR p.m. I</font>

854
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:42,839
believe that we can in the staff

855
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,609
assessment make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we address that and</font>

856
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:49,400
figure out the right way to phrase the

857
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:49,400
intent there is a certainly a

858
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:53,609
distinguishing organizations for

859
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:55,109
purposes of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they qualify</font>

860
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:57,060
for resources and whether or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

861
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:59,609
treated<font color="#E5E5E5"> as end users or is BS is</font>

862
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:01,770
perfectly appropriate in part of an RPM

863
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:03,598
I agree the fee question is done in an

864
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:05,509
hour p.m. issue but we'll pick that up

865
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,580
in the staff assessment of the policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

866
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:09,980
was adjusted nonprofits that is why not

867
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,580
being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Turkey and as you either</font>

868
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:16,770
understood unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> it unless it affects</font>

869
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,710
what resources parties are entitled to

870
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:21,390
because the NR PM has allocation or

871
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:24,230
assignment policy that directly is

872
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:27,690
germane to one or the other it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

873
00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:29,970
foolish policy that's a different

874
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:32,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">question it would be in scope foolish</font>

875
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:35,368
policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but I the fee question I</font>

876
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:37,980
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second question you asked</font>

877
00:46:35,369 --> 00:46:39,359
about abuse I don't think abuse we see

878
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:41,520
much of with respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this but</font>

879
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,029
recognize there's a difference between

880
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,290
abuse and aspirational use and a party

881
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,990
that gets an address block and then

882
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:50,529
doesn't fulfill

883
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:52,810
their goals and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dreams is not abuse but</font>

884
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:58,030
its fulfillment that didn't happen and

885
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:59,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do have quite a bit of that one</font>

886
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:02,590
question I wanted to ask is if we back

887
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:05,680
up from the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the difference of</font>

888
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:09,310
two and three being a matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of abuse as</font>

889
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:12,040
I already tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clarify that the</font>

890
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:15,279
three it<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's more to an industry</font>

891
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:17,830
acceptable definition does that do you

892
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,750
have an opinion about that um so first

893
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:21,670
of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> the larger portion of my objection</font>

894
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:23,860
is about the the second half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the text</font>

895
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:28,720
but concerning that the first portion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

896
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:30,580
the text I would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> comfortable saying</font>

897
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there was an intent to have more</font>

898
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:34,869
than two participants but that

899
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:36,340
withholding the space until the third

900
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:38,590
shows up would you contention a

901
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:39,970
problematic I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure how to best</font>

902
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:41,980
capture that in policy and I don't take

903
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:45,180
a strong position on the two versus

904
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,180
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> them thank you</font>

905
00:47:47,370 --> 00:47:53,740
Heather shell or Google Fiber so on that

906
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,930
some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a policy is written</font>

907
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:58,029
mostly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the second statement</font>

908
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:00,640
that's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> added about my excuses</font>

909
00:47:58,030 --> 00:48:04,570
nonprofits in regards to the two versus

910
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:08,410
three um there's a total of<font color="#CCCCCC"> like 66</font>

911
00:48:04,570 --> 00:48:10,540
current<font color="#CCCCCC"> ixp allocation so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

912
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:13,509
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about like a huge number of</font>

913
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:16,509
allocations that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think will have a</font>

914
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:20,110
significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact so not I mean it</font>

915
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:22,030
raises<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bar it but barely yeah i</font>

916
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:23,740
think someone on the list that<font color="#CCCCCC"> raised it</font>

917
00:48:22,030 --> 00:48:26,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> else means that</font>

918
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,540
that's fine with me too but the part

919
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:31,150
about IXPs formed is nonprofit so

920
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:32,680
there's far more at least grammatically

921
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:37,480
the way it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> all others</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

922
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:41,069
considered<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs in context of the larger</font>

923
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:43,450
4.4 section implies that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a bomb</font>

924
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:46,450
the folks who get a critical

925
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:48,399
infrastructure space for non isp

926
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:50,799
purposes would be considered eyes peas

927
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,260
as well and so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are far more of</font>

928
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:57,340
those allocations than there are 0 x XP

929
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:59,200
allocations and the far more of them are

930
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:01,930
currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font>

931
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:04,149
adversely impacted by becoming<font color="#CCCCCC"> isps</font>

932
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:07,299
Elvis financially impacted so I think

933
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:11,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that that policy board is more</font>

934
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:13,870
implication for the non IXPs than it

935
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,279
does for<font color="#E5E5E5"> XPS whether they're non problem</font>

936
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:18,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that just says</font>

937
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,400
all yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> nbk so you only see this section</font>

938
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,430
the one part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of section 4.4 which is</font>

939
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,290
part of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> larger piece of policy I don't</font>

940
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:29,020
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the entire statement and</font>

941
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:32,920
so the 4.4 is the entire my craw

942
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:35,080
allocation section which that my other

943
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,000
micro allocations are made for other

944
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,700
types of critical infrastructure like

945
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:44,050
operators and so the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

946
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:47,020
way that is written that it implies that

947
00:49:44,050 --> 00:49:48,550
that part applies to GMs operators as

948
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,050
well and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is just that there are</font>

949
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:51,340
far more of those type of allocation

950
00:49:50,050 --> 00:49:53,770
yeah the Heather is correct that you

951
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">know it's on page 32 of your book that</font>

952
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">the section 4.4 actually has other</font>

953
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:59,980
paragraphs that aren't here so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

954
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:03,550
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to consider that both the AC in the</font>

955
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:05,110
membership communities all right last

956
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,670
comment will close the mics if you're

957
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:08,320
going to speak on this item please

958
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:10,960
either start typing or approach a mic

959
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:14,050
otherwise we'll close it up after this

960
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:15,610
gentleman starts speaking perhaps name

961
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:17,410
and affiliation please<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

962
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:19,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">rosenthal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> form is prime thanks and</font>

963
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:22,270
perhaps a better way of looking at it is

964
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,150
not for initial allocation but perhaps

965
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:28,720
looking at it as an audit if over the

966
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:30,160
past year of activity I know with you

967
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,040
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some exchanges that we've been</font>

968
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:34,180
looking at that are launching now you

969
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,400
know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of participants</font>

970
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:38,379
talking about joining every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

971
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,450
of them are content I'm a Content

972
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:43,150
company we're interested in joining but

973
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:45,970
there isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily much value</font>

974
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:48,880
necessarily in you know in actually

975
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:51,850
joining when there is you know no

976
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,860
eyeballs on on that exchange that gets

977
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:57,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">into you know way beyond what you know</font>

978
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:59,440
your proposal of course but my point is

979
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:02,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these exchanges do not grow</font>

980
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,260
explosively respond taneously they grow

981
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:07,060
organically and if you you know say you

982
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:10,030
have to have a minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> of X number of</font>

983
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:12,340
participants day one it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible you</font>

984
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,870
will never have that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after six</font>

985
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,070
months you know you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know a</font>

986
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">few people that will join</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it will</font>

987
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:19,510
attract others and if the exchange

988
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:20,980
failed you know take the space back its

989
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:23,110
out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a special</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> block that shouldn't be</font>

990
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:25,000
used for anything else anyway right so

991
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:27,130
so you're not sore would you be

992
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,290
supportive of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or you feel that I on</font>

993
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:31,790
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it needs more text I</font>

994
00:51:29,290 --> 00:51:33,680
don't have to be an audit rather than

995
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:36,650
initial allocation so as it is I am

996
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:41,660
against it thank you microphones are

997
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:47,090
closed any remote thank you next micro

998
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:49,490
so sure the second name and the second

999
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:52,130
half<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it again I'm going on for a</font>

1000
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:55,220
little proposal wind I put it there<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1001
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:56,960
clean up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think correctly to clean up</font>

1002
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:59,419
some existing language so<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure clean it</font>

1003
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,600
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have no opposition whatsoever</font>

1004
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:05,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">dar having that adapted to whatever you</font>

1005
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:07,700
want it to be with respect to the two

1006
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:10,450
versus three re numbering is easy

1007
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:13,910
especially when it's two to three and

1009
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:18,379
where we suggest renumber it is easy as

1010
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,319
well and again it's not about abuse it's

1011
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:24,650
about conservation and the 16 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

rapid manner in the next 36 months so

1016
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:37,370
I'm just seeking to raise the bar a

1017
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:39,440
little bit in by the way if you guys

1018
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:41,569
want to go to five that's perfectly fine

1019
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:45,350

gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> released into the free pool at</font>

1038
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:34,460
i dont rember this yeah at this point we

1039
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:37,630
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> look fit at the end of the policy</font>

1040
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:37,630
term at this

1041
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:49,680
right at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are the policy</font>

1042
00:53:47,369 --> 00:53:52,400
term is no longer defined Heather go

1043
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,399
ahead you're going to say something

1044
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:04,560
because he asked that<font color="#E5E5E5"> last month and um</font>

1045
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,810
I thought that what you said was that it

1046
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,759
was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kept indefinitely right</font>

1047
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,560
it was that they didn't have plans to

1048
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:13,970
release it right there's no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1049
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:15,770
reference antecedent for that phrase

1050
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:26,189
Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> Heather for that clarification</font>

1051
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:27,780
and Leslie go ahead of 2016 I think I

1052
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:31,200
told you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you wouldn't release the</font>

1053
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:35,040
space but then that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current policy</font>

1054
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:40,770
doesn't happen in a term limit it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1055
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:43,440
defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough how much for me at the AC</font>

1056
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:45,839
should take it upon itself to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1057
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:50,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">to this policy either to remove the</font>

1058
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:51,839
expiration or set date certain thank you

1059
00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:53,430
John and AC can take that in

1060
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:57,200
consideration heatherwood did that

1061
00:54:53,430 --> 00:55:00,359
clarify or leak or confuse the matter

1062
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:02,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you so with respect to that</font>

1063
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:05,819
question I actually made that change to

1064
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,430
that specific policy as well and I

1065
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:11,160
specifically recall my intent was that I

1066
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:13,259
believe once we dipped into the last / 8

1067
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,170
that allocations would come from that

1068
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:17,490
block<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 36 months later that whatever</font>

1069
00:55:16,170 --> 00:55:19,350
was left in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the block</font>

1070
00:55:17,490 --> 00:55:21,930
back to the free pool and my intention

1071
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:23,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I wrote that was that we we weren't</font>

1072
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:26,609
providing a crutch for people to hobble

1073
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,260
along on before forever we were giving

1074
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:32,730
them an opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get started and</font>

1075
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:34,590
then get their asses over ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i</font>

1076
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:37,850
think is<font color="#E5E5E5"> john curran say that it would</font>

1077
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:41,160
be helpful theae could clarify that

1078
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:42,420
language we had close the mics was there

1079
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:45,540
anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> on just this last point</font>

1088
00:56:03,619 --> 00:56:09,570
proposals three proposals that drawn

<font color="#CCCCCC">Sweeting is going to just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let the</font>

1091
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,859
are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet draft policies that AC is</font>

1092
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:19,820
still working on the text but they've

1093
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:22,530
received them from submitters and so

1094
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:33,350
John if you want to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and talk</font>

1095
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:37,770
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposals 193 199 and 201 okay so</font>

1096
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:39,750
193 199 should be fairly quick we

1097
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:42,600
probably won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have what asked for much</font>

1098
00:56:39,750 --> 00:56:46,290
discussion on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but 201 we'll</font>

1099
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:53,069
probably get some some good discussion

1100
00:56:46,290 --> 00:56:58,950
going ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm proposals and under the</font>

1101
00:56:53,070 --> 00:57:00,900
new policy process proposals come in

1102
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:03,180
they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the AC the AC works with the</font>

1103
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:06,420
author<font color="#E5E5E5"> the author controls that proposal</font>

1104
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:10,618
until such time is it's determined to be

1105
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:13,500
clear and in scope and then the AC can

1106
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:16,050
move it into a draft policy status and

1107
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:19,440
that's when it gets posted 2<font color="#E5E5E5"> ppm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L we</font>

1108
00:57:16,050 --> 00:57:21,119
start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for input based on the</font>

1109
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,740
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself in trying to create good</font>

1110
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:27,780
policy so these proposals are still with

1111
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,729
the AC working with the author trying to

1112
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:32,390
get clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem statement and making</font>

1113
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:32,390
sure it's at scope

1114
00:57:33,229 --> 00:57:40,259
most likely these proposals will be on

1115
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:44,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">the air and 33 agenda in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago and you</font>

1116
00:57:40,259 --> 00:57:46,170
should see them probably on PP ml after

1117
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:47,999
our next after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ac's next meeting</font>

1118
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:53,579
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third Thursday of this</font>

1119
00:57:47,999 --> 00:57:56,160
month so the 193 is alignment of eight

1120
00:57:53,579 --> 00:58:00,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">that three needs requirements to reality</font>

1121
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:02,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">of business and 199 is to resolve</font>

1122
00:58:00,299 --> 00:58:05,788
conflict between the IRSA and eight dot

1123
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:07,558
to utilization requirements most you

1124
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:13,309
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen these I think David</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">huberman the author posted these two ppl</font>

1126
00:58:13,309 --> 00:58:20,509
but i'm not i'm not sure there was a

1127
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:23,848
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of discussion on him the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aaron</font>

1128
00:58:20,509 --> 00:58:25,769
proposal 201 is to remove sections for

00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:40,249
suspension action that was taken earlier

1132
00:58:35,269 --> 00:58:44,430
this year when it was pointed out that

1133
00:58:40,249 --> 00:58:48,269
there was an actual danger to aaron

1134
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:52,140
there if these sections<font color="#E5E5E5"> remained in</font>

00:58:48,269 --> 00:58:55,348
force<font color="#E5E5E5"> and could be used and basically</font>

1136
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:59,879
that was somebody with a any company

1137
00:58:55,349 --> 00:59:02,279
with a fairly really large bunch of

1138

1147
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:31,650
in and said they<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted or if they had</font>

1148
00:59:30,239 --> 00:59:34,440
all their addresses together came in and

1149
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:36,739
said well we won a / 8 to renumber into

1150
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:39,059
so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one aggregate so I</font>

1151
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:41,130
believe that's why the board took that

1152
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:42,789
action it was on the list there was a

1153
00:59:41,130 --> 00:59:46,329
lot of discussion

1154
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:49,660
and in accordance with the PDP the AC

1155
00:59:46,329 --> 00:59:53,319
had to make a recommendation on that

1156
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:55,678
suspension which we agreed on in our

1157
00:59:53,319 --> 01:00:00,489
last meeting was posted to the list and

1158
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:02,199
is still there still can be commented on

1159
01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:06,489
it had to be there and take comments for

1160
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:08,160
14 days but the gist of the ac's

1161
01:00:06,489 --> 01:00:10,749
recommendation was to continue

1162
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,979
continuance of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspension and we</font>

1163
01:00:10,749 --> 01:00:18,038
also submitted a belief dan alexander is

1164
01:00:14,979 --> 01:00:22,598
the author of record but it was an AC

1165
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:26,319
decision to submit that proposal to

1166
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:31,719
remove those two sections from the nerve

1167
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:36,429
them so that's where we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1168
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:38,829
and we would like to to hear discussion

1175
01:01:04,509 --> 01:01:12,309
problematic so I have no issue with that

and so maybe some time frames and some

01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:04,780
stuff need to be addressed in 46 but I

think removing it would possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> include</font>

probably more like that they would use

remember taking advantage of these

before the free pool is exhausted right

1268
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:38,140
so we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be giving a free full space</font>

for and then you know maybe getting some

01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:42,210
convenient and<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk free to the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that this has now been suspended by the</font>

01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:50,669
board what risks does an organization

1291
01:06:47,130 --> 01:06:53,280
now observe in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> return of address</font>

1292
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:54,900
space to Aaron and how would returning

1293
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,730
address space to Aaron effect that

1294
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:59,250
organizations for their feelings again

1295
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:01,260
so you can return address space very

1296
01:06:59,250 --> 01:07:03,089
risk freedom I've worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a number</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations to do that over the</font>

1298
01:07:03,089 --> 01:07:08,940
decade and so there's no risks the

1299
01:07:06,809 --> 01:07:11,849
circumstance of risks described in the

1300

1306
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:32,880
you must remember in six months well I

01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,190
didn't get the equipment I needed I

1308

can't finish a project well we're taking

the block back and have a nice day so in

1310
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:41,549
the case where someone's remembering out

if any organization actually would

1347
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:35,840
discussions in the past that people get

<font color="#E5E5E5">from here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another room and work with</font>

1355

1357
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:03,130
no assurance they'll be available<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

available for people who want to do

1361
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:13,340
workshop editing of these proposals but

1362
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:15,589
you've got to find a cooperative AC

1363
