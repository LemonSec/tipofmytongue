1
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,340
every one so I was on the fence about

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,200
giving this talk and there were kind of

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,980
two things that took me over that fence

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,890
to actually do it

5
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,570
one was a post on Reddit at late last

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:24,820
week where somebody said hey this open

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,710
convict thing who's doing that and there

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,880
was a comment that said oh that's just

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:30,010
some Google thing they're they're you

10
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,198
know people doing that and then

11
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,480
yesterday is teeth streaming telemetry

12
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:36,670
talk by Cisco which I thought was very

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,250
good some of the comments after that

14
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,870
that seemed suggest similarly that this

15
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,760
was just a Google thing led me to think

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,250
that maybe we should talk about this

17
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,579
myth that nobody uses open config except

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:52,239
Google so they get into their little

19
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:55,030
secret that is false we use open config

20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,500
as it happens so it's also false and I

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,910
know there's a double negative in that

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,250
sentence that I noticed after I

23
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:02,379
submitted it the development of open

24
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:04,629
comic has not stalled I've heard that

25
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:06,910
from a couple of vendors as it happens I

26
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:09,940
guess in their efforts to try and push

27
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,250
back on any implementation efforts but

28
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,789
it is true that the leading member of

29
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:18,459
that community Google has done most of

30
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:20,410
the work for that project that said it

31
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:22,660
is a community and it wasn't without

32
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,750
significant input from the other members

33
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:28,840
which are network operators the open

34
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,759
comic community has several other active

35
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,470
members I won't say it's a huge

36
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,270
community but it does have other active

37
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:36,310
members we are one of them

38
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:38,410
and there are other ISPs and enterprises

39
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,289
that show up and provide input on the

40
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,090
things that they need from those models

41
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:46,569
there are also several production

42
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,630
implementations based on open config out

43
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:53,649
there in the wild isn't quite there yet

44
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:56,470
but it will be very soon the next issue

45
00:01:53,649 --> 00:01:58,270
that people like to point out open comic

46
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,119
has too many gaps in its coverage to be

47
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:03,670
useful this is one of those things that

48
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,369
any kind of open source project when it

49
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:08,949
is young will suffer from but the other

50
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:10,810
issue here is that some people would say

51
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:12,910
I'm waiting for it to be complete or

52
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,250
bigger or better and it's not really

53
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:19,750
what open comic is trying to do it's

54
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,600
meant to be that the operators come to

55
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,220
the community with their use cases

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,859
and implement that section of the model

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:27,540
that provides them a direct benefit

58
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,970
rather than trying to wait for it to be

59
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,890
complete it's an iterative model as a

60
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,220
result sometimes that means we make

61
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,899
changes to it but it's absolutely true

62
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,580
it doesn't cover every possible value

63
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,130
for every tweak for every protocol

64
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:47,970
because it's not supposed to it does

65
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:50,070
mean that the operators when they

66
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,480
require things have to suggest those

67
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:53,040
things and typically that means that

68
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,160
they have to come with the patches that

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:58,220
provide those of that functionality

70
00:02:55,160 --> 00:03:00,600
again development is iterative it is a

71
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,480
community that provides good feedback

72
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,280
and generally it does not take long for

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,250
changes to get merged into the

74
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,110
repository but what I will say it is

75
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,300
important for any operator to work out

76
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,370
what it is they want from open config

77
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,410
themselves the approach that we're

78
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,270
taking to do this is running through our

79
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,400
vendor native configurations and

80
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,710
producing a mapping from that OPA

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,900
convict the side effect of that is it

82
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,840
tells us where the gaps are in the in

83
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,460
the models therefore we have a list of

84
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,870
actionable items that we can prioritize

85
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,660
and work through that's one of the

86
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,940
things we're doing right now

87
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:40,230
next up vendors do not support open

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:43,950
config this is also false all of our

89
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:46,320
major vendors five of them support open

90
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,019
convict to some degree that's not

91
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:51,030
complete it's certainly not current but

92
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,810
what I will say is that they are all

93
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:57,570
showing willingness to implement the

94
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,280
things that we ask them for that mapping

95
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,560
information that I talked about in the

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,240
previous step helps us because that can

97
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,190
give us information that we can then

98
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,650
provide to our vendors to say these are

99
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:09,329
the things in the models that we need

100
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,000
and again we can prioritize that and

101
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,650
people can work through that the

102
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,930
implementation details that vendors have

103
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,579
tend to very typically they have some

104
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,840
agent on the device that intercepts

105
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,729
things that are in an open conflict

106
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,679
namespace and provides some kind of

107
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,840
translation to their vendor native model

108
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,670
under behind the scenes one particular

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,429
vendor can do this in both directions

110
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,020
which is great the one thing it can't do

111
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,040
is tell me the things that it can't

112
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,109
translate back which would be useful

113
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,690
but really what I'm trying to say here

114
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,639
in order to vendors to support the

115
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:42,080
things you need on their devices you

116
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,570
need to tell them you need those things

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,159
I do have one vendor that likes to tell

118
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,810
me that we are the only people asking

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,830
for this I know this is patently not

120
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:53,900
true but my colleagues in other service

121
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,340
providers could do well to let the

122
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:59,810
vendors know if they're interested in

123
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:03,080
this let their vendors know so we're

124
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,810
next for us we're going to continue

125
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,030
developing the models as needed within

126
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,010
the open combat community we do also

127
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:11,630
have an internal representation of open

128
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,080
convict which kind of leads the things

129
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:16,340
we upstream for velocity of course your

130
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,050
help is welcome if you're a network

131
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,090
operator you're welcome to join in the

132
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,500
open convict community we're going to

133
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:24,049
continue to work with our vendors to

134
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,810
increase the support they have for the

135
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:29,479
things we need on our devices again your

136
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:32,509
support is absolutely welcome in that we

137
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:35,479
have several projects in flight if there

138
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:37,070
is interest I'm happy to discuss any of

139
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:38,719
those things in more detail than

140
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,760
alignment all can really allow me to do

141
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,470
and if there's also interest then

142
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,810
perhaps we'll present at a future Nanog

143
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,470
some details on some operational

144
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,789
experience and that is what I had I hope

145
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:57,050
to leave the more time for questions and

146
00:05:49,789 --> 00:06:03,460
I have four or five minutes I guess you

147
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:03,460
want to get a break thank you

148
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,690
you
