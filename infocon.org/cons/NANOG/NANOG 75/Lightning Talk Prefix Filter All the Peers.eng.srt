1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,940
all right thanks for sticking around

2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,829
[Music]

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,009
all right so I'm Chris and I work for a

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:22,730
small advertising company we have a mail

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,380
service - I gave this presentation that

6
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,640
in the Vancouver net I'll give the

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,810
security track so if you saw it there

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,130
it's pretty much the same except for

9
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,490
some dates and a couple links at the end

10
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:33,050
so I'll skip a bunch but basically if

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,500
you're a peer of AAS one five one six

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:40,339
nine you're gonna get prefix filtered

13
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,870
ideally why because wait wait I'm sorry

14
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,920
who else is the transit network in the

15
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:48,559
room rudiger is you are you are good not

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,870
everybody though that's weird I am by

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:56,930
mistake somebody decided this whole let

18
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:59,209
people run VMs thing was a great idea so

19
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,309
we're just gonna grab initially I our

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,850
data we're gonna add some RPI to and we

21
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:05,990
get the technology on our side sorted

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,580
technology's hard and we have some

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,009
internal te thing that we do already so

24
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,110
we'll use that to filter down as well

25
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,550
we're gonna collect the data we're gonna

26
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,140
put it on to our router it looks a lot

27
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:19,640
like that really and we're doing our

28
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,880
method adjust to make it per a s filter

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:27,250
and in filter as we can we're gonna mark

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,929
not today today but like ideally April

31
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,880
then we'll start deep prepping routes

32
00:01:29,929 --> 00:01:33,979
maybe three months later and then after

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,630
three months presuming nobody is still

34
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:39,110
screaming at us about this then we'll

35
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:43,220
just drop routes so notification this is

36
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,289
it notifying peers hi we actually have

37
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,429
some official documentation that our

38
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:48,470
appearing team is working on

39
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:51,800
I don't do peering by the way I'm happy

40
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:57,590
to answer questions but I don't really

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:59,709
know anything about peering I'm not even

42
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,709
kidding

43
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:05,030
so we have a website for peers I think

44
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,500
it's peering that Google comm that will

45
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,568
have some information about this I think

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,068
I'm even a not a pointer to this slide

47
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:13,220
deck because my PR department would

48
00:02:10,068 --> 00:02:16,129
shoot me if they knew this well and

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,849
we'll have some updated information wow

50
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:18,829
I'm going fast

51
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:21,109
well something updated information for

52
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:23,300
actual peers on ISP a cool calm which is

53
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,310
the the portal that can be used to view

54
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,630
your current status ideally we'll be

55
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,650
able to tell you for all the routes as

56
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:29,569
you send us which

57
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:31,099
have or don't have IR coverage most

58
00:02:29,569 --> 00:02:34,640
people just say what you don't have so

59
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:37,280
that's the widget fix we're collecting

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,690
data from things like the IRR I have

61
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,720
been shocked over the years by how

62
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:43,819
horrible this entire system is and how

63
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,440
everybody has a crazy bespoke tool which

64
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,310
works for them I won't for anybody else

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,349
and then there's a bunch of tools like

66
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,610
IRR tool set that doesn't even compile I

67
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:56,089
don't even know what's up with that

68
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:59,000
BGP q3 is great but I can't actually use

69
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,329
that internally because it doesn't fit

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,040
into our crazy space world I could about

71
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,269
a local IRD that also doesn't work for

72
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,040
me because it doesn't fit into the crazy

73
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:08,599
space world I think a lot of the

74
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,548
problems that I have probably other

75
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,500
people have so I have to write a bunch

76
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:13,909
of tooling to make myself work I'm gonna

77
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,159
try and do it as generically as I can

78
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:17,599
and hopefully make it available I think

79
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,890
the next slide actually has to link oh

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,319
no it'll be later anyway

81
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:26,540
because somebody at Google invented is

82
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,760
open can big thing with some other

83
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,379
people I'm sure

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
Rob's happy about it I'm gonna have to

85
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:33,620
generate open config output or at least

86
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,030
some intermediary think it looks like up

87
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,840
and config so I'll probably do that in

88
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:42,019
the tooling that I'm building to publish

89
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,310
and ideally you could use that if you

90
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,319
were also doing up a good vague or it's

91
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:47,030
just it's a data structure so you can

92
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,349
build something else from that if

93
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,569
there's in fact there's a kid hub

94
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,010
repository at the near the end here if

95
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:53,540
you have questions or comments or you'd

96
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,099
like hey open could they get scrappy

97
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,819
please do this other thing let me know

98
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:59,569
we can talk about it

99
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:01,540
application I'm gonna put them on

100
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:04,849
routers shocker

101
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:06,560
okay so originally in Vancouver I said

102
00:04:04,849 --> 00:04:12,048
Merry Christmas I'm gonna feel to you at

103
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:15,079
Christmas Christmas moved to April I'm

104
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:17,510
gonna get presents and that ideally will

105
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,549
be dropping routes from you know they

106
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,029
don't match the filters by like

107
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:22,250
September

108
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,698
I think these dates are pretty decent to

109
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,169
think about if you aimed for September

110
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,340
as your final get all the data right

111
00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:29,990
that'd be perfect for me

112
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,950
hopefully I'll actually have stuff

113
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:36,380
implemented to work I have a couple

114
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,940
it doesn't say April first okay

115
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,490
yeah I also won't do it on Friday so

116
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,480
Mark Andrews won't come get me because I

117
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:47,210
got him so anyway the tooling the

118
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,490
manners folks at I sock offered up a

119
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,630
github repository we could use we

120
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,430
started putting some stuff in there

121
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:54,170
there's a library that we'll just all

122
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,070
written and go because I don't work

123
00:04:54,170 --> 00:05:00,890
makes me do that it download it will

124
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,030
parse an IR file database file today

125
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,159
it'll parse any of the ones that are

126
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,729
available there's a tool that I added

127
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,200
and it's waiting for review which should

128
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,910
actually parse a bunch of them all at

129
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,260
the same time and create structured data

130
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,330
the next step for me is to actually do

131
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,680
something with the structured data again

132
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,479
if you have comments or questions I'm

133
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,160
happy to answer them through github or

134
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,270
you could email me at whatever was my

135
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,310
email address in the beginning that's it

136
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,950
I have four and a half minutes if

137
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,850
anybody has questions

138
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:35,870
Ruettiger you seem like you want to ask

139
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:44,900
your question actually I have less of

140
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:50,150
questions for a Loki i from my exercises

141
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:53,659
impede in trying to filter peers I know

142
00:05:50,150 --> 00:06:01,429
there are quite a number work it does

143
00:05:53,660 --> 00:06:04,430
not work but well okay kind of you

144
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,980
select where you are applying and where

145
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:12,650
you figure it out to be feasible the

146
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:20,660
question of the tooling for analyzing

147
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:25,760
stuff is indeed crucial we have had guys

148
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:28,010
who work miracle of getting improvements

149
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:33,500
and additional function out of the

150
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:34,500
stinking evils of manure that has been

151
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,930
left as

152
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:45,330
our tool set and one of the tricks that

153
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:51,060
I find useful is actually generating the

154
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:54,479
results in the format of our PSL is very

155
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,900
helpful because that means that the tool

156
00:06:54,480 --> 00:07:00,990
can also in itself

157
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,890
yeah heat itself so you can you can run

158
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:08,930
multiple multiple cycles and actually

159
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:14,190
derive more interesting information and

160
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:18,870
my developers actually recently added a

161
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:23,430
few interesting filter and diagnostic

162
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:26,550
stuff like I can tell you what you have

163
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:31,260
in your IRA data that is rpki

164
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,780
invalid yeah right so that's that sort

165
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,340
of technology out at the backend seems

166
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,109
useful to me I don't know that I'm

167
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,489
certainly not gonna do with IR toolset I

168
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,970
seriously tried on three different

169
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:46,050
platforms no compile no luck you know

170
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:48,030
kind of as I say stinking heap of manual

171
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,229
yeah I had to build my own I'm perfectly

172
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:55,080
happy to share we are also like like to

173
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:57,690
share and we might we might actually do

174
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:04,500
something in Prague yeah something I

175
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:06,750
want to say there mr Gilmore yes a rogue

176
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,850
Hurricane electric once you start

177
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,890
filtering do you know when you

178
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,320
regenerate filters would that be a once

179
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:16,320
every day or every few hours yeah sorry

180
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,419
I think I covered that in the slide deck

181
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,430
I'm not gonna back up there's a bunch of

182
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:24,240
weird reasons that we have for any

183
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,850
global update takes four days so I can't

184
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,130
do anything across the board I think the

185
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,960
plan that we've been saying to people

186
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,809
and in the slides I think it says this

187
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,338
is that the ISP portal would give the

188
00:08:33,809 --> 00:08:37,799
opportunity for like hey I updated my

189
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,020
stuff click the button and then within

190
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,598
an hour we should be able to regather

191
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,679
the results and update devices so I

192
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:44,970
think that's kind of the plan we're

193
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,250
working toward if we get that of the

194
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,980
great but otherwise think about like I'm

195
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,680
updating filter

196
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:55,810
once a week anybody else no awesome you

197
