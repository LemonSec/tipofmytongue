1
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,780
good afternoon everyone hope hopefully

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,800
ready for the break here in a few

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,000
minutes but thank you for sticking

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:24,040
around so last Friday I wake up and I

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,080
open up Twitter and then less than 60

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,029
seconds after this tweet was sent I went

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,520
woohoo awesome this is like the most

8
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:33,580
amazing thing it kind of fits in really

9
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:36,730
well so what happened was ripe announced

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,320
this thing R is live and so I saw this I

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,860
said hey this is great this is gonna be

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:45,010
you know a really awesome thing to toy

13
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,530
with so you know that they've got their

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:49,989
website the the r is live thing they

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:51,609
they just launched over the weekend and

16
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:52,718
I think it's really important because I

17
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,699
think a lot of us have trouble

18
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,379
understanding what our external

19
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:59,620
visibility is of our network

20
00:00:56,379 --> 00:01:01,539
infrastructure you know it's it's

21
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,910
generally hard to kind of look at that

22
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:06,940
from all the places and ripe Riz has a

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:08,200
lot of views globally of that and the

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,750
most important thing is that this is

25
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:12,850
real time I've I've had a lot of scripts

26
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,700
where I go and I write write and I fetch

27
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:17,259
data from you know route views or you

28
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,030
know or somewhere else and go and

29
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,610
process that and this really makes it a

30
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,070
lot easier for for not only me as

31
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:26,110
somebody who's curious in what's going

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,149
on with the internet but also you know

33
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:29,619
for my employer understand ok what's

34
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:32,770
actually going on how are people going

35
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,689
selecting paths to our network so so

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,850
here's the important stuff it's still

37
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:39,548
experimental right basically is

38
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,169
soliciting input you know about this

39
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,240
it's a prototype but I think this is

40
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,219
super super valuable and I think you

41
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,960
should tell them that as well you should

42
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:48,880
go and check this out and go and look at

43
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,770
it I think that if you're not feeding

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,439
them you should absolutely be doing that

45
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:55,689
as well because there's talks like I

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,729
linked to here from right 72 where

47
00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:00,130
people will invisibly hijack your

48
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,840
network in your address space they'll

49
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:04,449
mail nounce it selectively it appears

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,920
over at IX or something and do spam runs

51
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:07,630
or something and it's really important

52
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,699
that you have a really good visibility

53
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,350
of what's going on with your address

54
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,640
space so you should definitely if you

55
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:15,340
haven't seen that talk you should also

56
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,720
check that out that but the service is

57
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,850
selective instead of going and

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,040
connecting to the full firehose of all

59
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:23,170
the bgp updates you can actually say hey

60
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,480
I would like to look at you know this

61
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,730
prefix this a s path I only want bgp

62
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,030
updates I only want withdraws so I

63
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,549
understand when

64
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,470
a network isn't no longer using my path

65
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:35,120
you can go and say I'd like to look at

66
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,100
their specific collectors and they also

67
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,930
don't have an option to dump in the raw

68
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,700
BGP message as well so if you want to go

69
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,000
into decipher that if you're trying to

70
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,989
debug either conformance issues or

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,090
you-you-you're you suspect somebody's

72
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,550
has some router that's you know has a

73
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,010
attribute parsing bug as we've seen over

74
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:53,180
the many years you can actually go in

75
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:56,030
and look at that and pull that raw

76
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,910
information out as well so how do you

77
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:01,400
make it happen I went and put together

78
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:03,950
about 60 lines of Python code real quick

79
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,020
to go and do that including you know

80
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,940
using a radix lookup to look at

81
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,550
everything which is great for finding

82
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,100
the more specific leaks that you might

83
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,870
see or hijacks of your address space you

84
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:18,950
can load in your customer prefixes and

85
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,600
and stuff I I went and I'm not super

86
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:23,359
sophisticated when it comes to Python so

87
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,739
I did it in less than an hour and then

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,720
you know you can go and tie it in with

89
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,270
whatever your workplace environment is

90
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,410
if it's slack or WebEx teams or

91
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:32,720
something like that and have it feed in

92
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,980
real-time information into your NOC or

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,070
your socks that are looking at these

94
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:39,350
things and the other thing I did is I

95
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:41,540
went and at Nanog 41 I gave this

96
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:45,769
lightning talk where I talked about how

97
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:47,060
I look for really weird routing leaks

98
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:48,560
where you're kind of fuzzing people's

99
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,510
policies where it's a customer of a

100
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,459
customer but you learn it from a transit

101
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:55,100
or a peer and you advertise it and so I

102
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:56,630
went I sat down and I reimplemented that

103
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,840
thing which has been running a cron

104
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,430
since 2007 which is really cool because

105
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,750
my codes been working for the most part

106
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:07,820
since 2007 but it's also delayed in that

107
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,670
and so and raipur is has a lot more

108
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,350
views than the route views dated that

109
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,030
I've been parsing over the years and it

110
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:15,620
makes it a lot of that much better so

111
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,668
some early results you know I went I

112
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,280
fetched out there you've got these

113
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:21,440
really cool a s paths that definitely

114
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,900
have things you know it's probably not

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,520
expected that China Telecom is going to

116
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,330
have three of their a s is right in the

117
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,909
middle of an a s path you know with with

118
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,859
different networks on each side those of

119
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,330
you who you don't like to look at these

120
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,060
things these a s paths are super

121
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,919
interesting just for the who's there and

122
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,029
why they're there and understanding okay

123
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,739
is this somebody trying to do some

124
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,110
route poisoning technique or something

125
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:47,459
else but a lot of the I know a lot of

126
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,829
the backbones have been trying to filter

127
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,119
out these types of techniques and these

128
00:04:49,829 --> 00:04:53,369
types of routes because sometimes I've

129
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:55,259
seen active data flowing over paths like

130
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:57,209
this and a lot of people maybe aren't

131
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:58,739
looking real closely at their ipv6 stuff

132
00:04:57,209 --> 00:05:01,139
so there's some software out there that

133
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:05,159
can use this already I put in the slides

134
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:07,799
a link to you know my little ugly repo

135
00:05:05,159 --> 00:05:11,639
up on github and stuff that I have that

136
00:05:07,799 --> 00:05:13,769
as well as the you know analog has this

137
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,069
BGP lawyer thing it cannot actually send

138
00:05:13,769 --> 00:05:19,709
you email alerts as well that they added

139
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:21,269
in there as a feature and then this

140
00:05:19,709 --> 00:05:23,219
whole thing has been done it you know

141
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:25,110
there's this Artemis software as well so

142
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,519
if you're really interesting interested

143
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,779
in monitoring what's going on with your

144
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:32,479
network you should also check that out

145
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,479
as well aside from that any questions

146
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:46,520
thanks Robert

147
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,520
Oh

148
00:05:51,180 --> 00:06:01,140
say I can invite you up here hello

149
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:04,500
yeah hi robert kiyosaki ripe ncc looks

150
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,979
awesome I will definitely try it out if

151
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,630
you have questions and suggestions for

152
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,480
improvement just talk to us will will

153
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:15,000
happy to listen yeah like I said thank

154

you this is I I've been super excited

155
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,720
with this and toying with it ever since

156
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:25,130
Friday morning it literally was TGIF fun

157
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:28,910
technology weekend no other questions

158
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:28,909
excellent thank you

159
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:37,069
