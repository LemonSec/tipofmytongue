1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:15,930
oh I

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,189
country fare and some of the technical

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:20,390
challenges that we've had with

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,070
communications there and in order to

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,689
understand the challenges you need to

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,349
understand what the Oregon Country Fair

7
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,960
is it's not your typical County Fair

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,570
with livestock auctions and it's ultra

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,800
world the Oregon Country Fair started

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,530
off as a Renaissance Fair in 1969 it's

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:44,930
located near Veneta Oregon about 15

12
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:49,020
miles west of Eugene and the main venue

13
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:53,070
is in a wooded area bounded on the east

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,540
by the long tom river and on the west is

15
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,210
where a lot of the parking and

16
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,970
infrastructure is it's known as the

17
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,310
eight because in the woods there is a

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,188
figure eight shaped path there it's

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,170
about 28 acres and this has grown

20
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:12,210
substantially over the 50 years that's

21
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:14,970
been in in operation is held on a

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:18,059
three-day weekend Friday Saturday and

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:22,289
Sunday gets about 22,000 visitors each

24
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,189
day and in addition to music and stages

25
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:29,130
and parades there are about 900 craft

26
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:32,158
booths selling various handcrafted

27
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,899
artifacts as well as food booths and

28
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,909
it's a it's a very elite type of crafts

29
00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:41,100
the anybody who wants to present there

30
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:45,749
has got to go through a peer-reviewed a

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,199
jury to approve their their crafts it's

32
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:53,490
non profit with with somewhat limited

33
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,999
funds and one of the problems is that

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:58,919
the eight parts of it flood when the

35
00:01:56,999 --> 00:02:01,348
longtime river overflows its banks in

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:04,200
the winter this is typically what it

37
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,179
looks like when the fair is open and

38
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,389
this is what it looks like in the winter

39
00:02:06,179 --> 00:02:08,389
time

40
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,589
those are the various crafts boots and

41
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,870
what have you so it makes a permanent

42
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:18,500
infrastructure a little bit difficult

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,430
there is no grid power in most of the of

44
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,690
the eight

45
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:25,790
there is grid power on the west side

46
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,520
Communications the staff extensively

47
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,920
uses two-way radio walkie-talkies with

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,530
repeaters there's a landline analog PBX

49
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,450
affectionately known as Tinkerbell that

50
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:40,760
has analog phones spread throughout the

51
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,970
area the with rewiring run through the

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,519
trees again very limited availability of

53
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,460
grid power and we have excellent

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,440
cellular service 362 days out of the

55
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:57,380
year as I mentioned we're a three-day

56
00:02:51,440 --> 00:03:00,290
festival the Internet is is supplied by

57
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,560
five bonded ADSL lines during the fair

58
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,120
that's basically all we can really get

59
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:08,180
there is no cable infrastructure to the

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,520
area and so that's what we're limited to

61
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,960
when the off hours we reduce that to two

62
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,420
and then during the fair we step that up

63
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:18,130
to five so we have a aggregate bandwidth

64
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,709
of about 20 Meg's to the entire facility

65
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:23,870
the cellular infrastructure is designed

66
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:27,950
for the nearby town of Vinita has about

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,360
4,500 people and most of the time those

68
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:31,130
people are going to be in their homes or

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,800
offices on their local Wi-Fi and not

70
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,290
using a cellular network when you take

71
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,260
22,000 visitors and put them in a 28

72
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:42,440
acre area served by one cell site the

73
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,060
cellular network basically melts you're

74
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,980
lucky to get one out of about four or

75
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,570
five phone calls through if you send a

76
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,190
text message you might get it anywhere

77
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,570
from 15 minutes to a couple of hours

78
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:55,070
later and just forget cellular data

79
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,829
there is a need for the staff to you

80
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:59,359
know to use internet wirelessly but the

81
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,760
primary problem that we're trying to

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,530
solve is the vendors that need

83
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,810
connectivity to process payment cards

84
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:11,570
the initial Wi-Fi deployment was which

85
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:14,030
set up several years ago as a 900

86
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:17,209
megahertz backbone between two hub

87
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,329
locations and seven different repeaters

88
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,620
located in trees we use nine hundred

89
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,729
Meg's because it penetrates

90
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:28,610
the foliage very well and then have I'm

91
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:32,719
the antenna in the tree that broadcasts

92
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:34,910
2.4 gig to the users and these are

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,440
powered by 12 volts storage batteries

94
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,600
basically a couple of large car

95
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,430
batteries at the base of the tree during

96
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,850
the fair hours and this has been in

97
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,680
place for the past several years there

98
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,229
you can see one of the trees and then a

99
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,470
close-up of the 2.4 gig antenna and you

100
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:56,570
can barely make out the dish near the

101
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:58,400
oval there and this this Wi-Fi serves

102
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,229
multiple uses during the public hours

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,669
again the vendor access to payment

104
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:04,070
processing is critical and that's

105
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,698
prioritized the vendors are on their own

106
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,260
password protected SSID the staff uses a

107
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:10,940
separate SSID over the same

108
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:14,419
infrastructure for administrative needs

109
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,940
and then during non-public hours we turn

110
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,349
up a third SSID for volunteers and

111
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:21,500
others just basically to use the

112
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:24,880
Internet the firewall and QoS is

113
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,450
controlled by pfSense routers at the hub

114
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,130
and over time the vendor needs for

115
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,180
processing payment cards have become

116
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:39,050
more and more critical the craft booths

117
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:42,979
are putting out some fairly expensive

118
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:45,169
items and more and more people are using

119
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:47,330
credit cards there's a limited

120
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:49,099
availability for ATMs they need to be

121
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,840
where the grid power is and they also

122
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:55,340
need communication there are a couple of

123
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,989
ATMs on site but they are on the west

124
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:58,969
edge where we have grid power and

125
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:03,050
they're connected by a wire line back to

126
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:05,240
the to the lek and what's happened in

127
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,340
the recent days is that small-business

128
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,380
merchant accounts are now much much

129
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,880
easier to get than they were in the old

130
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,740
days so everybody has got an cellphone

131
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,889
app with a stripe or a square reader

132
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,199
that reads the chip cards or stripe

133
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,960
customers are paying preferring to pay

134
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,639
by card and the offline transactions are

135
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,099
risky for the merchants because you

136
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:31,460
don't know if it's a it's a good card so

137
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:34,909
the driver for what we're trying to do

138
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,419
is to allow the merchants to process

139
00:06:34,909 --> 00:06:39,469
their payment

140
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,620
cards and one of the things we found is

141
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:46,640
that you give a merchant a password for

142
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:49,370
their SSID 4 for merchant processing and

143
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,490
when sales are slow there are streaming

144
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:54,860
YouTube and doing other things and that

145
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,850
tends to overwhelm our 20 megahertz or

146
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:01,100
20 megabit connection so even if the

147
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,070
vendors don't abuse it we have found

148
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:06,950
that cell phones are extremely chatty

149
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:09,200
and they're even more chatty on Wi-Fi

150
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,300
than they are on the cell network so all

151
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,400
these background apps refreshing people

152
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,750
trying to find out your location to send

153
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,710
you ads and what have you the cell

154
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:22,060
networks all of these apps on the on the

155
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:25,150
phones are creating quite a bit of noise

156
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,560
we started off using a whitelist and

157
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:29,359
surprisingly you can call up the various

158
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,070
payment processors and say hey what IP

159
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,560
addresses do you use and they're very

160
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,020
happy to tell you so we started off with

161
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,210
a whitelist of IPs of the well-known

162
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,940
payment processing and only allowed

163
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,870
those anything else was directed to a

164
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,180
static page it basically said go away

165
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:51,380
and the whitelist we found some issues

166
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:54,200
with the the primary well used payment

167
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,670
processors are all in there but

168
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,010
occasionally they might have part of

169
00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:00,170
their infrastructure that's served by a

170
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:02,980
CDN that might be the same CDN that's

171
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:06,650
serving other things that we don't want

172
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:10,100
so we've changed recently to a blacklist

173
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:13,190
where essentially we have opened up the

174
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:16,250
vendor network and we're running a net

175
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:19,490
stat looking at the top talkers and then

176
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:22,100
as we find the abusers we throw those

177
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,490
into the blacklist and route those to

178
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,400
our static page and this seems to be

179
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:31,340
working well and is scalable as more and

180
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,319
more as we start to reduce the noise the

181
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,130
other ones start to start to bubble up

182
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,660
and of course every year we discovered

183
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,460
that there are new apps and new things

184
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,120
that we need to put on the on the

185
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:46,370
blacklist the drawbacks of the current

186
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,990
wireless system it works very well for

187
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:53,190
staff use outside of public our

188
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:55,379
but being 2.4 with 22,000 visitors on

189
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:59,149
site a lot of them are running ad hoc

190
00:08:55,379 --> 00:09:01,709
networks that are trying to to tether

191
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:03,959
devices to the very very poorly

192
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:05,670
performing cellular network and so

193
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,819
there's quite a bit of noise in the 2.4

194
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:11,128
gig band we also have what's called the

195
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:14,729
hidden node problem so when you put a

196
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:19,110
repeater high up in a tree it's looking

197
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:20,579
at a large area of the fair and so it

198
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,240
sees all of these low to the ground

199
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:26,699
radios but they may not see each other

200
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:31,949
so if you have a radio a user with a

201
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:35,910
radio that is interfering with will

202
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:37,800
interfere with another user because it

203
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,110
doesn't see that other user and know

204
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,930
that the channel is busy there are some

205
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,449
protocols within Wi-Fi to try to limit

206
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:48,019
this hidden node problem but it's not

207
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:50,969
perfect and during the public hours

208
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:54,329
these seven repeaters tend to get

209
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,370
overwhelmed the other problem is that it

210
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,170
is a wooded area the foliage causes dead

211
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,149
spots and it a Grove AIT's this hidden

212
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,310
node problem you might be right under a

213
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:03,480
repeater about the trees block you and

214
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,479
so you're connecting to one that's

215
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,550
further away and then labour-intensive

216
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,040
having to go out to these various

217
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:14,189
repeater sites and change the batteries

218
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,399
periodically as they get depleted is is

219
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:19,949
a problem so the problems we need to

220
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,819
solve 2.4 gig wide area radios are not

221
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:25,949
usable and we really need to reduce the

222
00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:28,370
coverage area per access point which

223
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:31,709
results in obviously needing many more

224
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:34,170
access points we've looked at five gigs

225
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:36,809
the five gig band is now available on

226
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,639
virtually all of the modern smartphones

227
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:42,509
and devices that are used for payment

228
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,309
processing and the foliage limits the

229
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,350
range substantially which can be a good

230
00:10:44,309 --> 00:10:47,939
thing for us because the limited range

231
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:50,220
means that you're not going to have as

232
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:52,379
much of a hidden node problem in that

233
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:57,540
the radios will only talk to a small

234
00:10:52,379 --> 00:11:00,700
area in 2016 on the west end of the fair

235
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:04,030
area we deployed a pilot project where

236
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:09,340
we did have grid power available and ran

237
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:12,760
three five gigahertz radios connected

238
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:15,400
back to via wired Ethernet back to the

239
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,640
hub and this worked very very well the

240
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,949
people in that area were able to access

241
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,890
the Internet and get their credit cards

242
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:26,440
processed so the small low to the ground

243
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:29,050
five gigahertz project did show some

244
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,930
promise but did not solve the problem of

245
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:35,880
power and being able to extend this

246
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,530
network into the rest of the area and

247
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,850
surprisingly the cable companies and

248
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,040
those of you who are in the cable

249
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,760
business this is going to be old hat to

250
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:48,660
you but they Co 75 ohm coax cable

251
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,450
backbone that's used by cable providers

252
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:55,600
has a very interesting feature in that

253
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,580
in the field and the cable there are

254
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,130
amplifiers that are needed to take this

255
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,780
signal a long ways and those amplifiers

256
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,970
need to be powered and they're typically

257
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:07,060
in the middle of nowhere and a span on a

258
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:09,070
telephone pole or something so what the

259
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:13,540
cable people do is they have a power

260
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:15,190
supply that injects AC voltage onto the

261
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:18,040
cable

262
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:20,050
it's very wideband we created these

263
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,000
devices called anode which is

264
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:25,060
essentially rather than using the power

265
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,110
to power a trunk amplifier or a fiber to

266
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:32,199
coaxial converter we use that cable

267
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:35,410
power to light up a box that can handle

268
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:38,470
the access points this eliminates the

269
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,360
need for swapping batteries the cable

270
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,570
plant is designed to be environmentally

271
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,400
rugged it's out in the rain for years

272
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:50,200
and it's expandable by either tapping

273
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:52,329
the cable line or extending it at the

274
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,580
head end or the hub we have what's

275
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:57,250
called a cmts router which is a cable

276
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,890
modem termination system that converts

277
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:03,040
our Ethernet to coax and the way this

278
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:06,040
works is the high frequency which is a

279
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,170
legacy from the analog television

280
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,670
networks anything basically above 54

281
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,579
megahertz on the cable is used

282
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,990
downstream from the hub to the nodes

283
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:16,150
into the radios

284
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:18,940
and then lower frequency than that is

285
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,500
being is used for the upstream data at

286
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,410
the head end there's a device called a

287
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:26,170
diplexer which combines these high and

288
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,880
low frequencies onto the cable and then

289
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:30,250
there's a power injector which has an

290
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,860
isolated 90 volts AC that's fed down the

291
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:34,270
cable in the field when we want to drop

292
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,910
a node there's a device called a

293
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:39,310
directional tap and this is again

294
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,560
standard cable technology this takes a

295
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,510
small amount of the signal and routes

296
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,390
that to the node sends the rest down the

297
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:48,819
line and it also optionally can provide

298
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,830
the AC power at the end of the line

299
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,170
there's a terminating resistor basically

300
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,790
to avoid reflections and and nasty

301
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,910
things that can happen with RF when you

302
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,589
have a nun terminated line this is

303
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,219
basically what the system looks like

304
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,620
schematically the red arrows are the

305
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,670
downstream data coming from the internet

306
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:11,380
going out to the customer radios and the

307
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,500
blue is upstream coming from the

308
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,620
customer radios back to the to the

309
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,240
internet power is injected with the with

310
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,100
the green line from the power injector

311
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,560
the items on the left hand of the screen

312
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,200
are at the hub and then those at the

313
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:29,739
right hand of the screen are out in the

314
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,900
field so each area node is powered from

315
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,780
the cable trunk line yet then basically

316
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,230
has a power inserter working in Reverse

317
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:41,260
to strip this 90 volts from the cable

318
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,140
line before passing it to the to the

319
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,210
cable modem there's an auto transformer

320
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,970
that is used to step that 90 volts back

321
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:53,170
of a 220 to power the gear within the

322
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:55,920
mode the node and the because the cable

323
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,300
plant is designed to power hundreds of

324
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,150
cable modems and we're only typically

325
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:03,459
having less than 10 on a device the RF

326
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:05,740
levels are extremely high so we put an

327
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,270
attenuator and to bring the radio

328
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,700
frequency levels down to what's

329
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,920
appropriate for that node and the value

330
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:15,070
of that that attenuator depends on how

331
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,540
far away from the hub we go those that

332
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,810
are close we reduced a signal quite a

333
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,719
bit and then as the cable attenuation it

334
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,339
is extended and as we're dropping more

335
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,410
power from other nodes we reduce the

336
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,810
value of that attenion

337
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:30,689
to the appropriate value for the modem

338
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:34,439
and then also within the node is a Power

339
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,360
over Ethernet router that is used to

340
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,350
deliver the power and the data to the

341
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,899
radios and each node can have up to four

342
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,569
radios that can be extended the typical

343
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:47,370
hundred meter distance of Ethernet from

344
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:52,170
that node and these are directional five

345
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:53,850
gigahertz access points schematically

346
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:56,279
this is what the node looks like we have

347
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:58,439
the cable coming in take that power

348
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:00,389
inserter and reverse run that through

349
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:02,449
the auto transformer and that's used to

350
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:06,089
power the cable modem and the router and

351
00:16:02,449 --> 00:16:09,779
then the signal is converted from the

352
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:11,699
cable modem back to Ethernet lights up

353
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:14,490
the router which then powers the radios

354
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:18,990
and each node with for radios pulls

355
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:21,089
about 70 watts with the 90 Meg at 10

356
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:25,829
amps we can run up to 10 nodes little

357
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:27,329
over 10 nodes on a cable line this is

358
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:30,569
basically what the node looks like

359
00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:33,120
internally the cables coming in on the

360
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:37,829
upper right the power injector or power

361
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:39,449
stripper is then applied you see the red

362
00:16:37,829 --> 00:16:41,279
and white wires coming there the auto

363
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:43,979
transformer and that then powers the

364
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,329
cable modem and the router and then we

365
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,449
have the ethernet out going to the

366
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:51,930
radios this is in a NEMA 4x box that is

367
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:55,560
weatherproof and this is what one looks

368
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:57,540
like deployed out in the field you can

369
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,000
see the directional coupler and the node

370
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:02,490
box out in the field this particular one

371
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,990
happens to be at the end of the line so

372
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:09,900
you'll see that device on the right hand

373
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:12,089
lower right-hand side is the terminating

374
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,480
resistor so we found that this

375
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:20,539
technology really works to deliver Wi-Fi

376
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,539
to a small area and is extendable and

377
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:26,099
here is that same shot that we saw

378
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,130
earlier and if you look at the circle

379
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:31,860
there that's one of our stealth radios

380
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,200
these are ubiquity access points that

381
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,149
we've camouflaged we don't generally

382
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,190
like to advertise the technology to the

383
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:39,629
people at the fair so it's it's we

384
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:44,130
try to keep it stealth but on the other

385
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,810
hand make it usable so in the future

386
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:49,920
we're gonna expand the cable nodes

387
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:52,230
adding more as we go along finally we

388
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,720
are able to get some real broadband to

389
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,970
the fair at not surf that's going to be

390
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,500
fibre or coax but we should be able to

391
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,700
get in the hundred megabit downstream

392
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,970
hoping to have that for the 50th

393
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:09,720
anniversary coming up this July and we

394
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:12,210
continue to tune the firewall and QoS as

395
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,140
we try to filter out everything other

396
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:20,130
than payment cards on the vendor Network

397
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:23,940
presently we've got a second-hand cable

398
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:27,960
router the cmts and it is using a card

399
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,830
that is only capable of a single channel

400
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:35,150
as docsis 2.0 and that gives us

401
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:40,290
basically a maximum of 35 megabits per

402
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:43,080
cable and now that DOCSIS 3.1 is out I'm

403
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:45,750
hoping that the 88v cards that support

404
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,850
DOCSIS 3.0 with wider bandwidth will

405
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,590
drop in price before the fair this year

406
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,379
and we can just basically drop that in

407
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,649
and get some more bandwidth so this

408
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:58,850
seems to be working very well and that's

409
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:02,270
what we're looking forward going forward

410
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,270
are there any questions

411
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,400
i am jeff has imagine uber question for

412
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,980
you about your list did you consider

413
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,150
just simply rate limiting the traffic so

414
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,429
instead of trying to play whack-a-mole

415
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,110
with all the addresses just crank it

416
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,850
down so they only had trickled traffic

417
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,949
through the credit card processing would

418
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:25,178
behave perfectly fine and minute they

419
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,230
try streaming their to be so unhappy

420
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:29,140
with their go to stop it

421
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:31,630
we looked into that a little bit the

422
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,910
problem is that again we're limited to a

423
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:36,610
maximum of 20 megabits per second for

424
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:39,429
everything and the background apps on

425
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:43,418
the cell phones even though it's per

426
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:45,039
user is relatively small that noise is

427
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,200
just there all the time and keep in mind

428
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,320
we've got roughly 900 vendors that are

429
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,240
using this in this small area so it just

430
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,480
made more sense to us to to basically

431
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,340
knock down the the top talkers of the

432
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,760
you know the Netflix YouTube the

433
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:03,010
Facebook and what have you and as they

434
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,539
pop up and we see oh look now this is

435
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,809
the new top talker that is getting

436
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:11,919
through and we we add that so it's it's

437
00:20:07,809 --> 00:20:14,200
difficult to do that in in just because

438
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,460
there's so much and it's so varied every

439
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,289
single app that's got a background

440
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:22,240
refresh is going somewhere else

441
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:23,919
okay thank you hi Rob see strim I used

442
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,620
to work for really big cable company and

443
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,840
now I don't anymore okay this is really

444
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:31,299
cute I like this and one of the things I

445
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,850
noticed is the looks like you used RG 11

446
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:35,408
and not cable hardline because you don't

447
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,209
have a really long plant and that's

448
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:38,860
that's nice because it means you don't

449
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,409
need special weird tooling or anything

450
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:43,209
and you can keep the costs in check

451
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:46,809
because hardline is really expensive

452
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,090
yeah the RG 11 going through the trees

453
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:51,580
it's a lot easier if you kink that hard

454
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,889
line it's a problem and that was near

455
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,740
the end of the path we are deploying

456
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,720
this year some half-inch hard line which

457
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,890
has got a 14 gauge Center conductor as

458
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,090
opposed to the 16 gauge on the RG 11

459
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,780
again with the frequencies that we're

460
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:10,539
using we we have we don't really need a

461
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,710
lot of so so yeah that was one of the

462
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,390
things I was going to point out is you

463
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:15,820
managed to keep your downstream channel

464
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,470
somewhere you know low yes exactly

465
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,350
traditionally people find it up around

466
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,120
600 right well because that was

467
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:24,090
place that was already open when you

468
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,250
went out beyond the five table yeah

469
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:27,600
there's no local TV channel 4 so that's

470
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:31,049
what we're young for our downstream and

471
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,909
that also so yeah so that that brings me

472
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,440
to a point I'm hoping that somebody will

473
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:39,960
not hop in line and tell me that my

474
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:42,450
memory is completely nuts but if you I'm

475
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,059
thinking back to the days but before doc

476
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:46,890
says 300 actually rolled out I think you

477
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:48,840
as long as you keep your upstream

478
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,380
separate in your downstream separate you

479
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:56,250
may be able to get away with running to

480
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:58,950
d3 Oh cards into the same cable plant in

481
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:01,470
parallel and having the when the modems

482
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,820
range having them stochastically joined

483
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,650
to one or the other

484
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:07,439
we haven't tried that we haven't needed

485
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:09,960
it again the the overall bandwidth to

486
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,240
the entire facility is less than we can

487
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,549
get on a single six megahertz TV channel

488
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,750
yeah I hear you but you're gonna begin

489
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:17,580
we're going to be reading in we're going

490
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:20,039
to be getting fiber and the asked I

491
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:21,990
checked the d3o stuff was still actually

492
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:23,490
a little pricey compared to it is I'm

493
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:31,409
hoping three one who will arrive that

494
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:38,220
price down awesome Thank You Julie um

495
00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:40,289
two questions like there's some kind of

496
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,780
rural over build that eventually gets

497
00:22:40,289 --> 00:22:49,340
fiber connectivity out to Vinita I

498
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:52,940
suppose is that something you see is

499
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:57,860
making this sort of facility easier like

500
00:22:52,940 --> 00:23:00,360
is a CenturyLink or quest actually like

501
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,120
building facilities out to places where

502
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,830
you need them or is that not something

503
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,780
that's a well that's what's happening

504
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,580
that's why let's weigh we're thinking

505
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,610
this year we've actually placed an order

506
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:15,299
to get connectivity getting fiber

507
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,649
connectivity to our infrastructure is

508
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:19,200
something that we're very much looking

509
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,600
forward to but again running fiber out

510
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,990
to the facilities where the people are

511
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,908
we still have the power problem yeah so

512
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,809
what this seems to be a good compromise

513
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:32,710
of the ability to do that I might add

514
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,769
that the cellular people

515
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:37,360
did put up a couple of cell on wheels

516
00:23:34,769 --> 00:23:40,059
AT&T and t-mobile came out put up cell

517
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,590
on wheels for this event and that helped

518
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:43,990
some but there was still pretty much

519
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,820
overwhelmed so they do microwave

520
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,309
backhaul for those I don't know what

521
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,249
they're using for they maybe microwave I

522
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:54,100
don't know yeah the other thing that

523
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:56,830
looked really cool here is like you you

524
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,049
have a stable of crusty old radio

525
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:02,949
engineers I think a Chabad maybe the

526
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:05,679
crusty asjuan yes yes you've essentially

527
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:07,919
used the technology that is mostly

528
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,840
compatible with their view of the world

529
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,330
which you know that's definitely

530
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,908
leveraging your strengths there yeah the

531
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,879
that we do try to hide the technology

532
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:20,710
from the from the fair goers but there

533
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:23,350
are a lot of high tech geeks that are

534
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:28,509
part of the of the infrastructure of the

535
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:31,389
fair yep at the volunteers Adam Mills

536
00:24:28,509 --> 00:24:33,669
from roblox I had a question about how

537
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:37,178
many you mentioned that there are modems

538
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:39,039
and routers and then the antennas how

539
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:41,139
many of those devices are you currently

540
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,840
managing I saw that you're using the

541
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:49,479
ubiquity P we do you leverage their

542
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:52,090
automation for that like their unify no

543
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,240
actually we we flashed the radios with

544
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:58,149
open worked so we're not we're not using

545
00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:01,480
the ubiquity radio configuration we're

546
00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:04,959
using open work and that allows us to in

547
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,700
an automated manner push changes to the

548
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,860
radio such as changed in the passwords

549
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:12,429
enabling or disabling the SSID is

550
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,320
outside of the public areas so how many

551
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,299
do you have currently deployed we get

552
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,279
well this we have the seven repeaters

553
00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:19,899
and then we have three nodes that each

554
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:23,139
one of which has three radios and the

555
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:28,840
other two have four radios and this year

556
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:29,830
we'll be adding more okay thank you very

557
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,889
much

558
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,889
you

559
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,290
you
