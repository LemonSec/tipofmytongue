1
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:16,250
so welcome to my talk I'd like to talk

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,410
about next generation black following to

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,660
counter DDoS attacks so this is actually

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,550
the full title my name is Chris or

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:24,980
actually Christophe diesel and I go by

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:30,320
Chris and this is joint work with Matias

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:33,140
George juice and onion so as many in

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,120
this room faced the issue of DDoS

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,190
attacks right and particularly we

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,650
speaking about volumetric DDoS attacks

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:45,410
and I just put the records observed and

12
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,750
publicly reported by media peak traffic

13
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:52,339
of DDoS attacks within the past four

14
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:54,519
years on this slide and we see in 2015

15
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,170
back then it was like 200 gigabytes I

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,180
digged up the news and media reports

17
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,850
about it it was a big thing it's like

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:05,149
200 gigabits oh hell what can we do

19
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:07,700
what's happening and just a year later

20
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:12,530
we had a new record of one terabyte per

21
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:14,780
second peak and then 1.7 so new record

22
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,329
again and it was always big in the media

23
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,569
and we know this is a growing issue

24
00:01:17,329 --> 00:01:22,788
however it's not only really the peaks

25
00:01:20,569 --> 00:01:25,609
and the publicly reported ones but

26
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:27,380
actually we're facing a lot of attacks

27
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:30,439
in our daily businesses right like on a

28
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,189
weekly basis nowadays 100 gigabits that

29
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:38,859
10 gigabits 50 gigabytes so also a lot a

30
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:42,279
high frequency of a lot smaller ones and

31
00:01:38,859 --> 00:01:45,889
since this is not an entirely new topic

32
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:48,829
there is a is PD dose defense toolbox so

33
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:50,929
we have tools to defend those dealer of

34
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:54,949
the text to mitigate them or to get

35
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:59,359
around them one actually fairly old way

36
00:01:54,950 --> 00:02:01,630
to do it is by using ACLs so I don't

37
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:05,749
know what's going on with the slides so

38
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:09,139
actually it allows arbitrary granularity

39
00:02:05,749 --> 00:02:10,728
of filters but the issue is it's a bit

40
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,738
vendor specific because each vendor

41
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:14,750
implements those in a different way and

42
00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,250
since the implementation is different

43
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,130
the configuration is different and that

44
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,200
scalability is different so if you

45
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:23,000
come from Nokia and go to Cisco you

46
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,619
cannot just assume that it works the

47
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,030
same way in particularly with

48
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,250
scalability yeah at the edges so if you

49
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,290
use it really a lot and it's a per

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,390
device configuration most cases if you

51
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:38,030
use configuration proxies and automated

52
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:39,679
systems that's not entirely true but in

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,890
general if your network operator you

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,310
need to configure those on a per device

55
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:48,649
say me in best case semi-automated way

56
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:50,870
so traffic scrubbing services became

57
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,570
we're way more popular over the past

58
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,270
years so this is actually the carefree

59
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:58,160
service the carefree product so if you

60
00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:00,320
hit by a DDoS attack you go to a traffic

61
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,690
scrubbing service they will clean your

62
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,299
traffic and redirect it towards you this

63
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:09,470
is usually done with the BGP there are

64
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:11,660
on demand and always-on kinds of

65
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,940
products always-on means they basically

66
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:16,609
are sort of your CDN and hosting your

67
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:18,650
stuff versus the on-demand where they're

68
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:22,010
really using BGP redirect the traffic

69
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:24,320
clean it and send it back to you so over

70
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,540
the past years we saw a standardization

71
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,840
and implementation of BGP flowspec this

72
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:32,090
is within BGP so it's a feature of BGP

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,850
basically and it allow us to configure

74
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,430
rules at neighbour networks so meaning I

75
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:41,049
can configure rules on the device

76
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,090
through BGP at my peers router and

77
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,130
traffic can be discarded at one vote

78
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:48,490
away at my neighbor's router already

79
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:52,220
filters are allowed at arbitrary

80
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:54,890
granularity and cooperation is required

81
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,630
because I cannot simply use it my

82
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,820
neighbor has to activate it and has me

83
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,380
has to allow me to really use this

84
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,250
feature so it requires the cooperation

85
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,890
in a sense the old good old remote

86
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:09,080
trigger plaque holding or a black holing

87
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:12,290
it's a very easy and straightforward way

88
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,260
of bgp or using bgp to configure routes

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:17,690
at another neighbor network in contrast

90
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:20,570
to flowspec which is also based bgp

91
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:22,940
based it does not allow filters on a

92
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:26,200
buret rarey kernel arity actually just

93
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:30,020
allows filters on IP granularity meaning

94
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,630
traffic to what IP can be discarded so

95
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:36,320
in best case IP or IP prefix

96
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,980
and it also requires cooperation not as

97
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,090
direct as in the sense of flowspec but

98
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,910
the neighbor has to adjust its

99
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,820
configuration to accept / 32 black

100
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:50,120
holing announcements and 2 to be honored

101
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:55,250
then so now we know there is a toolbox

102
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,860
of more or less good defense tools but

103
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:01,340
if we're asking how would we actually do

104
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,980
DDoS defense at ixps as of today so we

105
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:07,219
know all those tools and we know the

106
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,770
limitations but also with with which

107
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,840
advantages they actually coming so our

108
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,349
idea is let's combine the good

109
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,049
properties of the existing solutions and

110
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,820
eradicate the current shortcomings and

111
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,300
another plus is we can do this at the

112
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:26,290
IXP and the IXP as of now offer services

113
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,970
200 of a SS at the same time meaning

114
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,190
they don't have to connect to a new

115
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,250
network or have a new contract or have a

116
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,290
new set up it just works within the

117
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,850
environment of the XP or should work in

118
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:43,250
the environment of next P and X psi of T

119
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:46,490
day multiple of terabytes capacity spare

120
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:48,980
capacity right so the capacity to absorb

121
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,610
large DDoS attacks is in place already

122
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,380
and I expressed it part of the

123
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,500
interconnection internet community

124
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:59,719
already so if you continue to think

125
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:02,150
about it we first need to recap quickly

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,550
what does black holing actually do today

127
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,289
I assume that most in the room know what

128
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,630
it is and how it works so I just quickly

129
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,310
recap what's going on so on the left

130
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:12,620
hand side you can see the control plane

131
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,170
picture on the right hand side is a data

132
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,830
plane picture and what actually happens

133
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:21,110
on the control plane is there's a so

134
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,180
there's a XP end to the XP we see three

135
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:27,470
a SS connected as one two and three and

136
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:30,320
a s1 host is hosting a service behind

137
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:32,270
the dedicated IP address it announces

138
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,140
2/24 towards the route server and the

139
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:39,650
route server propagates the announcement

140
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:43,760
towards a s 2 & 3 so both a SS can reach

141
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:46,099
a s1 so in the next step we focus on the

142
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,670
data plane and actually it's the same

143
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,890
set up

144
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:51,110
and there are users sending traffic from

145
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,750
as2 and three torts of the service and

146
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:56,120
consuming it now let's just assume

147
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,300
there's an attacker using a ntp

148
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:01,640
reflection amplification attack and

149
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,460
traffic is coming over the two ASSA s2

150
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,520
and s3 across the IXP towards the

151
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,789
service of a s1 and the issue here is

152
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,080
that it's a DDoS attack and it's

153
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:15,020
consuming more resources than actually

154
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,300
available and as a result either the XP

155
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,190
port the internal network or the service

156
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:25,010
just goes down so we have a denial of

157
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:27,200
service here and next step is for the m2

158
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,230
mitigated with the XP based black holing

159
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,810
a simple change we just changed or add

160
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:36,260
another announcement just the IP address

161
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,750
of the service with a community to black

162
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:41,210
all the traffic a s1 could just send it

163
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,370
towards rot server and they're all

164
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,700
server itself it's propagating it again

165
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:50,140
like same scenario however in this case

166
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,789
since it's a slash 32 it is not

167
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:57,050
guaranteed that it's actually accepted

168
00:07:52,790 --> 00:08:00,080
so in this toy example actually a s2 is

169
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,350
only accepting it meaning honoring it an

170
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,849
s3 does not so the effect on the data

171
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:10,730
plane is that the traffic is discarded

172
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:14,000
but just the traffic from a s2 right so

173
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:16,880
ingress ixp it is discarded and traffic

174
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,560
from s3 attack traffic is still getting

175
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:23,180
through and for the users in a s2 they

176
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,310
can't really reach the service anymore

177
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,150
so it's sort of supported the denial of

178
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:31,010
service and a s3 it's unclear and it's

179
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,380
not predictable what's actually going on

180
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,569
in some instances customers report ok

181
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,950
it's really helping us and they can

182
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:39,890
still consume the service in other

183
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:43,610
instances they still are under denial of

184
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:47,590
service so let's focus a bit on those

185
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:52,070
limitations which are very obvious so

186
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:54,170
actually blocks the the XP based black

187
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,670
holing blocks unwanted and wanted

188
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,790
traffic at the same time right in the

189
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,498
instance of a s2 so it just doesn't

190
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,009
discriminate it just block

191
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:05,959
all the traffic towards this last 32 and

192
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:07,519
it's hard to predict behavior because we

193
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:11,449
don't know beforehand who is going to

194
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,489
honor the / 32 and who is not even and

195
00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:16,579
even if we would know it's we don't know

196
00:09:13,489 --> 00:09:19,419
beforehand from which networks the

197
00:09:16,579 --> 00:09:22,189
attacks coming into our network right so

198
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:25,249
it's it's just hard to predict and we

199
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:27,889
can't really count on it and the last

200
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:30,889
thing is on a subset of pairings as a

201
00:09:27,889 --> 00:09:32,479
result it has just no effect so the

202
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:34,819
benign traffic is still going through

203
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:37,039
but also the attack traffic so we don't

204
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:38,959
experience this and to really understand

205
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,639
the limitations of the black holing and

206
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:43,909
how we would need to design a new system

207
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:50,179
we dig a bit deeper into those

208
00:09:43,909 --> 00:09:52,519
limitations so on this slide we just did

209
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:55,249
measurement analysis on a DDoS attack

210
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,729
that happened at the IXP we are looking

211
00:09:55,249 --> 00:10:02,509
in this plot at relative traffic shares

212
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:05,449
of a 40 gigabit ethernet XP port from

213
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,009
one member and the ingress ingress

214
00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:11,779
traffic all the traffic that goes toward

215
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:14,709
this customer and we see that at twenty

216
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:19,009
past twenty it happens that there is a

217
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:21,529
memcached attack on port 11 to 11 and

218
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:23,659
this is the red part of the plot and we

219
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:25,819
see before the this attack happens

220
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:27,739
actually it's mostly web traffic and

221
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:30,319
then with the beginning of the attack

222
00:10:27,739 --> 00:10:33,079
the distribution significantly changes

223
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:35,929
and we see a lot of attack traffic red

224
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,498
however we still see a significant share

225
00:10:35,929 --> 00:10:41,720
of web traffic about 30% and if we use

226
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:44,389
black holing in this instance and as has

227
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:48,379
happened in this incident actually all

228
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:50,059
the traffic is discarded so as a result

229
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:52,220
we have some sort of collateral damage

230
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:55,939
because actually the 30 percent of the

231
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,889
traffic yeah would still be there and

232
00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:02,539
it'd still be 9 traffic so the next

233
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:04,699
limitation we're focusing a bit is black

234
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:07,279
hole is all or nothing approach so it

235
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:08,299
has prefix tranel arity so drop it or

236
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,640
don't drop it

237
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:17,180
and actually you can do a per peers

238
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,590
election not discarding traffic from all

239
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,910
your neighbors but you can select

240
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:25,850
subsets at an IXP however it's still

241
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:28,520
very very coarse-grained so for this we

242
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:31,190
did a measurement analysis on the black

243
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,740
hole traffic at the XP of a week and

244
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,850
just looked what traffic actually gets

245
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,710
black holes at an IXP

246
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,350
and we compared it with a regular

247
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:43,300
traffic we observe and we see that those

248
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:47,930
are the most common amplification attack

249
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:51,229
protocols right so it's ntp it's LD a PE

250
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:53,930
it's memcached it's all this stuff and

251
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:57,790
we see that compared to the benign

252
00:11:53,930 --> 00:12:00,260
traffic it's very significant share so

253
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:06,620
actually the conclusion here is we just

254
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:08,540
need more granularity so for the final

255
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,280
measurement study we did we actually

256
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,740
wanted to see from a user perspective

257
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,860
how does black holing behave so how

258
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,630
ineffective can it be so what happens if

259
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,520
not everyone is honoring our black

260
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,620
holing announcement and therefore we

261
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,170
went to a Buddhist service and bought a

262
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:27,560
DDoS attack towards our servers and our

263
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,660
a.s and we bought it and then we

264
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:33,949
launched the attack we ran it for 10

265
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,209
minutes and was the NTP attack and we

266
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,670
just did it over the multilateral

267
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,200
peering at the XP so no bilateral

268
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,900
peering just the multilateral appearing

269
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:46,840
at the XP road server and 10 minute

270
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:49,670
attack to a / 32 prefix and then we

271
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:52,220
after half attack we activated black

272
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:55,520
holing and actually we see in the first

273
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:59,030
place that traffic came in from about 40

274
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,430
peers right so the blue blue dots in in

275
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,939
the white part of the plot and then and

276
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:06,530
traffic levels between 600 and 800

277
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,420
megabits per second and then the crepe

278
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:10,880
art is actually when we activated black

279
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,870
holding and the result is in this case

280
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,730
well it does not really discard a very

281
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,240
significant share of traffic right it

282
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:22,790
reduces by let's say 100 megabits maybe

283
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,640
200 megabits and it's coming from a

284
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:27,079
smaller number of peers just 26 but what

285
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,800
we are seeing here is

286
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:32,750
a good chunk of the peers that sending

287
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,689
the ddos traffic ignoring the black

288
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:38,450
holing requests by not honoring the / 32

289
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:41,030
announcement from Ras and the conclusion

290
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:43,430
here is the signal signaling is too

291
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,860
complex so if we always need to involve

292
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:50,599
everyone at the IXP it's just too hard

293
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:53,570
to make a significant impact so actually

294
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,680
the requirements for an advanced black

295
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:59,270
holing are we need better granularity so

296
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:03,530
fine grade filtering source destination

297
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:06,500
had a fuels arbitrary field so source IP

298
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:11,270
destination IP okay but even more

299
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:15,980
detailed like UDP TCP or the layer 4

300
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:19,790
transport port transport ports so we

301
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,860
need reduce signaling complexity so it

302
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:24,230
should be easy to use short setup times

303
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,300
it just should feel like the black

304
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,430
holing we are using today so we don't

305
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,219
want to change the system's invent a

306
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:34,069
very huge API or something along these

307
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,250
lines and the level of cooperation

308
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:39,800
should be lowered so we don't want to

309
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,020
involve any parties at the ISP as proven

310
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,719
by the remote triggered black holing

311
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,420
might be ineffective so we want to have

312
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,160
some telemetry so we really want to know

313
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,990
at any point in time what's going on as

314
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,650
from a customer perspective I want to

315
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:58,580
see how much traffic is discarded and to

316
00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:01,220
which filters or - yeah actually

317
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,710
which part on which filter yum is

318
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,930
discarded at the i-x and we want to have

319
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,280
scalability right so we just don't want

320
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,979
to have it for small attacks or the

321
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:12,050
super big ones we want to have the same

322
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,300
performance that same number of filters

323
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,630
we want to have a short reaction time

324
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:21,170
and actually no complex configuration

325
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:23,750
and if possible we want to meet all the

326
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:25,430
above requirements with a minimal invest

327
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,860
so we don't want to buy traffic

328
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:31,959
scrubbing boxes or invent new services

329
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:34,610
or invest in new infrastructure and

330
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:38,930
actually the idea or the proposal we

331
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:40,550
have is fairly simple but effective so

332
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:45,079
the same scenario

333
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:48,430
from before and again a / 32 announced

334
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:52,250
from s1 towards the route server but

335
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:56,390
encoded in the BGP community is a

336
00:15:52,250 --> 00:16:00,230
reference to a very specifically defined

337
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:02,390
filter and in the case of the NTP attack

338
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,290
it's just please drop all traffic

339
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:10,819
towards the IP of my service that has

340
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:13,430
the NTP port and this signal goes from

341
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,560
the route server directly to the data

342
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:19,780
plane so not involving the other parties

343
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:23,000
and on the data plane is just checked

344
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,650
according to the usual filters whether

345
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,540
it's a valid announcement or not but

346
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,280
then it is accepted and it's just

347
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,670
implemented in the data plane so we

348
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:35,959
instantiate filters on our platform and

349
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:39,110
as a result actually the traffic is in

350
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,780
every case black hole we cannot only

351
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:45,170
placode traffic we can also rate limit

352
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:49,339
traffic and say just NTP traffic 100 max

353
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:53,170
or whatever so that we have really this

354
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:56,050
sufficient every territory in this case

355
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:58,370
how our system looks I just give a

356
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:00,609
overview of the different layers so

357
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:03,530
first we have the signaling layer and

358
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,440
our thinking is yeah let's just use PGP

359
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,750
we don't need to really change how the

360
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:12,230
system is the interacts with customers

361
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,859
as of today and therefore just encode a

362
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:18,319
mapping to a set of filters which can be

363
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:22,040
defined by customers or predefined

364
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:24,409
filters or whatever is the easiest we

365
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:27,139
could also think about an API obviously

366
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:29,180
which comes with advantages in the

367
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,340
authorization whether you're authorized

368
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:33,590
to to discard the traffic or towards

369
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:37,760
your problem prefix IP or towards

370
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,709
towards you and yeah it goes into IXP

371
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,020
interface which validates all this stuff

372
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,800
and then we have a black holing manager

373
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,540
which actually needs to always have the

374
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,330
set of rules actually should be

375
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,190
represented in the platform and also

376
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,449
abstracting from the implementation

377
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,060
because as I mentioned before

378
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,710
some of the ACL stuff on the routers is

379
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:01,889
different from when data been done if we

380
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:04,470
have an abstraction layer we can do it

381
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:07,310
and different systems basically at the

382
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:09,690
same time through the same interface and

383
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:11,460
yeah then we have actually filtering

384
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:15,960
layer which happens on the data plane

385
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:19,890
within the boxes and here we just assume

386
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,390
at the management and signaling part so

387
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:24,570
actually what we're doing is we have a

388
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:26,430
ibgp session with our black hole in

389
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,490
controller like from the road server and

390
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:32,640
then we passed the BGP messages simple

391
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:34,380
so far and then we process those and

392
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,960
check them with the routing information

393
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,300
base just to verify whether someone is

394
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,420
not allowed or it's allowed to announce

395
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,159
those and then we just check the

396
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,410
configuration changes or take the

397
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,990
configuration changes and only the the

398
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,110
Delta are the changes and processed them

399
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:56,520
we need a em a maximum burst size token

400
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:58,110
bucket Q so that we can ya shape sort of

401
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,200
like if someone is announcing a lot of

402
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:04,919
filters a lot of rules we should

403
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,800
implement to smoothen it a bit and you

404
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:09,540
are not going into the trouble of

405
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,190
overloading the system and then we have

406
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:13,470
the network manager which actually is

407
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,810
the abstraction of the implementation

408
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,910
and our suggestion is you're a course

409
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,830
network manager Sdn network management

410
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:23,520
manager it really depends on the a

411
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:26,460
hardware of the XP which other is

412
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,590
deployed and actually the implementation

413
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,970
can be done in different ways so

414
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:35,040
actually now we have all the building

415
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:37,950
blocks so we have the kernel arity we

416
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:41,220
allow filtering on UDP TCP the different

417
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:44,340
ports there we have a very low signaling

418
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,960
complexity meaning that we don't need

419
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,939
the cooperation of the others and we

420
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,210
just have a bgp community or maybe an

421
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,580
api to really interact with the IXP so

422
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:56,790
only interact with the XP rest is done

423
00:19:53,580 --> 00:20:00,000
and data plane and yeah it's enforced by

424
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:01,800
the XP thereby we have the telemetry we

425
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,900
have a monitoring system with the

426
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,850
statistics you would need and to

427
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,830
understand what's actually going on we

428
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:10,019
have the scale scale abilities

429
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:13,830
with dropping the stuff in Lion rate in

430
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:16,140
the actual fabric and we implemented in

431
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:19,080
the existing hardware at the XPS on no

432
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:22,320
new equipment needed and our

433
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:25,470
implementation challenge are mostly that

434
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,779
the BGP processing part is not trivial

435
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:31,529
if we look at the updates withdrawn what

436
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,990
happens if there is a wolf drone and to

437
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:35,789
keep the states if you want to have like

438
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:37,860
multiple or your having multiple route

439
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:40,379
service but you just want to have one

440
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,969
stage and all this stuff and the

441
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,059
configuration proxy which is have a

442
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:50,039
vendor specific but this happened to be

443
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:52,379
another machinery or system in in our

444
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,330
system and this increases complexity

445
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,570
significantly so the issue is we're not

446
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,629
configuring the boxes because we do it

447
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,010
on sub second time frames so it has to

448
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:04,440
be done through a proxy and through a

449
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:09,049
system and actually what we have in

450
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,940
place was not really 100% designed for

451
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:14,760
configuration changes in in sub second

452
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,580
granularity and yeah the question is a

453
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,389
bit why not really using why not simply

454
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,418
using flowspec

455
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:23,610
yeah the issue here is first of all not

456
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:26,429
all vendors fully supported yet and

457
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,260
actually the real reason for asset I

458
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:31,139
experienced that our route server

459
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,419
software does not support it but we

460
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:36,209
implemented in a ways and if the route

461
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,519
server would be able to export the flow

462
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,260
spec rules in a generic format we could

463
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,120
also take it in the rest of our system

464
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,490
since we built those different layer we

465
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,658
can just exchange this part and the rest

466
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:51,210
of the system may remain the same so now

467
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:54,299
the only question does it scale so

468
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:56,220
actually we have two relevant dimensions

469
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:59,549
for scaling so scaling with the numbers

470
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:02,580
of filters and I expects peapods where

471
00:21:59,549 --> 00:22:04,950
those filters should be applied and we

472
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,710
have configuration update frequency

473
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:10,919
right so new black holding request or

474
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:14,460
filter request actually and the first

475
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:17,279
one yeah we need just a sufficient TEM

476
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:20,760
space to really match the header fields

477
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,539
and really do it with a lot of rules for

478
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,019
a lot of ports

479
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:27,269
and we did a measurement in the lab with

480
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:29,840
our gear to really figure this out I

481
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:32,609
have the results on the next slide and

482
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,439
the other thing is really do sort of a

483
00:22:32,609 --> 00:22:36,779
black box test like throwing the

484
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:39,389
filtering rules in on one side and

485
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,879
weighting how long does it take to

486
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:45,928
really apply in the data plane so when

487
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:48,330
is the traffic discarded and we have the

488
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:50,820
the prototype or the system design

489
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,639
stands we have allow for the three

490
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:57,590
future updates per second on average and

491
00:22:53,639 --> 00:23:02,459
70% of the updates black holing updates

492
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:05,488
are below one second so going back to

493
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,009
the scalability of the system so what I

494
00:23:05,489 --> 00:23:11,609
have here is I have the mac filter

495
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:14,940
criteria means filters applied on a mac

496
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:17,189
mac address like mac filters and on the

497
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,830
other dimension i have the level 3 and

498
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:21,960
level 4 filters filter criteria to

499
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:24,989
really then drop the traffic and this is

500
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,289
the assumption that under the given n

501
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:31,470
and n is defined as a set of

502
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:34,710
configurations we observe at the eye XP

503
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:37,529
as of today I can do 2 nd a stuff not go

504
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:40,889
in into more details here but if we

505
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:43,559
assume that 20% of the customers at the

506
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:47,580
exchange is using it it scares pretty

507
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:50,099
well right like 10 times n on the y-axis

508
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:55,139
and four times n on the x-axis however

509
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:57,899
if we increase slightly the number of XP

510
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:59,758
members using this system we don't

511
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:02,879
really scale that well anymore we just

512
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,029
have from what we observe today eight

513
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:09,539
times more and the other criteria and

514
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:12,720
three times more and if every member at

515
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:17,190
the XP would actually use the system the

516
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,729
scalability yeah still lower but given

517
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:23,009
that it's not a realistic scenario as

518
00:24:19,729 --> 00:24:27,330
about 20% today using remote record

519
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:30,480
blackening at the XP so we just did our

520
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:32,908
measurement experiment again so we

521
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,150
ordered another DDoS attack on to our

522
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:37,900
new system we

523
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:39,880
the slash 32 and this time not only to

524
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:45,370
black all the traffic but first we did

525
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:47,950
the shaping on 200 megabits and yeah

526
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,020
this is basically the result so it it

527
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,090
instantly works

528
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:55,720
first we shape the traffic then we drop

529
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:58,090
the traffic and no cooperation of other

530
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,680
peers is allowed so for the shaping part

531
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:03,040
the number of peers that sending traffic

532
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,950
remains stable and for the dropping part

533
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:09,639
dropping traffic really goes goes to

534
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:11,290
zero so it's and we just filter on NTP

535
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,450
traffic right so if you would have a

536
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:15,460
real service this would still be

537
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:19,180
reachable and there would be no effect

538
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:22,420
from the DDoS attack on it so in summary

539
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:25,080
a number of DDoS mitigation solutions

540
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:27,850
exist today but most of them have

541
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:32,260
scalability issues or are fairly

542
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:33,969
expensive so we identified and measure a

543
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,610
black hole in limitations so really

544
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,530
God's good understanding of what does

545
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:42,129
not work what works and why does it not

546
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,780
work and we proposed a new black homing

547
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,760
system just call it an advanced black

548
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:47,860
holing and try to combine the benefits

549
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,790
of what's existing there and merge it

550
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:56,409
into one system at the XP and yeah our

551
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:59,440
prototype works very well and has a BGP

552
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:01,720
interface we just need to bgp community

553
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,550
or you could work with the api interface

554
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:08,920
and we have evaluated our system and

555
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:12,100
actually figured that it yeah proof to

556
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,710
god scalability here so that's this

557
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,139
content it content wise now from my side

558
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,360
I just have one final remark teacakes

559
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,570
new york peering Landry numbering so if

560
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,750
you didn't change do that please cutoff

561
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:28,889
date 28th of February after that we are

562
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:31,780
blocking BGP port with our new system

563
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:34,000
okay so that's it from my side so all

564
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:37,810
the details if you're curious what we

565
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,740
did and some more experiments we did can

566
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:48,019
be found in this paper thank you

567
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:48,019
[Applause]

568
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,050
hello

569
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,730
i-i'll be freedmen with kenta I have a

570
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:57,379
couple questions just to understand

571
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:59,910
what's going on so is the policy being

572
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:01,140
abstracted and then sent to people to

573
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,450
apply on their end or is this being

574
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,250
applied at the exchange equipment it's

575
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,280
applied at the exchange equipment okay

576
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,870
and then the second question what's the

577
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,480
authentication to make sure that people

578
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:13,860
don't try to push policy for things that

579
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,010
are not under attack or affect other

580
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:18,600
people yeah so it's like whether with a

581
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:23,460
normal black holing as well so for an

582
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:26,010
API you you log in in a customer portal

583
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:28,020
or authentication towards an API and

584
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,800
with the BGP it's just like irr

585
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,290
databases

586
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,320
and they're just there as we apply those

587
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,730
today at the route server as well okay

588
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,830
so it's going through filters for the

589
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,830
person yeah but I could still say that

590
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,570
someone else is attacking me but then it

591
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:45,179
would only apply to me reply to all the

592
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,639
appears that are so if someone in taking

593
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:50,490
you the so actually it just works by

594
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,670
design for your IP prefixes so you may

595
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,830
not announce a prefix you can announce

596
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:59,460
your prefix if you are on the attack and

597
00:27:55,830 --> 00:28:01,500
it's proper it's just propagated toward

598
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,830
the XP and the traffic coming from all

599
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,580
over

600
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:07,919
SaaS s is dropped ingress at the XP

601
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,379
fabric okay so someone is attacking me I

602
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:16,950
can't cause that to be source okay God

603
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:20,790
exactly thank you a quick question Brian

604
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:25,380
Dixon with GoDaddy sorry you're doing

605
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:28,040
all the validation based on IRS what I'm

606
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,940
wondering about is would it be feasible

607
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:34,110
possible do you have all the information

608
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:38,330
you need to do BC P 38 source filtering

609
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:38,330
for all of the members

610
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:43,640
please yeah yeah I see where you're

611
00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:45,860
going

612
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:50,990
yeah because I think most of the black

613
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:53,840
hole necessity comes out of a good

614
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:56,570
amount so preventing the traffic from

615
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,789
being multiplied in the first place is

616
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,129
gonna be much more of a win I think yeah

617
00:28:58,789 --> 00:29:02,990
two things so I agree with you so we

618
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:07,549
just the root cause of DDoS is poofing

619
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:12,620
and the secondary mark is actually we

620
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:14,809
still don't want to yeah so we want to

621
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:17,539
stay as much neutral as we can so

622
00:29:14,809 --> 00:29:20,899
basically if you are saying drop my

623
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:23,149
traffic to my IP that's fine but we

624
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:26,389
don't want to interfere with what's

625
00:29:23,149 --> 00:29:30,350
going on in the Internet and just force

626
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:32,330
people to to not spoof so to not spoof

627
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:35,178
you're correct but the question was why

628
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:40,520
is spoof traffic within the ASO so if

629
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:42,770
you would apply filters anti-spoofing

630
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:45,110
filter and you would apply it like you

631
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:47,450
would decide you want to do it that's a

632
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:50,270
different story event right but that's

633
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,799
the problem is nobody's doing it this

634
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:54,620
would provide at least a mechanism for

635
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:56,539
everybody to sign up do it scale ibly

636
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,789
all you have to do is make it a checkbox

637
00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:02,570
and then make that checkbox mandatory if

638
00:29:58,789 --> 00:30:04,669
you want to join the i-x yeah I don't

639
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:08,770
know it feels a bit like I be the

640
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:08,770
internet police then but it's a very Mac

641
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:19,580
Tilikum I I'm not going to deeply

642
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:22,760
discuss the authorization thing but I

643
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:26,029
think your statement that well okay just

644
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,450
use the usual authentication for BGP is

645
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:38,919
a well-defined technique that can be

646
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:43,389
relied on aside from the question of

647
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:52,029
a dependable authorization scheme that I

648
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:56,820
really would like to see I think you may

649
00:30:52,029 --> 00:31:02,499
be missing one interesting function that

650
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:07,059
should come with this you are changing

651
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:11,739
your simple layer 2 switching fabric to

652
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:15,269
something that is doing some magic some

653
00:31:11,739 --> 00:31:18,580
traffic and actually hard to

654
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:21,330
characterize if you if you don't have

655
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:25,629
insight of what the logic is is

656
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:30,580
disappearing wouldn't you need to

657
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:35,949
actually expose to the members of of the

658
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:41,019
IG's exchange the current status of what

659
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:43,359
traffic you are blocking yeah so

660
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:48,960
actually the IDS that we provide those

661
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:52,019
insights so we need to yeah well ok

662
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,340
probably probably should go into the

663
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:57,749
presentation as well

664
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:02,320
and then actually also an interesting

665
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:07,929
second-level question comes up what of

666
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:11,080
that what is the implied dangers of

667
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:15,309
actually making that in that information

668
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:18,100
available probably needs to be looked at

669
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:21,369
I'm not sure however it really is a

670
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:24,549
danger but just publishing critical

671
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:28,209
security information should not be done

672
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:29,679
without but you can log in Deutsche

673
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:35,889
Telekom and then you will just see the

674
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:37,989
relevant statistics hi Roland Dobbins or

675
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:40,359
Burnett Scout or net Scouter or I'm not

676
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,830
sure was to say these days on so I I

677
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:43,090
just want to make sure that I can't

678
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,699
descent big you wait a little bit of the

679
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:46,720
terminology is being used here if I

680
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,179
understand the way the system works

681
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,510
correctly is you have a predefined

682
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:54,360
schema BGP community and attribute

683
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:57,840
you share with your ixp participants and

684
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,310
so they'll advertise a destination IP

685
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,699
address and they'll use community

686
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,360
attributes to describe the layer four

687
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,340
characteristics that they want to drive

688
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,520
and they send that advertisement to your

689
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,379
router bgp then your route server talks

690
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,190
to some kind of orchestration system

691
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:18,660
that then goes and uses what croisé it

692
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:20,880
uses apples yes to both I guess yeah so

693
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:23,040
actually as I said it's a prototype so

694
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,050
the the initial idea is to just have

695
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,389
this this mapping you just were

696
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,669
explaining but in the future you can

697
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:31,680
also say okay maybe we just want to have

698
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:34,200
it purely dynamic so you log in in a

699
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:36,780
customer portal you define your rules

700
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,580
there and then you reference those so

701
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,040
it's not a publicly available list but a

702
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,929
custom list for sure sure yeah yeah

703
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,820
you're seeing what technology is

704
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:48,240
dropping the package is it croisé or is

705
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:52,679
it ackles or both what what technology

706
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:58,470
is dropping the traffic ah okay yeah so

707
00:33:52,680 --> 00:34:01,890
it's in this VIN so in this vendor type

708
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:03,150
its cost but actually it does not really

709
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,580
matter because we looked at different

710
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:10,100
vendors and four different vendors

711
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:12,509
different technologies work work

712
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,759
differentiated way okay so I guess my

713
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,620
question is I was very very confused by

714
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,379
the title of this presentation because

715
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,759
when we're talking about DDoS mitigation

716
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:22,918
black holing has a very specific meaning

717
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,720
yeah right destination based black

718
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:26,879
holing source based remote trigger black

719
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,029
holing what you've really built here is

720
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,129
a DDoS you know attack mitigation system

721
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,040
where you've abstracted away the

722
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:37,230
underlying packet boarding or dropping

723
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,820
technology right you have a system that

724
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:41,250
is essentially technology independent

725
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,600
right and so I would just suggest that

726
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,980
for the sake of clarity that you don't

727
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,629
call it black hole you call it something

728
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,460
else it's very cool and thanks for

729
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:50,279
describing yeah good

730
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:54,360
fair point yes so it was so my challenge

731
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,830
was yeah sorry my challenge was if I

732
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,540
speak about something different nobody

733
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,340
really knows what this talk is about if

734
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:00,720
I refer to black holing everyone know

735
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,090
it's a bit in which direction I'm going

736
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,990
but it's a fair point yeah that they

737
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:08,330
know what it

738
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:08,330
actually isn't yeah fair enough yeah

739
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:14,490
okay

740
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,950
ace Kumari Google one of your slides had

741
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:19,890
a pretty graphing showing the traffic

742
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:23,310
but broken down by port from a customer

743
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,270
do you generally collect that no okay I

744
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:30,290
didn't think so I just wanted to make

745
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:30,290
completely thank you

746
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,580
you
