1
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:20,400
all right let's see if this works

2
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,630
all right good afternoon appreciate the

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:29,049
opportunity of having me here again at

4
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:31,599
the nanog the topic this time is optics

5
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:35,880
still as usual but it's gonna be around

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:38,350
400 G giving you a bit of a market view

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,370
finisher for those of you that not

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,559
familiar with it

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,720
we're the largest manufacturer and

10
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,580
supplier of optical transceivers into

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:49,290
the industry mainly OEMs but also in

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:53,620
customers networks users data centers so

13
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:55,659
let's talk about again 400 G and how the

14
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:57,489
deployment models and the deployment

15
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:59,800
trends are happening in the industry and

16
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:03,070
I'm gonna take a look not only at the

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:05,740
hyper scale segment of the market which

18
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:08,050
is of course where the leading edge is

19
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,309
and what's driving deployments early on

20
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:11,408
I'm gonna touch a bit of that but also

21
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:13,300
some of the implications for deployments

22
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:16,920
after that like you know smaller clouds

23
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,060
and also an enterprise eventually so

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,979
within the restaurant of racks just to

25
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,810
set the stage right we know that 10g has

26
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,880
been deployed for a long time 25 G

27
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:27,610
Ethernet is being deployed now it's

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,220
mainly in the hyper scale world and the

29
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,990
assumption is that then hundred G or 50

30
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,179
G will follow probably a combination of

31
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,500
both depending on who you talk to but

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:39,000
you know we need to start getting ready

33
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:41,640
400 G to the server if we look at

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,380
connections between datacenter racks

35
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,150
forages will be deployed hundred G's the

36
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,759
majority of being deployed today in

37
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:52,720
those large hyper scale networks in data

38
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:54,850
centers with 400 G being next in that

39
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,170
space but as we will see there's still a

40
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,020
lot of hungry G that will be deployed

41
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:01,450
for a very long time and then of course

42
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,940
between data centers longer spans DC is

43
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,440
that you know what's traditionally the

44
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:10,780
space for 10 G DWDM tenable modules

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,430
that's now giving way to coherent optics

46
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,790
we're gonna touch a bit on that as well

47
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:17,890
coherent 100 G 200 G and then you know

48
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,359
what are we doing to get ready for 400 G

49
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:25,119
and Beyond between data centers so if

50
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,640
you look at market data right this is a

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,319
market data slide from the Lauro and

52
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,569
these are actually port shipments

53
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,970
Ethernet port shipments in in millions

54
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:35,600
and as you can see there is it still a

55
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,660
lot of volume 400

56
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,269
and 200g that 200g number they are

57
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,150
includes high density hundred G is 2 by

58
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,830
100 it also includes native 200 G

59
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,930
Ethernet although that's still a

60
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:50,030
question mark of you know how much of a

61
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,190
market that will be but some of us

62
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,200
believe that in the enterprise space 200

63
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:58,220
G will be a very interesting cost point

64
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,170
overall and as you can see 400 G shown

65
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:04,040
there at the top in gray so if we zoom

66
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,989
in after 2020 into that 400 G segment we

67
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,540
see that obviously early on it is really

68
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,300
the large cloud service providers the

69
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:13,579
top 4 in in North America the rest of

70
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,950
cloud following in the green bars with

71
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,350
enterprise starting to appear there in

72
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,660
2021 and beyond so it's a lot of debate

73
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:23,480
of how quickly this Ram will happen this

74
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,640
is the laurels view it may happen in

75
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,590
this manner or a bit slower but it's

76
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:30,859
certainly starting to happen I would say

77
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:34,610
next year in some of those major major

78
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,650
hyper scale data centers so what we're

79
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,930
discussing here is the transition from a

80
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:43,940
model of a 32 ports which Ethernet

81
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:47,570
switch using QSP 28100 g2 in the hyper

82
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:49,220
scale case 32 ports now 400 G with all

83
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,410
the implications in physical form

84
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,580
factors and thermal dissipation and an

85
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,160
optics of course that we're going to

86
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:58,040
discuss moving from a 3.2 terabytes

87
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:02,060
which a terabyte switch to a 12 point 8

88
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,709
2 rabbits which 200 G model 6.4 terabyte

89
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,380
is shown there in the middle as I said

90
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:08,870
there are some that are considering

91
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,880
deploying that or planning it could also

92
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,700
be an interesting cost point in certain

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,620
markets maybe now in 32 ports but

94
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,880
certainly with some kind of over

95
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,430
subscription for the enterprise space

96
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,048
again operating at 200 G so don't

97
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:23,570
discount that yet it really depends how

98
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:28,700
quickly 400 G in general comes down in

99
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:31,040
price if we look at the standardization

100
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:32,659
work to support all these interfaces and

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,910
we look we're gonna look at you know how

102
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,040
those interfaces will be deployed in

103
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,770
some of these models we see that the I

104
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,800
Triple E and as well as the market in

105
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,039
general MSAs have been quite active on

106
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,820
this regard the H I believe almost a

107
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,100
year ago already already finalized the

108
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,950
in 802 the three BS which is the first

109
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,810
400 gigabit ethernet standard which is

110
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,780
from there at the top in the top table

111
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:01,180
it includes primarily single mode

112
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,039
applications as you can see there's a

113
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,890
parallel welcome dr4 and we're gonna

114
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,440
discuss that in more detail as well as a

115
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:11,169
rate and fr8 which is really like the

116
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:14,969
lr4 equivalence or CWDM for equivalents

117
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:17,680
in 100g but now at 400 G primarily for

118
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:21,640
duplex single mode connectivity in

119
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,660
places like carriers or inter exchanges

120
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:28,240
obviously what follows in the second

121
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,370
table is really next-generation 100g to

122
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,250
support connectivity to these 400 G

123
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,710
ports so this 100 G interfaces in the

124
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,960
second table now instead of having for

125
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,320
wavelength running at 25 G they focus on

126
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:45,099
one wavelength running at 1310 at 100 G

127
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:47,469
pam-4 or two wavelength or two streams

128
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,710
rather at running at 50 G pam-4 in the

129
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,270
case of SR 2 and then lastly in the

130
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:54,310
third one at the a Triple E there is now

131
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,310
work being done on the multimode space

132
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:59,230
multimode is expected to have a longer

133
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,880
term interesting price points for

134
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,970
enterprise but in the interim there is

135
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,680
these parallel in combination with by

136
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,340
dye technologies are being standardized

137
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,290
for certain applications in cloud hyper

138
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,090
scale clouds in in China they're the

139
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:15,550
ones driving those developments again

140
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,799
due to cost primarily where multimode

141
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:20,500
can be can be deployed at a more

142
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:23,260
attractive cost point the table at the

143
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,600
bottom is a it's an MSA 100 G lambda is

144
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:30,039
the first MSA there has been working on

145
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:34,390
for a while now in some of the gaps that

146
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:38,260
are not standardized by a Triple E so a

147
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:40,030
2 kilometer 4 by 100 G as well as some

148
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:43,510
of the longer reach single wavelength

149
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:46,150
100 G interfaces for certain again hyper

150
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:48,550
scale applications again not to discuss

151
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,049
this in detail I'm gonna discuss show

152
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:52,810
you a little bit where they fit on the

153
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,300
network in our view in the next couple

154
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,950
of slides in general technology wise is

155
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:59,140
still expected that anything under 100

156
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:01,450
meters will still be Vixen based

157
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,900
multimode based on pixel technology and

158
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:05,719
I'm gonna explain why

159
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,880
and then silicon photonics in the 1 to 2

160
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:10,850
kilometer space maybe 500 meters to 2

161
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,490
kilometer space certainly optimized for

162
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:17,240
500 meters to 1 kilometer and then

163
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:20,539
traditional dmal EML which means d FBS

164
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,550
and so on used today at 100 g will

165
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:25,849
continue to be used up to 40 kilometers

166
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:29,710
at least coherent comes after that and

167
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:32,539
will again discuss it again at the end

168
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,070
so the new thing about this and you know

169
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,080
many of you know this already the

170
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:38,120
industry is going away from nrz going

171
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,370
away from ones and zeros in the optical

172
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,039
signaling and going to pam-4 which means

173
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,800
for level signaling this means that for

174
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,960
us we need to design not only new optics

175
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,910
and new manufacturing infrastructure and

176
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:52,030
testing that can support this multi

177
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,070
level of 4 level encoding in the signal

178
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,619
but also for users such as your cells

179
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:59,479
you need to know how to install it how

180
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,919
to test it how to make sure that you

181
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,960
know you get the signal-to-noise ratio

182
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,210
and so on and obviously the reason to go

183
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,729
to Pam for is to get bandwidth

184
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:11,060
efficiency you get you know 2 bits per

185
00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:12,680
symbol and of course the trade-off is

186
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,699
noise right so it's harder to build

187
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,680
harder to you know shorter blink budgets

188
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:22,610
and so that's something that as an

189
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,470
industry we need to do to be aware of we

190
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,669
also believe that SW diem is something

191
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm not gonna be discussed here today

192
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:29,479
but this is multiple wavelengths for

193
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,150
multimode applications will play a role

194
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:33,770
in 400g as well it is not however part

195
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,468
of the standard today because it's

196
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:38,208
primarily an enterprise value

197
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:39,650
proposition and that's you know not

198
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:45,349
something that the the a triple is

199
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:46,579
focusing on today as we said so let's

200
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,490
look at the some of the form factors

201
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:52,850
that are starting to appear for 400g

202
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:54,380
transceivers one of them is CF p8 that

203
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,330
has been around or being defined

204
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,610
designed for a while is in production

205
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:01,339
you can expect to see these kinds of

206
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,980
modules in certain core routers such as

207
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,810
you know just like you saw CF p CF b2

208
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,450
early on at 100g

209
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:10,339
eight years ago nine years ago you're

210
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,459
going to see CF p 8 in some of those

211
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,079
routers basically due to time to market

212
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,279
reasons these modules have been you know

213
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:18,949
hundred development for the last

214
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:21,560
years and they're kind of like a CFP -

215
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:23,089
they're slightly shorter than a CFP -

216
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,569
but they looked pretty much like a CFP -

217
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,709
but it's 400 G instead of 100 G the one

218
00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:29,689
that's catching of course the industry

219
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:32,599
attention are the smaller form factors

220
00:09:29,689 --> 00:09:37,370
the equivalent to a QFP that will now

221
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,980
operate at 400 G so there are two msas

222
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:43,819
in the in the industry many of us are

223
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:46,160
members of both one is qss PDD and the

224
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:48,589
other one is OSP and they both have

225
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,420
proponents or detractors and myself and

226
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,240
my company tends to be neutral we build

227
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,459
whatever the market once and it is true

228
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,300
that there are numerous advantages for

229
00:09:55,459 --> 00:10:00,829
QSF PDD it is a module that is backwards

230
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,219
compatible the host is backwards

231
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:07,758
compatible to qsf P so if the switch has

232
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:12,889
a QFP DD host it can accept QSP 28 100 G

233
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:14,569
or even QSP 56 200 G in the same host so

234
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:18,920
that provides flexibility at the whole

235
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:20,839
other at the switch level it is however

236
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:22,969
smaller form factor harder to cool

237
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,559
signal integrity concern so that's all

238
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,410
this whole work that's being done by the

239
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,029
industry and we know it we believe it

240
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,529
will be solved but it just takes you

241
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,750
know it adds a little bit more risk to

242
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:34,250
developments and deployments both the

243
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,220
optics and also the switches with the

244
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:41,779
QSF PDD oh it's a piece of bigger module

245
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:43,850
and it's actually the advantages there

246
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:46,519
is thermal management presumably it's

247
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:49,100
easier the quality of the connector

248
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:51,319
signal integrity wise is better it's a

249
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,139
new connector

250
00:10:51,319 --> 00:10:57,969
it also supports 32 ports brienne it's

251
00:10:54,139 --> 00:10:59,779
not backwards compatible with QSP 28

252
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:01,250
there are some people working on

253
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:02,899
adaptors and so on but that that's

254
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,189
actually operationally a little bit more

255
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,529
complex although it's certainly doable

256
00:11:04,189 --> 00:11:09,709
we believe both transceivers in the

257
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:10,970
market will be available we as well as

258
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:15,319
many others are certainly planning for

259
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:17,870
both and you know there'll be a previous

260
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:20,389
transition we believe we're both will be

261
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:21,709
offered by the various system OEMs so

262
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,870
it's gonna be some complexity and the

263
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:25,638
complexity will be that depending on who

264
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,889
the end customer is some of the optical

265
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:29,770
interfaces may be available on one and

266
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:31,240
not of the other right so early on

267
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,920
it might be that if you want certain

268
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,880
interfaces you may have to go to one or

269
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,069
the other front factor and that's

270
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,260
certainly complex as a user and also as

271
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:41,830
a system OEM but that will you know get

272
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,990
solve eventually due to market forces if

273
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:45,520
I have to read myself I think you SFPD D

274
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,760
will win but that's just my own personal

275
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:50,410
opinion if any of you by the way wants

276
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,880
to see mechanicals I have them actually

277
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,370
with me they're very small so if you are

278
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:56,980
curious I want to see qsp 28 or DD

279
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:59,530
rather or OSF peak I'm seeing after and

280
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,150
I can show them to you some mechanical

281
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:06,120
samples if you don't try to map all

282
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,410
these interfaces in in the media types

283
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,420
you know multimode on the first row

284
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,030
single mode and then parallel optics

285
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:15,910
with MPO connectors and then duplex with

286
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:17,199
LC we can do this something similar to

287
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:20,079
this at hundred year than this in the

288
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,170
past now this is for 400 G regardless of

289
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,150
form factor and as you can see parallel

290
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,699
multimode SRA 10s are four point two

291
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:30,340
again driven mainly but some of the

292
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:33,040
Chinese hyper scale applications there's

293
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:35,050
certainly a dr four which is mainly the

294
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,660
first one that we think will be deployed

295
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:40,359
and this is equivalent to PSM for but

296
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,790
you know runs at 4 1 by 100 g can also

297
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,530
be found out to 4 by 100 so that's one

298
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:48,250
of the use cases for this these Tier

299
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:50,260
four modules and then a large larger

300
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,600
number of duplex single motors as

301
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,230
usually happens happens are hungry G so

302
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,250
we have F r8l irate which I Triple E

303
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:04,270
compliant there are a few MSA codes fr

304
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:07,090
for another four and then some longer

305
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,560
reach codes ER 8 and Zr which I will

306
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:10,630
discuss at the end and that's actually

307
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,729
now being worked on by I Triple E so if

308
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:17,470
you look at a similar table by 400 G the

309
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,120
I Triple E standards were actually fewer

310
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,070
were actually two or three only the

311
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,260
majority were MSAs was a big confusion

312
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:24,790
in the market for a while they're at 400

313
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,530
G we're seeing more standardization

314
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,530
activity which is actually good I think

315
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:36,129
so the top

316
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:38,049
right quadrant is what I mentioned

317
00:13:36,129 --> 00:13:39,220
earlier that's duplex multimode not

318
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:41,319
important for hyperscale

319
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,749
or for internet exchange or or carriers

320
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:45,519
but it will be important for enterprise

321
00:13:43,749 --> 00:13:47,919
eventually people want to maintain their

322
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,399
in existing infrastructure 100 you know

323
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:53,559
40 100 400 that's again

324
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,660
TBD as an interface kind of like an SW

325
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,368
dm8 right but where were many years away

326
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:02,108
from that there's no market pool at the

327
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:03,579
moment so how are these things being

328
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:05,769
deployed it's hard to generalize of

329
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:07,079
course on the application reuse cases

330
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:09,999
but this is kind of like a general

331
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:13,540
mapping of you know how that transition

332
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:16,989
from the 25 100 G model today with 3.2

333
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:19,868
terabit switches to begin 12.8 with

334
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:23,679
switches they're shown in red so server

335
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:26,410
to tour transitioning from 25 gig to 50

336
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,410
and 100 most likely using optics only

337
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:32,858
copper ducts which are primarily used at

338
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:34,839
10g still have a place at 25 G but only

339
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:37,899
about 3 meters right if we go now to

340
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:39,789
server connections that 50 or 100 that

341
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:42,129
will be a much shorter link probably not

342
00:14:39,789 --> 00:14:43,929
usable so we're thinking that both

343
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:45,850
active optical cables and multimode

344
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:48,220
optics will play a predominant role in

345
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,910
the rack when you know when this

346
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:55,779
interface were being deployed the role

347
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:58,089
map now for tour to tier 1 or 2 leaf

348
00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,789
most likely would be a combination of

349
00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,949
dr4 the hyper scale of that single mode

350
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:05,529
interface and again as I said China is

351
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:08,108
driving us at 4.2 and sr8 as well as

352
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,019
active optical cables and then primarily

353
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:13,689
single mode again between leaf and spine

354
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:16,809
again similarly 200 G most likely fr8

355
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:21,509
which is 2 kilometers fr4 dr4 as well

356
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:21,509
for some you know high radix

357
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:28,119
interconnections between leaf and spine

358
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:31,449
if we then look at DC I as I said

359
00:15:28,119 --> 00:15:33,759
earlier 400 G is rotten off next could

360
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:35,559
be already irate over dark fiber for

361
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,029
example certainly the I Triple E

362
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:41,319
standing on 40 kilometers gr8 which is

363
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,239
something that expected to be available

364
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:46,539
relatively soon actually as a standard

365
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:47,440
list and then Zr coherent 480 kilometers

366
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:48,850
and beyond

367
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,410
right which is again also a very

368
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,300
interesting application space and

369
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:54,520
there's work going on in the standards

370
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,520
that I will talk about as I mentioned

371
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,410
so let's if we'd not dig little deeper

372
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,939
on the technologies involved in some of

373
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,439
these interfaces right what are some of

374
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,670
the general trends some of which I

375
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,940
mentioned that are driving those

376
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,680
technology choices so one is obviously

377
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,930
we said continuous increase in man with

378
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:14,050
density you notice that we double the

379
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:16,300
speed we double the bandwidth in the

380
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,819
switches but the actual fun factor or

381
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:21,579
the density port density doesn't change

382
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,760
so the question is starting to pop up

383
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:26,950
now at 400 G and beyond is the pluggable

384
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,420
model good enough right which point

385
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,390
pluggable optics would not be feasible

386
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,550
and we will all have to go to onboard

387
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:37,210
optics and get away from the model that

388
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:39,490
we've been used to since 1998 right 1988

389
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,730
when the G week was introduced into the

390
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:46,990
market by by finish our IBM at the time

391
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,850
and another's HP so at one point the

392
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:51,790
other point is the increasing adoption

393
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:53,440
of optics as I mentioned so large larger

394
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:56,199
volume of optics given that copper now

395
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,370
can reach very short distance beyond 25

396
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:03,250
gig low latency optics remember that all

397
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:06,699
of these optics such as 100 G also for

398
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:09,089
pam-4 they require FEC so there are some

399
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:11,860
applications around cognitive computing

400
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:15,010
networks that won't require low latency

401
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,990
so potential optics using nrz

402
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,240
connectivity at 50 G for example and

403
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,220
also possible and are being explored for

404
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,780
supercomputing applications today but

405
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,530
they will they may become more prevalent

406
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:27,819
in non supercomputing applications the

407
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,260
maturity of key technologies we

408
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,149
mentioned silicon photonics also

409
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,760
improving vixx's to support this higher

410
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,640
speed at 50 GPM for and 100 GPM for

411
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,610
using a vixen for short reach and then

412
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,590
we mentioned coherent many times ready

413
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,929
driving down the cost and the power and

414
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,610
the size of coherent components to

415
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:50,850
support small form factors using

416
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:53,530
coherent technology so the first one is

417
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:55,090
it's a fun factor and this is now not a

418
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,379
surprise to many of you that deal with

419
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,600
physical layer stuff right so if you

420
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,700
look at the module types and the width

421
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,300
right at ng for eg

422
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:06,400
100 G even 400 G you can see that the

423
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:08,470
width right of the module that in the

424
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,450
rightmost column stays constant right so

425
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:12,580
we are having to innovate to maintain

426
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,220
that pore density the same right

427
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,990
basically as we increase in speed more

428
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,930
and more so the question is now what

429
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:22,750
will happen after 400 G most likely if

430
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,950
we don't go to on-board optics the

431
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:27,340
pluggable module we have to have a

432
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:30,370
similar pitch right or sighs so that's

433
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,899
that's certainly one challenge so this

434
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,459
kind of puts it into perspective the

435
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,710
huge improvement in that bandwidth

436
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:39,010
density that has gone on since the days

437
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,890
of 10g which is only again 15 years ago

438
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:43,030
if you think about it

439
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,890
again plug abilities are still a

440
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,060
requirement for optics non pluggable

441
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:47,800
optics have been around for quite a

442
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,440
while actually supercomputing have used

443
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,180
it

444
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,430
routers multi chassis applications

445
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,600
within routers have used onboard optics

446
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,700
which are non pluggable for quite a

447
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,280
while they have the benefit of having

448
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:02,290
the optics very close to the ASIC so you

449
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,820
drive the currents you drive and very

450
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:05,649
low so that brings down power

451
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:07,270
dissipation per module and as a whole

452
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,160
so you can achieve very high densities

453
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:13,510
from both thermal and physical

454
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,370
standpoint that higher bandwidth density

455
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:17,200
can be achieved now by increasing the

456
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,510
speed increasing the number of optics

457
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,490
obviously today state-of-the-art is one

458
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,400
of these cubes which are an inch by an

459
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,230
inch basically they have 16 channels 16

460
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,260
transmitters 16 receivers in an inch by

461
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:32,560
an inch they're running at 25 G per

462
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:34,060
channel today 50 G based on the

463
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:37,360
development again mainly driven by

464
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:39,129
supercomputers and again is that

465
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,590
something that could be a play for for

466
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,480
networking at 400 G I think we think the

467
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,040
market has decided so pluggable optics

468
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:47,980
are certainly feasible and will be the

469
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:52,300
predominant number way to deploy optics

470
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:53,770
again QFP DD o SSP there may be some

471
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,879
niche applications obviously that might

472
00:19:53,770 --> 00:20:01,480
require onboard optics is really beyond

473
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:03,330
400 g 800 1.6 terabit where i think the

474
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,070
industry is starting to look at

475
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:08,350
onboard optics ver and also co packaging

476
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,000
right in you know compiled using ICS

477
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,530
with optics much more seriously and

478
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,400
again that's not that's not a topic for

479
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:14,399
this for this talk

480
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,120
so the optical technologies themselves

481
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,639
we mentioned them already to go into

482
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,870
more detail right short reach vixens

483
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:26,770
continue to be the most cost effective

484
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:28,090
way to deliver bandwidth under 100

485
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:32,500
meters and that will continue to be the

486
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:34,899
case for for 400 G right for various

487
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,370
reasons total cost is the primary one if

488
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,580
you take into account the cost of the

489
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:41,110
optics themselves with plus the fiber so

490
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,030
things like higher bound was in the VIX

491
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:47,320
cells we mentioned 50 G and hundred GPM

492
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:50,620
for sparing capability Lauren silicon

493
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:53,620
photonics hopefully finally becoming

494
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,870
mature enough to be deployed so again

495
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,639
for intermediate reach and then long

496
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,149
reach that's more traditional DML an

497
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,650
email with again coherent optics coming

498
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:06,309
coming a little bit closer into the data

499
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:07,660
centers so why multimode optics again to

500
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:09,129
make it real we hear you hear a lot

501
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:11,440
about silicon photonics in the market

502
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,760
and so on and and you know we we believe

503
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,620
in silicon photonics for the right

504
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,600
application right so if you look at

505
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,399
anything under 100 meters however well

506
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,070
you can use it directly modulated pixel

507
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,140
there is no question that from the

508
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,110
thermal standpoint power dissipation

509
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,210
number of components types and

510
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,010
complexity of the optical alignments and

511
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:35,230
couplings as you can see on the left

512
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:37,420
hand side a pixel based design is is

513
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,809
more cost effective it's simpler easier

514
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,760
to build higher yield an equivalent

515
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:44,440
circuit using silicon photonics or

516
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,320
design silicon photonics is used is

517
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,750
shown on the right side but again much

518
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,790
more complex alignments single mode and

519
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:54,940
so on things that you obviously can deal

520
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:56,530
with if you have to mainly for reach but

521
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,960
not if you don't have to and again 100

522
00:21:56,530 --> 00:22:02,050
meters multi more optics using mixels

523
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:06,010
it's it's the it's the most effective

524
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:10,870
way if we go however to the 500 meters

525
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:11,770
to 2 kilometers as we mentioned we see

526
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:13,928
silicon photonics

527
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,879
beginning to shine and this is a new

528
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:18,040
application space missile application

529
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,920
spacer was developed 400 g networks

530
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:25,149
around PSN for 500 meters PS m4 is a

531
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,100
parallel optic single more parallel

532
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:31,870
optics interface' was deployed

533
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:33,549
early on in the days of of energy is now

534
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:36,008
not being deployed so much anymore a

535
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:37,809
gateway to CWDM for another duplex

536
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:40,360
single mode applications because they've

537
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,370
come down in price basically but it's an

538
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,600
effective way of just using no single

539
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:45,850
laser and then silicon photonics

540
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,219
modulators to transmit again to 500

541
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:52,418
meters or 1 kilometers so similarly to

542
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:54,580
what PS m4 was at 100g dr4 is being

543
00:22:52,419 --> 00:22:56,500
designed today so the leading edge

544
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,649
designs whether you see out there for

545
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:03,730
dr4 400g are based on silicon photonics

546
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:06,070
they use a single laser continuous

547
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,580
wavelength CW laser that is then split

548
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:11,740
and modulated independently into the 4

549
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,379
100g pam-4 channels so again the

550
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,820
technology has improved is improving for

551
00:23:14,379 --> 00:23:17,799
the right application there's still

552
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:19,750
yield issues but they will be actually

553
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:21,970
solved by the industry we believe it's

554
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:25,629
really the right solution for that

555
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,950
application space given the high level

556
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:28,330
of integration you can achieve you can

557
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,009
still not integrate the laser or you

558
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:33,580
gotta remember that silicon doesn't lay

559
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:35,590
so that that won't change so we can you

560
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,620
can see a variety of interfaces will be

561
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:41,320
deployed the only purpose of this slice

562
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:43,268
to show that 400g would not be just

563
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,418
point-to-point it will be spread out

564
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:48,820
four by 100 it will be prolly also

565
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:50,649
connecting to 200 G in some cases so you

566
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,259
can first see a mesh of different

567
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:55,000
interfaces and fan-out applications

568
00:23:53,259 --> 00:24:01,450
being deployed in different networks in

569
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:03,490
different deployment models the industry

570
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,250
is very active actually this is just a

571
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:07,870
some of the demos that the optical show

572
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,220
there were many many different vendors

573
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,199
and even MSA is providing

574
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,509
interoperability so the industry is

575
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,490
active providing transceivers bringing

576
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:17,049
bringing optics to market to support the

577
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:21,340
deployment of 400 G so that that's a

578
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:24,190
good thing for all of us if we look at

579
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:28,000
now DCI is right I mentioned that

580
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:30,669
already also 100 G when you go into 80

581
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,320
kilometers or 100 G or 100 kilometers

582
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:37,389
you have to use coherent technology

583
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:40,750
today we believe that also just like a

584
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:44,799
100 G applications up to 40

585
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,750
maybe 35 can be best met using direct

586
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,418
detect like er8 for example which is

587
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,740
being standardized but it's really you

588
00:24:49,419 --> 00:24:52,240
know if you want to go 80 kilometers or

589
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,450
100 kilometers you're gonna have to use

590
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,010
coherent applications we mentioned

591
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,100
standardization the OIF is standardizing

592
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,320
400gr interoperability agreement to

593
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,939
really make sure that now coherent is

594
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,490
interoperable and there's something that

595
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:09,400
does not exist at 100g but it will exist

596
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:12,970
at 400 G and then the Ethernet is now

597
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:17,740
also standardizing a coherent interface

598
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:20,500
in the newly created 802 the 3 CT task

599
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:24,250
force which is again focusing on an 80

600
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:30,730
kilometer implementation using coherent

601
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:32,530
optics for 400 G so basically the

602
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:34,030
industry presumably will move away for

603
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:36,158
the current model which is using

604
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,960
transponder boxes and you may recognize

605
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,610
some of these some of them might

606
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,549
actually be tonight in the Bering year

607
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:45,490
so a lot of very healthy ecosystem for

608
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:48,370
transponder 1ru boxes for DCI with 100 G

609
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:50,440
ports using things like CSP - ACO analog

610
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,178
coherent optics and so on that's being

611
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,760
deployed today that's mature technology

612
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,950
being deployed by many networks around

613
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,110
the world we're talking about here is

614
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:01,450
improving again coherent technology

615
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:03,039
improving the DSP lowering the size the

616
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,830
power of the optics the optical

617
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,429
packaging to fit in a scenic use of PDD

618
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:12,220
right we come for CS in in 3 years

619
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:15,789
right in 4 years there will be QSF PDD

620
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:18,669
modules very high density transceivers

621
00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:19,990
with coherent technology the DSP inside

622
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:22,570
this EO

623
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,309
that could you could be plugged in into

624
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,129
into any switch right that's the

625
00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:28,690
ultimate goal in a truly interoperable

626
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,010
environment again given the all the

627
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:33,940
interoperability agreements and

628
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:36,429
standards are being defined so my last

629
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,080
slide what happens after 400 G again not

630
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,450
a topic for this talk I think you're

631
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,270
gonna hear and they talk about it

632
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:46,059
tomorrow afternoon in his talk more in

633
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,549
detail but if we see a different

634
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:49,899
deployment model are moving into

635
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:50,980
doubling again the speed requiring a

636
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,809
hundred Gigabit Ethernet

637
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,800
the question is really is pluggable

638
00:26:52,809 --> 00:26:55,120
feasible or not

639
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,310
that's what matters for some of us in

640
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,489
the physical layer of the device you

641
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,929
know subsystem industry is it pliable or

642
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,300
not is it feasible or not to make it

643
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:07,450
pluggable some are thinking OS FP could

644
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:10,270
be the right form factor maybe not if

645
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:11,680
it's not feasible then the whole market

646
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,060
and the industry dynamics both

647
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,890
technically and also from the business

648
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,320
model standpoint will change when having

649
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,900
non pluggable optics for many of us and

650
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,540
if it is of course you know how do you

651
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,130
implement it thermal requirements what

652
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,820
is the electrical interface look like

653
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:26,620
and so on

654
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,629
and this work going in that direction as

655
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:32,199
well already the I Triple E is now

656
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:35,440
defining a 100g pam-4 electrical

657
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,050
interface in in the new task task force

658
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,600
802 the 3ck alright so this is actually

659
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:44,700
a single electrical line running at 100g

660
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,699
Ethernet now using palm for modulation

661
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,260
alright so that was it thank you so much

662
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,490
I think we have a few minutes for

663
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,490
questions not too many sorry

664
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:07,189
Allen Hannon CrowdStrike you could talk

665
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,249
you said several times in your

666
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,970
presentation that they'd be here in a

667
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:23,489
couple years

668
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:24,659
do you promise yes some of us are more

669
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:26,820
aggressive than others in the industry

670
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:28,559
we need to remember is that these optics

671
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:31,408
are hard to predict than some of the

672
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,330
other you know digital electronic

673
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:35,729
digital digital electronic design this a

674
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,070
lot of innovation needs to happen in

675
00:28:35,729 --> 00:28:43,070
optics and optics tend not to follow

676
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:43,070
Moore's law so so

677
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:51,960
all right thank you so much

678
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:01,169
you
