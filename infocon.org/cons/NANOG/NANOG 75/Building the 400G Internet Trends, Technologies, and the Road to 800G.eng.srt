1
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:16,580
so I looked I've reduced in age and then

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,840
gained a little bit of weight

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,729
unfortunately and II couldn't be here

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,910
today I know a lot of you were probably

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,490
looking forward to hearing his talk but

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,430
he broke his arm skiing if only we could

7
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,299
all ski so aggressively at that age so I

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,580
wanted to talk about 400 gig and 800 gig

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,620
Ethernet and optics especially in the

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:41,940
context of how the internet will be

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:45,629
built over the next couple of years the

12
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,339
first thing I'm gonna stay over here I

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,820
guess the first thing that we would note

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,540
is that there's a big transition that's

15
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,070
that's about to happen I think

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,850
everybody's probably well aware of this

17
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,380
at this point the 400 gig Ethernet

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:00,600
transition has begun

19
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:03,030
they're already shipping products with

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,739
400 gig and people often ask you know

21
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,690
how do we get faster in the internet the

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,880
first thing we could say is by just

23
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,200
going faster and this it sounds a bit

24
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,048
cheeky but the point of it is to say

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,510
that as new technology becomes available

26
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:17,460
we continue to increase the speed of

27
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,530
interfaces both on the electrical side

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,270
and the optical side and we want to

29
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,100
increase the speed as much as we can

30
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,869
vertically rather than horizontally as

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,890
long as we can track against Moore's Law

32
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:32,150
the new technology learning curve cannot

33
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:34,560
be such that it's dependent upon a

34
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:36,689
significant amount of cost upfront to be

35
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,900
borne by early adopters this isn't just

36
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:41,669
a claim to make about technology in our

37
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,650
space but it's a claim to make about

38
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:44,430
technology in all spaces when you think

39
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,439
about high-volume

40
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,960
early adopters they're not going to buy

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,669
into a new technology that costs more

42
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,309
than the existing technology especially

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,720
at volume the technology the cost of

44
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,070
that technology must be such that

45
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,350
there's an advantage to move there and

46
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,839
that should be obvious but it hasn't

47
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,729
been at least until recently both with

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,020
the rise of merchants silicon and the

49
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,360
increase in capacity and the

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,639
availability of advanced digital signal

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,329
processing and other modulation

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:14,279
advantages in the DSP level that allow

53
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:17,220
for this type of enhancement and that

54
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,109
this type of acceleration of of new

55
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,060
technology at the appropriate price

56
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:21,800
points so when we think about what's

57
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,080
happened

58
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,210
over the time looking at 40 gig to 100

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,940
gig and then to 400 gig we can see that

60
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:30,410
the 40 gig ramp began in 2014

61
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,050
well that's at least when the technology

62
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:35,720
became available in Mass 2015 was

63
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:38,510
relatively light and then by 2016 we had

64
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,820
a pretty large amount of 40 gig and then

65
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,859
at that same time 2016 the hundred gate

66
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,810
capability came online and it only took

67
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:47,600
about a year for a hundred gig to

68
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,160
surpass 40 gig port shipments and then

69
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,650
now we're starting to see that

70
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,880
accelerate even still and then if you

71
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,730
look at the bottom right of the chart

72
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:58,340
here you can see that in 2019 into 2020

73
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:00,019
we'll start to see 400 gig ramped up but

74
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,880
note that 100 gig capacity and a hundred

75
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,260
gate port counts will still be very high

76
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,930
I think everybody's probably aware that

77
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:08,090
40 gig was a short-lived experiment and

78
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,440
we'll see why in a moment if you look at

79
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:11,960
it differently you'll see the same thing

80
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,050
in this case 20 million ports are

81
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,790
estimated to be shipping by 2019 in

82
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,200
terms of both 40 gig and hundred gig but

83
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,940
the vast majority of them are hundred

84
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,589
gig and this is because they're more

85
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,300
cost-effective right it's more

86
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,580
cost-effective it's more power efficient

87
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:27,590
to use 100 gig than 40 gig and the

88
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,480
optical capacity or the cable

89
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,700
infrastructure I should say in most of

90
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,859
the large data centers support a

91
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,690
transition from 40 gig to 100 gig and as

92
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,760
we'll see using the same cable

93
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:43,700
infrastructure the transition to 400 gig

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,769
as well now 400 gig ramp in Ethernet

95
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,200
ports for switches and data centers is

96
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:49,490
expected to be somewhat less aggressive

97
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,359
than the hundred gig ramp and I'll

98
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,010
explain why in a moment

99
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,220
especially the differentiation between

100
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,929
the transponder based long-haul optics

101
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,790
and the data center non transponder

102
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,500
based optics or the short reach optics

103
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,630
and that's largely because the systems

104
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,790
are just coming online this year and

105
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:07,340
there's already a there was such an

106
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:09,170
aggressive ramp and 400 gig that I'm

107
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,610
sorry 100 gig that the 400 gig ramp will

108
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:12,109
take a little bit longer but will

109
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:14,150
eventually get to a similar point you

110
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,510
can see here that over the course of 3

111
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,890
years we go from less than a thousand

112
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,959
I'm sorry less than a million four

113
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,490
hundred gate ports and then by 2022

114
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,440
we'll see up the 10 million ports or

115
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,660
more that will be shipping but by then

116
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,900
as you'll soon find out we'll be looking

117
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:31,910
at 800 gig and of course the reasons

118
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,370
qualification new systems and new optics

119
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,150
available for gig optics will likely

120
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,340
start to become of

121
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,320
they're already sampling now most of the

122
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,719
vendors out there have 400 examples in

123
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,400
their labs and in their in their testing

124
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:45,740
environments 400 optics will be shipping

125
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,969
shipping this year 400 systems are

126
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,010
already shipping but not all of the

127
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,170
systems so this is the time for this

128
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,000
type of inflexion to take place now the

129
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,190
vast majority of 400 gig will take place

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,280
in the cloud and this is kind of

131
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,410
expected I mean there are I think more

132
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,510
than 10 million upwards of 20 million I

133
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:04,490
should say but 10 million cloud

134
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,750
datacenter ports 100 airports in

135
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:08,510
deployment at this point it's probably

136
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:09,740
more towards 15 million that's an

137
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,420
estimate of course nobody knows exactly

138
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,940
how many there are

139
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,650
so you can see that the large the vast

140
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,469
preponderance of deployments will be in

141
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:20,419
the cloud the rest of cloud is also

142
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,650
includes service providers and then of

143
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,090
course the large enterprises are the

144
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,400
ones that are shown in the pink here so

145
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:27,380
you know cloud will represent almost 90

146
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,450
or more percent of the total 400 gig

147
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,870
shipments over the next four years as

148
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,360
expected so this indicates a couple of

149
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:38,110
things one where is the volume and spend

150
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,490
and where is the technology going to be

151
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,830
focused around that will drive this

152
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,870
volume of spend because the volume and

153
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,490
the highest volume of spend well then of

154
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:48,140
course drive the prices down and get you

155
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,870
the most bang for your buck if you

156
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,270
pursue a particular technology and what

157
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,130
I'm going to get to is you'll see is

158
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:57,469
that we're at the precipice of being

159
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:59,810
able to do both client-side optics or

160
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,090
data center style optics and long haul

161
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,220
coherent optics in the same footprint in

162
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,599
the same pluggable at the same power

163
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,880
envelope or at least within a power

164
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,850
envelope that is supported in a typical

165
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,770
system one last point here on the

166
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,780
crossover point which is I think he

167
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,659
probably Kiefer some people's thinking

168
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:19,369
about when they should engage if you

169
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,950
know we're still deploying 400 gig and

170
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,560
mass and the amount of total you know

171
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,479
bandwidth shipped in terabits again

172
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,670
multiplied by a thousand so we're you

173
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,930
know 4.4 million terabytes of capacity

174
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:35,210
shipped eventually at 2020 at this point

175
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:37,400
around in 2019 were about half that

176
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,650
about two million terabytes per second

177
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,030
of capacity shipped and that's kind of

178
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,039
where you sort of see it flattening off

179
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,469
and hundred gig while the 400 ramp with

180
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,110
ramps and then by 2020 that's where we

181
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,879
think that 400 gig will surpass

182
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,979
the shipments of 100 Gig and that's

183
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,650
about the same time that we'll start to

184
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:58,128
investigate the 800 gig path that will

185
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:59,780
come next now in order to get to 800 gig

186
00:06:58,129 --> 00:07:01,940
we need to get beyond 50 Giga bits per

187
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:05,090
second sur des and 50 gig sur des are

188
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,370
just becoming available now on on NP use

189
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,859
and on Asics which is really the way we

190
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,210
want to drive the optical systems

191
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,340
directly because we want to have

192
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:15,198
effectively a one-to-one capacity

193
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,690
between electrical lanes from the chip

194
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,129
and the optical lanes on the fiber this

195
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:20,930
avoids us from having to deal with gear

196
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:24,020
boxes which are power-hungry consume

197
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,669
power of course and are costly so if you

198
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,620
can see this is a bit blurry I'm not

199
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,599
sure why this came out this way the

200
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:31,280
orange portion of the graph is 10

201
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,069
gigabits 'red as that was the technology

202
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,460
of choice for some time then more

203
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:39,650
recently 25 gig sur des came online in

204
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,810
2015 and had and will continue to be

205
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,810
used for sometime 50 gig surveys are

206
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:47,750
coming online in 2018 and 19 this

207
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:50,449
changes the optical modulation that will

208
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:52,729
see on the lines for on I'm sorry on the

209
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:55,340
optical lanes themselves that will drive

210
00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:56,960
new standards in in in terms of optical

211
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,729
technology in the will have some impact

212
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,440
on interoperability we'll talk about

213
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,560
that in a moment but the hundred gate

214
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:06,169
sir des transition happens around 2020

215
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,960
to 2021 and this is where we start to

216
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:09,799
get into the 800 gig range with the same

217
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,068
modulation techniques and the same

218
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,979
number of lanes as we have in place for

219
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:17,120
both 100 gig and 400 games so you're

220
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:20,539
gonna see that we're moving from this

221
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,550
sort of hundred gig 400 800 gig not by

222
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,800
coming up with a more advanced or more

223
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,770
exotic modulation schemes but simply by

224
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,629
increasing the lane speed and that's the

225
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,110
key when we say the best way and the

226
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:35,270
fastest way to go faster is to go faster

227
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,789
now merchants silicon has grown at the

228
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:39,169
same pace and this if you look at this

229
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,598
pace here you can see we're at the point

230
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,218
now where 2x every 2 years which is

231
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,079
Moore's law so as long as we're tracking

232
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,000
along Moore's law and we're increasing

233
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,500
the capacity of merchants silicon this

234
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,910
indicates to us that we need to increase

235
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,620
the capacity of the optical lanes

236
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:53,180
themselves that means if we're going to

237
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,250
double two times every 2 years we should

238
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,380
increase the capacity of the optical

239
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,760
system about that rate or four times

240
00:08:57,380 --> 00:09:01,189
every four years which is where we are

241
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,000
today and another example here is with

242
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:04,550
the Curran

243
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,950
Jericho to chip from Jericho one-plus

244
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:09,199
from Broadcom five times the capacity

245
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:11,630
over two years is a significant leap the

246
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,430
same thing is similar on the tomahawk

247
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:16,220
family except it's more like two times

248
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,989
every two years so we're getting to this

249
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,550
point where in order for us to continue

250
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,660
to grow the internet whether it's in the

251
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,219
data center or the data center

252
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,170
interconnect we have to track along

253
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:26,300
Moore's law we have to take advantage of

254
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,610
these speed transitions well thin sur

255
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,969
des technology as well as in chip speeds

256
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,950
or in processing at the capacity now I

257
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,420
just want to briefly touch on the data

258
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,870
center optics because I think this is

259
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:40,280
the part that we see the volume or at

260
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,140
least a good portion of the volume so

261
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,670
therefore this gives us a bit of an idea

262
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,500
of what the economies will be driven by

263
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:46,790
I know that Christian before I'm the

264
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,380
other Christian by the way he spoke a

265
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,730
bit about data center optics so I'm

266
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,480
gonna try to make sure that we don't

267
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:56,690
overlap too much so there are a bunch of

268
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,610
standards everybody's aware I'm more of

269
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,200
a networking guy thanks most people here

270
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,690
who know me wouldn't necessarily

271
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,950
consider me to be an optics person I see

272
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:05,330
a four inch of gig interface and it's

273
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,550
four engine gigabits per second and I'm

274
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,720
happy with it but there are a lot of

275
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:10,280
different standards for a lot of

276
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,140
different reasons and for a lot of

277
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,000
different uses and of course one of the

278
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,040
biggest use or drivers behind the

279
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,200
different standards is the cost of the

280
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,030
capacity cost of the fiber and the cost

281
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,430
of the optical technology so effectively

282
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:25,370
you know we're trying to find a sweet

283
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,989
spot between distance costs and the

284
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,230
cable technology that we're using and of

285
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,880
course in some cases the splicing

286
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:33,770
requirements are the cost of splicing so

287
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,240
we have these different types of fibers

288
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,530
if you note here I'm sorry from all

289
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,020
different types of fibers different

290
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,170
types of optical schemes and different

291
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,970
reaches and modulations each one of

292
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,219
these as you'll see in a moment is an

293
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,410
evolution using the same infrastructure

294
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:51,020
and effectively these same technology

295
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:54,459
just four times faster as its previous

296
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:56,660
generation so for example and this is a

297
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:59,300
picture from Microsoft if you look at

298
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:01,610
the whole data center and ask yourself

299
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,589
where do you see 400 gig fitting given

300
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,480
the technology and that's in place today

301
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,670
in the capacity and the fibers that are

302
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,610
deployed it's everywhere so it starts

303
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:12,349
down at the Tor or at the server level

304
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,670
with you know Teheran turn currently

305
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,559
today we have a hundred gig CR for

306
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,169
copper op

307
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,600
we can go 200-400 gage CRA copper optics

308
00:11:17,169 --> 00:11:21,579
in the same distance for the most part

309
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,519
at the act relief layer then we go from

310
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:26,888
like four 100 Gig active optical cables

311
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:29,889
to 400 gig active optical cables the

312
00:11:26,889 --> 00:11:31,359
same technology there you know then as

313
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:34,839
you go up towards the spine layer then

314
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:38,019
you go from like 100 Gig CWDM CDW CWDM

315
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:41,019
for 200 gig fr for 4-inch gig afar for I

316
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:44,350
should say or 100 Gig parallel single

317
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:46,149
mode fiber to 400 gig dr4 and that 400

318
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:48,669
gr for of course and the fr 4 can be

319
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,939
broken out in 200 gig dr and hundred gig

320
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:50,919
ever

321
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:52,719
so we have the same technology available

322
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:57,449
to us as we go and the same thing for LR

323
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,649
for 400 gig VCO for long-haul the next

324
00:11:57,449 --> 00:12:01,209
standard that's coming from the OIF is

325
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,100
called four hundred gigs ER and that's

326
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:04,839
going to be the focus of my talk for the

327
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,209
remainder because this is where we

328
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:08,829
finally get to the ability to have an

329
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:11,049
optical component that's pluggable

330
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:14,410
standards-based interoperable across

331
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:16,179
multiple vendors ultra long reach and

332
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,329
what we're talking about here as I just

333
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:23,199
as a prelude is imagine thousand

334
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:27,939
kilometers coherent technology in 20

335
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:29,199
Watts envelope unrepeated so this is the

336
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:31,539
technology that we're talking about for

337
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:35,049
the future and so I wanted to talk about

338
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:37,660
this at length so what is 100 gigs ER

339
00:12:35,049 --> 00:12:40,749
and zr+ as I mentioned it's the first

340
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,009
multi vendor DWDM standard standardized

341
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:43,809
through the OIF so you know

342
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:46,089
traditionally this long-haul business is

343
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:47,618
the domain of the optical vendors the

344
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:49,600
line side system vendors are the line

345
00:12:47,619 --> 00:12:51,519
system vendors and so there's a lot of

346
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,069
proprietary technology there a lot of

347
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,589
high power technology certainly some

348
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:58,238
advanced physics are in play in some of

349
00:12:56,589 --> 00:13:02,139
these ultra long-haul systems in some of

350
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:04,419
these line systems but it's been a boon

351
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:06,399
to the vendors the optical vendors and

352
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:07,899
it's been a bane if you will to the

353
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,819
operators because the operators then

354
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:12,600
don't really have the same freedom and

355
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:15,189
flexibility that you have as you know

356
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,079
with you you know in the what you have

357
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:18,608
in the case of Ethernet for example in

358
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:19,899
routers and switches that you can either

359
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:23,109
come you know buy commercially or

360
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:26,079
through an OEM or whatever may be their

361
00:13:23,109 --> 00:13:27,730
coherent tunable pluggable so this is a

362
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,130
big deal as well because now we if you

363
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,390
have the

364
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:32,700
packaging you can take a pluggable optic

365
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:35,459
or at least a package port in a switch

366
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,890
and plug a short reach data center optic

367
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:40,229
in it pull it out and plug alone ultra

368
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:42,420
long reach or a long reach coherent

369
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:43,260
optic to drive across a metro or even

370
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,180
across a country

371
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,589
as I'll show you in a moment four

372
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,660
hundred three hundred two hundred one

373
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,790
hundred gig speeds so this is a you know

374
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,170
of course the distance bandwidth product

375
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,250
we can play around with this based on

376
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,490
the Shannon limit and what we have

377
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:58,459
available on the fiber and because it's

378
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,990
so dense and because the power so low

379
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:03,300
you know the next generation optical

380
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:07,380
modules for four hundred gig the OSF P

381
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:11,370
and Q SF p DD standards allow up to

382
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:12,480
thirty six ports for one rack unit so

383
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,730
you'd say to yourselves well that's

384
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,010
great but if I can't cool the thing or I

385
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,779
have to alternate or checkerboard the

386
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:20,279
optics because the capacity of the

387
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:22,350
system the power is not available for

388
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:24,570
example or the heat dissipation is is

389
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,800
risky then you don't get the full

390
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:27,690
capacity of the system so you don't get

391
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,370
the savings that you'd want but in our

392
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:31,920
case and this is something that's easily

393
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:37,560
demonstrable we can plug in for example

394
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,390
36 Zr plus optics at 20 watts per optic

395
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,189
and drive that system we've done all the

396
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,680
simulations and actually done whatever

397
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,899
testing we can do with existing samples

398
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,910
we can drive that technology at the

399
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,190
capacity the thermal capacity of the

400
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:52,410
system without any major issue the only

401
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:54,510
issue of course becomes things like nebs

402
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:56,819
where you know once you're at that kind

403
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:58,920
of heat capacity or heat dissipation and

404
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,560
that type of power on the system then

405
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,760
it's questionable how much power and

406
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,430
that's how much heat you can dissipate

407
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,560
by spinning fans at certain decibel

408
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:09,540
levels you know you have acoustic noise

409
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,029
issues and things like this but for non

410
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,800
nebs applications or for environments

411
00:15:12,029 --> 00:15:15,750
where you can avoid some of the acoustic

412
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,180
noise challenges with nebs then you can

413
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:21,390
envision a system like a modular chassis

414
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,699
something with 16 slots in it 36 ports

415
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,220
of 400 Giggsy are our optics or zr+

416
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,089
optics driving all the long distance now

417
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,399
of course that would be an unusual

418
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,810
configuration unless it was like a mega

419
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,430
core router in the middle of the ocean

420
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,589
or something like that but you certainly

421
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,089
can envision the worst case scenario and

422
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:38,970
that's something the capacity that we

423
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,290
support today and it's a 20 watt power

424
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,060
envelope i don't want to get into too

425
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,900
much of the debate between QSF

426
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:48,239
pdd-nos FP but 20 watts is higher and

427
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,890
that will allow us to go to Zr plus and

428
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,120
we think in the future we'll get us the

429
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,630
eight hundred gigs er when we have a

430
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,040
hundred gig MSA 100 gigs sur des on the

431
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,890
next generation systems that'll come out

432
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,810
21 in 2021

433
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:02,610
now there's a huge cost reduction at

434
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:05,430
play here as a result of this new

435
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,690
technology because the optics are

436
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,589
plugged well first let me try to explain

437
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:09,210
this chart because it's a bit

438
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,760
multi-dimensional so on the Left we have

439
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,920
shipments and thousands on the right we

440
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,720
have the cost in thousands per port and

441
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,300
on the bottom there's the total number

442
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,240
of shipments for both hundred gig 200

443
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,370
and 300 400 gig optics with - 250 + 3 +

444
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:25,500
400 and you can see that the average

445
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:27,360
sales price 400 gig has been you know of

446
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,840
course dropping over time starting in

447
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,490
2012 at about $90,000 per port and now

448
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,050
it's down to about 20 thousand dollars

449
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,450
per port and this is for traditional

450
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:39,150
packaged optics st. so this would be

451
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,910
something like a CFP and the same thing

452
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,680
for 208 for CF p2 or C packs you know in

453
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,680
the previous case as well and then for

454
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,750
educate with CF p8 as an example this is

455
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,699
the cost of a sort of packaged topic

456
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:52,140
optic without the pluggable kit of

457
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,730
nature that you get with the economies

458
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:55,860
of scale that you get in data center

459
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,010
optics but with economies of scale and

460
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:01,710
Zr with OSF p or q SFPD d let's just use

461
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:04,500
OSF P for now we get down to about $10

462
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:07,110
per gigabit per second so that's a order

463
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,839
of magnitude reduction in cost for the

464
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:12,000
same capacity in the network with the

465
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,709
density that you'd expect to find in a

466
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,310
large-scale dense system that you'd put

467
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:19,020
in a data center now there's a lot of

468
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,129
standards in reach I want to go through

469
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:22,290
all of them here's a bit of an eye chart

470
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,380
but what we have is you know the typical

471
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:29,460
client interfaces 400 gig - by 200 gig

472
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:31,050
for 500 gig or ot you for the framing

473
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,920
we'll go through the whole list of them

474
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,680
here but a typical

475
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:36,870
I - framing Zoro AF framing the zr1 is

476
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:39,630
for example is one of them I Triple E

477
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:41,159
802 3 CK so when you'll find widely use

478
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:42,060
open Rotom stuff that's starting to come

479
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,700
out in some of the long haul

480
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:46,500
applications modulation schemes are ones

481
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,900
that we all know and love

482
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,330
mostly qualms and QPSK for the long haul

483
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,860
stuff especially and then the reach and

484
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,419
this is the big one if you notice here

485
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,129
and if everybody could read this in the

486
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,929
back

487
00:17:55,130 --> 00:18:00,860
but the reach goes from 100 kilometers

488
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:03,679
for 400 gig at 16 qualm to up to 8,000

489
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,379
kilometers at 100 get QPSK this is on a

490
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,870
single optic that's about the size of I

491
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,010
don't know the size of a kazoo or

492
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:16,580
something like that you know it's about

493
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:17,629
the size of an optic so it's I mean this

494
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,250
is amazing right you don't need a

495
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,080
transponder anymore you just need a CT

496
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:23,120
of course you need a MUX but you don't

497
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,428
need a transponder to drive a signal

498
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,989
across an ocean at a hundred gig so this

499
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:29,210
is I think gonna have a big impact in

500
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:30,590
network designs for service providers

501
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,740
and for operators who are building

502
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,510
long-haul networks so as an example some

503
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:37,250
use cases for DCI that's an obvious one

504
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,710
we're seeing more and more even sort of

505
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,929
the Metro DCI where we have DC data

506
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,450
centers in metros and the leaf spine

507
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:46,340
topologies are spanning the data centers

508
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,080
so it's not just like an aggregation

509
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:50,959
layer or some ring between data centers

510
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:53,389
it's actually the act of the leaf spine

511
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,860
ecmp fan-out is going you know you might

512
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,179
have some spines in one data center and

513
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,879
leaves spread through multiple data

514
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:01,340
centers and those links are those links

515
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,200
are going up into this this data center

516
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,750
that's in a different location across

517
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,360
these DCI interfaces same thing with

518
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,190
Metro reach DWDM we're started you know

519
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,080
obviously a lot of ring technologies out

520
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,270
there today for Metro one of the things

521
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,220
that we see examples of is ring

522
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:19,850
technology that leverage several

523
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,200
leverages segment routing with ti LFA so

524
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:23,090
you can do effectively zero touch

525
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,320
provision so you can you know imagine a

526
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,480
ring that's about a hundred kilometers

527
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,270
in diameter they'll typically be one

528
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,830
long you know sort of stretch especially

529
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,450
depending on how it's being built but

530
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,889
typically there's you know starting

531
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,720
point and then you start to touch a

532
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,799
couple of different nodes buildings or

533
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:39,350
whatever they are and then you go around

534
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,389
a big loop and that that end of the loop

535
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,500
is typically a very long reach loop so

536
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,590
you need to have something that can go

537
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,880
maybe 80 or 100 kilometers you also need

538
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,649
to be able to break the ring open and

539
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,270
put it back together and insert new

540
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,830
nodes and dynamically reprovision

541
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:53,379
so this is another use case that we

542
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:56,240
think is going to be quite interesting

543
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,409
of course long we reach DWDM I'll show

544
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,250
you a couple examples in a moment

545
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,290
because that's exciting

546
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:04,220
and then 5g aggregation and r5 for cable

547
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,168
obviously this is something that's big

548
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,890
and top of mind for everybody

549
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:09,809
5g

550
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,760
poor ports and depending on what you who

551
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:14,580
you believe in what kind of soothsayer

552
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,320
you trust could potentially increase the

553
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,370
capacity over the next five to ten years

554
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:22,080
by sixty X and that's not just a 5g

555
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,149
itself the applications that it enables

556
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,370
so if you're talking about you know

557
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:28,018
something like AR and VR which are the

558
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,529
ones that really look to drive the

559
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,340
technology that requires almost

560
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,559
intrinsically requires a mobile

561
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,059
interface if it's going to be useful now

562
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,158
the way everything's been done to date

563
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:40,649
is the mobile interface your phone acts

564
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,330
effectively like a Wi-Fi hotspot maybe a

565
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:44,428
4G hotspot is a better way of saying it

566
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:45,658
but more and more these devices are

567
00:20:44,429 --> 00:20:47,549
going to become connected themselves so

568
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:49,380
this is the Internet of Things and with

569
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:51,059
5g that bandwidth will increase so if

570
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,110
you have some kind of a hourglasses they

571
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,850
may not be connected to your phone

572
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,279
anymore they're connected directly so

573
00:20:53,850 --> 00:21:00,120
that's another example now I mentioned

574
00:20:56,279 --> 00:21:01,710
that the WDM long-haul is one potential

575
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,719
application so here's an example of the

576
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,010
internet 200 gig research network it's a

577
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,750
proposed network I don't think this has

578
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:10,049
been done yet but if you just look at

579
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:12,570
the map and if anybody here is roughly

580
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:14,279
familiar with u.s. geography you can see

581
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:15,899
there may be only one or two places in

582
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:19,169
the whole network that particularly the

583
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:21,330
trans Montana North Dakota Bozeman to

584
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:22,889
Fargo link it's probably the only link

585
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:25,049
that exceeds a thousand kilometers here

586
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:27,000
modulo one or two others and in those

587
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:29,039
cases you could put repeaters or maybe

588
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,299
you just put another node somewhere in

589
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,649
the middle I don't know where in that

590
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,220
case you would do it Sioux Falls or

591
00:21:31,649 --> 00:21:34,620
something like that

592
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:36,570
and then the rest of the links are just

593
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,518
direct shots so you just plug the optic

594
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:39,990
and plug it into the MUX forget about

595
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:43,380
the transponder it's already built in

596
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:45,269
and you drive it across the the long

597
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,309
distance now I'd also note that those

598
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:49,350
optics is our standard based so you're

599
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:51,539
going to I have standard so you can get

600
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:53,459
them from multiple vendors so the Locken

601
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:55,379
that used to have on the long haul where

602
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,659
one side had to be the same as the other

603
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:01,889
on the at least on the line side is gone

604
00:21:59,659 --> 00:22:04,049
likewise the case with Europe in fact

605
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:06,539
Europe all of Europe can be covered if

606
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:09,960
you count or if you exclude some of the

607
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:12,389
farther reaches in northern Scandinavia

608
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:17,100
all of Europe can be covered by hundred

609
00:22:12,389 --> 00:22:18,209
gig I'm sorry by 400 gig zr+ because all

610
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,469
the distances between all the major

611
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,850
cities is less than a thousand

612
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:23,670
so here's an example of a pan-european

613
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:26,490
network that can be built using this

614
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:29,040
technology without any DWDM of Rotom

615
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:31,800
based transponders and the same thing

616
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:33,659
goes for Asia so across most of Japan in

617
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,210
ters you know the Asian region the

618
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,310
southern Southeast Asian region that you

619
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:40,530
see in the C block over there and then

620
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,450
the D block itself with the exception of

621
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:44,850
some of the links between Australia and

622
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,680
New Zealand and the farther reaches in

623
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:48,780
the northern part of the Pacific and of

624
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:50,670
course across the Pacific towards North

625
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,980
America and South America all of those

626
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:57,750
links sub C can be covered by this

627
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:59,160
technology and if it's not 400 gig at at

628
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,710
a thousand kilometers it could be tuned

629
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,530
down to 300 gig at 2,000 kilometers or

630
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:07,260
200 gig at 4,000 kilometers or 100k to

631
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,930
8,000 kilometers so you can paralyze the

632
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:11,760
link so we always have to deal with this

633
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,260
Shannon limit and the Nyquist concerns

634
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,900
that we have with distance and bandwidth

635
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,640
as we know signal noise ratio be damned

636
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,430
but these are the things that we can do

637
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,900
now with this new technology

638
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:24,510
so why the pluggable form factor there

639
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,100
are there is I think everybody here who

640
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,540
spends any time looking in optics under

641
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,060
knows that there's onboard optics

642
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:32,700
technology that's being proposed that

643
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,750
would increase the density you know

644
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,660
obviously increases performance

645
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:38,370
efficiency but you lose the ability and

646
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,490
the flexibility of being able to to go

647
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:45,120
pluggable the most important reason why

648
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,230
customers want modular well there's a

649
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,969
couple of reasons one of them is to

650
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,590
avoid margin stacking which is where you

651
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,030
know you have multiple players in the in

652
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,830
the in the food chain and we're all

653
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:55,649
taking a bit of margin and this was the

654
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:57,899
case for example with the CFP technology

655
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,300
and that's why the cost that we're

656
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,310
showing for zr+ optics is so

657
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,710
dramatically different than the cost of

658
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,300
existing CFPA technology so CFPA

659
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:07,440
technology I think I referenced

660
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,399
something like ten thousand dollars of

661
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,070
port whereas the cost for zr+

662
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:16,290
can be as low as $1,000 support let's

663
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:17,730
say a system vendor can build one system

664
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:19,680
design this is about per optic by the

665
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:21,090
way and this is that volume the system

666
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,980
vendor can build one system design so

667
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,990
there's no extra investment required to

668
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,630
deliver this DCO technology you don't

669
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,370
need a separate line system or a

670
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,320
transponder shelf or whatever it is it's

671
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:32,060
literally one component so all the

672
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,460
system vendors

673
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:35,960
merchant vendors this custom vendors the

674
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,390
ODMs the white box vendors can all

675
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,280
leverage the same technology you can mix

676
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:41,300
and match DCL and klein optics this is

677
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,879
probably the biggest one is certainly

678
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,830
big for data centers but networks are

679
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,930
being built in a scale out way so it's

680
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,699
not just routers that through this and

681
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:51,650
routers that do that and switches over

682
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,540
here and then leaf switches and spine

683
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:55,400
switches they're all starting to blend

684
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,800
together in a horizontally scaled

685
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,390
fashion so you'll see more and more and

686
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,610
more that you'll have switches deployed

687
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,620
in data centers that are leaves that

688
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,540
have client optics towards the spines

689
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,280
and then have a mix of client optics

690
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,409
towards local servers or local attach

691
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,399
especially in the telco space but then

692
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,720
you may have some like for example

693
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,960
imagine a data center that's built

694
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,760
inside a central office like a MEC data

695
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,470
center you could have some local

696
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,970
attached servers and then you might have

697
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,930
some longer reach optics that go into

698
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:26,330
subtending central offices or out to RFI

699
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:28,340
hubs and nodes or out to you know 5g

700
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:29,600
backhaul sites so you're gonna need this

701
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:32,870
flexibility and you don't want to have

702
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,000
to buy a co packaged optical Sarika

703
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:37,459
package line card with Co package optics

704
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,650
that only have one specific style or

705
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,870
type because you lose flexibility and

706
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:43,790
then there's a lot of different SKUs

707
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:44,959
that we can expect as a result of what I

708
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:46,940
mentioned before all these different

709
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,490
types of you know considerations around

710
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,050
distance and and cost and the fiber type

711
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,700
and what you're evolving to and all

712
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:56,450
these other concerns that people who

713
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:57,770
build big data centers have so the

714
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,860
transition as I mentioned it we think

715
00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:04,040
that will go towards OSF P and Q SFPD D

716
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:06,100
I think Arista it should be clear

717
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,320
although we have as a company been

718
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,490
proponents of OSF P because we see the

719
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,439
value of being able to transition

720
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,990
forward to 800 gig and to support the

721
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,600
higher power envelope that we can find

722
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:21,320
in an OS F P module we also support Q

723
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,449
SFPD D so the roadmap to eight hundred

724
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,179
gigs er this is an important one because

725
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,470
I think people ask right now I think

726
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,390
there was a bit of a debate the weather

727
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:31,430
was going to go from 400 gig to 1 T I

728
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:33,950
think that debate is largely settled

729
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:35,480
there are 1t capable systems I think

730
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,270
they're largely proprietary on the line

731
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:41,000
side the oef/oif meeting that's

732
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,010
occurring right now in Arizona I think

733
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,130
and I don't

734
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:47,020
be the first to break the news but I

735
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,340
think that the larger agreement is that

736
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,740
800 gig will be the next speed

737
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,480
transition if that's a case then we have

738
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,600
the technology available to us right

739
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,510
away by just increasing the lane speed

740
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,090
from the service capacity from 56

741
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:04,870
gigabits per second to 112 or from 50 to

742
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:07,330
100 same power and Volokh for 100 gigs

743
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,979
er the longer haul will be it you know

744
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,210
something that we have to check and see

745
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,250
how that'll work but at least see our

746
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,530
optics eight hundred gigs er will work

747
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:17,770
within the existing OS FP power envelope

748
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,080
so that means you can get 800 gig lesson

749
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,310
you know about a hundred kilometres

750
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,980
probably a couple of hundred kilometres

751
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:26,560
based on enhancements and perhaps some

752
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,450
technological advantages or advances I

753
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,300
should say that some of the vendors are

754
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:32,770
making to the DSPs but it's possible to

755
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:34,419
be able to build a network today with

756
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:37,570
existing technology the technology

757
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,330
that's coming out now using OS f p or q

758
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:41,980
SF peepers particularly OS FP and then

759
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:45,820
be able to transition directly to 800

760
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:48,610
gig when the technologies arrives just

761
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,530
to summarise on the zr+ piece because

762
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,169
this is the real key here it's the first

763
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:57,280
true multi vendor interoperable D Co

764
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,840
standard there was some hundred gig sort

765
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,340
of standard floated I think Peter laughs

766
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:02,470
Berg and some others put something

767
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,909
together with the staircase vac and it

768
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,380
had some traction but it's not quite the

769
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,450
same thing as having a full-on Hawaii F

770
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,160
speck so this is a multi vendor

771
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,010
interoperable standard it's been tested

772
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,530
it's been demonstrated at aqaq and at

773
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:16,660
ofc ittle UFC's in two weeks you can go

774
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:18,250
there and check it out again the

775
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,780
revolutionary price performance is just

776
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,940
unmatched to be able to get down under a

777
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,550
couple of thousand dollars per ten

778
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:26,170
gigabits at this point it's just

779
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:27,490
revolutionary or you're thinking out I'm

780
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,440
sorry for a four hundred Giga it's a

781
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:32,190
it's so different I mean we're looking

782
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,440
at the potential to have zr optics at

783
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:36,670
four hundred gig at the at a couple of

784
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,800
thousand dollars depending on your

785
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:41,440
volume and this is like now like in this

786
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:43,570
year not next year in the year after low

787
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,210
power so this means you can really pack

788
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:48,010
in in a line card a lot of capacity if

789
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,380
you think about the NP you you know the

790
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,940
power that it's imagined of one unit one

791
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,950
in rack unit line card or one rack unit

792
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,909
system how much power does it need to

793
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,249
you know and

794
00:28:54,909 --> 00:28:58,929
much power can you put in Iraq well it's

795
00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:00,940
20 watts for the optics and you get 36

796
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:03,879
ports that's 720 watts

797
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,200
then the npu is gonna be 500 watts or

798
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:06,998
there abouts between three and five

799
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,210
hundred watts depending how many there

800
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:11,529
are for example so you know when you add

801
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:13,809
everything together the fans the

802
00:29:11,529 --> 00:29:16,779
connections the CPU the NP use the

803
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:19,090
optics and you're about 2,000 watts per

804
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:20,679
slot and if you imagine that were per

805
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,119
rack unit so that gets you about eighty

806
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:25,919
eight hundred eight it's our eighty

807
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:28,090
eight thousand watts per rack

808
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,529
approximately so this is starting to

809
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:32,349
stretch the capacity of cooling

810
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:35,080
technology today but it is possible

811
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:39,849
mmm-hmm I mean it's only eighty eight

812
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:43,449
thousand watts anybody up for liquid

813
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:45,729
cooling at this point pluggable form

814
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:47,409
factor eliminates a separate separate

815
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:48,549
transport self and this is something

816
00:29:47,409 --> 00:29:50,559
that people have wanted for a long time

817
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:52,479
this is really the real deal here

818
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,789
because it's not just the metro it's the

819
00:29:52,479 --> 00:29:56,710
long haul at this point as well no

820
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:57,940
special of course system designs where

821
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,559
you have to have you know special

822
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,609
dispersion compensators and things of

823
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:05,289
that nature

824
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:08,769
in the network to do the DCO aspects and

825
00:30:05,289 --> 00:30:11,830
I think we can definitely get to zr+ 800

826
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:13,779
gig in 2020 to 2023 timeframe so this is

827
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,489
investment protection I think whatever

828
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:17,889
investment people are going to make over

829
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:19,269
the next couple of years especially you

830
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:20,678
know in the next two years and their

831
00:30:19,269 --> 00:30:22,779
systems because there's a lot of

832
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,489
next-generation system technology

833
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,830
available today and we know that these

834
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:28,389
typically last for many years and

835
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,070
sometimes as much as a decade this is

836
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:31,959
probably the right direction to go in

837
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:35,080
our view in order to meet the capacity

838
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,479
requirements of the future so I'm gonna

839
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,449
I think I'm gonna finish here is just a

840
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:41,529
couple more points I wanted to make this

841
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:45,669
is stuff that you already know this is

842
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:46,989
the octal small pluggable form factor so

843
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:48,399
it's eight 500 gig sir days in the

844
00:30:46,989 --> 00:30:51,039
future so you can get twenty eight point

845
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,439
eighty per unit in this up to 20 Watts I

846
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,629
mentioned this already QSF PDD I think

847
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,009
you guys have seen this as well fourteen

848
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:58,928
point four units per terabyte because

849
00:30:57,009 --> 00:31:02,139
it's not clear yet that QSF PDD can

850
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:04,119
support 800 gig just because of the

851
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:06,399
thermal characteristics of the system

852
00:31:04,119 --> 00:31:08,320
another piece here in terms of what we

853
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,000
think is better about OS FP and

854
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,320
spend too much time here because we're

855
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,620
not really taking a religious stance

856
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:17,320
here just an explanation of technology

857
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:18,518
this is 112 gig Pam for demonstration

858
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:20,289
that's aired as you can see the drift

859
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,450
here the signal drift and it's hard to

860
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:25,690
read that line there but the spacing we

861
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:29,620
get there 25 decibels signal noise ratio

862
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,630
at 28 gigahertz gives us like sort of a

863
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:33,729
demonstrable proof that we can do 112

864
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:36,130
gig on the existing technology so when

865
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,620
we have chipsets for example amp use

866
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,750
that can do 100 gig sur des will be

867
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:45,340
ready to plug these into these OS FP

868
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:46,360
form factor optics this is pretty much

869
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,240
the same thing I've been talking about

870
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,769
in terms of 20 watt capacity and then

871
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,330
this is the same thing going from 400

872
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:54,100
gig there's not at least today based on

873
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,928
the estimates there's not a significant

874
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,389
change in the power requirements or at

875
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:59,980
least a savings in power but there will

876
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:02,469
still be savings in the system because

877
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,139
to go from 400 to 800 gig it's half the

878
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:07,330
lasers it's double the density so even

879
00:32:05,139 --> 00:32:08,350
if we can't get a huge power savings

880
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,629
based on what we know about the

881
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:12,699
technology today we think we still can

882
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:14,529
get of system-wide savings because of no

883
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,919
we can get a system-wide savings because

884
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:19,629
we'll get advances in in switching

885
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,679
performance in ASIC performance and of

886
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:25,059
course the reduction in lasers so the

887
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,399
biggest challenge for operators is to

888
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,509
figure out how to concrete bandwidth for

889
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:30,699
the next gen applications without

890
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:33,279
increasing capex and optics in fact we'd

891
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,929
like to lower them and I think the key

892
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,250
is to you know the first thing that

893
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:37,480
Arista has done and if they a lot of

894
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,279
people the industry you recognize this

895
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,990
is you know look at merchants silicon as

896
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,139
a way to step into this space with

897
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,700
reduce the cost of R&D where we get a

898
00:32:44,139 --> 00:32:49,029
common set of technology that everybody

899
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:51,009
can use it at a commodity price and then

900
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:52,659
of course reducing the cost of DWDM and

901
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:54,580
long haul optics so for service riders

902
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:57,250
and operators who operate long-haul

903
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,350
networks but this is the second half of

904
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,149
that or the second side of that coin the

905
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,830
first side of the coin of reduction cost

906
00:33:01,149 --> 00:33:05,439
in our view is merchants silicon the

907
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,509
second side is of course these

908
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,789
high-speed long reach optics that our

909
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:11,980
pluggable it's easier to manage

910
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:13,690
everybody knows this right this is an

911
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,299
issue with ecmp in one case a lot of

912
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:18,429
more ports to configure a lot more

913
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:20,470
optics to provision so the faster

914
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,610
capacity that we can get the higher the

915
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:25,390
speed that easier it is the

916
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:27,549
manage and it's a lower cost so 400 gate

917
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:29,679
today just so to be clear even if you're

918
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:32,410
not ready for 400 gig today 400 gig

919
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,330
technology is half the cost per bit it's

920
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,080
half the power per bit double the

921
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:37,240
capacity

922
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:39,970
I was re four times the capacity for the

923
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,500
existing systems so it makes sense to

924
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:43,960
move to the stock technology even if

925
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,460
you're not fully ready to go 400 gig or

926
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,020
you don't have the capacity requirements

927
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,830
so it's something to consider when

928
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:50,920
you're starting to look at your new

929
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,809
systems so there's a huge improvement

930
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,640
for imbalance and price performance this

931
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:56,379
is key I think especially if we want to

932
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,440
reduce cost fundamentally more

933
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,510
cost-effective networks are also more

934
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,669
efficient and easy to manage so I think

935
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,049
this is a fundamental precept that I

936
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:06,790
think operators are starting to embrace

937
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:09,219
more and more and we think that we'll

938
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:11,560
have trials and production four-engine

939
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:14,230
gig this year and certainly in data

940
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,969
centers and then long-haul will start to

941
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:20,409
see that come online late this year and

942
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:28,678
early next year and that's it any

943
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:28,679
questions thank you

944
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,670
West Gorge with light grit apparently

945
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:38,120
it's my day to talk at me and Auggie hey

946
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:39,350
Wes good to you since you mentioned in a

947
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,509
number of different places in your talk

948
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:44,000
the server the challenges around power

949
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,040
and cooling I wanted to mention

950
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,030
something that it's come up in previous

951
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,469
discussions we've had with router

952
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:54,110
vendors about this exact problem give

953
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:57,049
some thought to names nebs extend it

954
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,290
specifically there are an awful lot of

955
00:34:57,050 --> 00:35:01,580
applications where nebs extended

956
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:02,990
compliance like we don't actually need

957
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,340
the box to keep running in those

958
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:07,160
temperature ranges mhm

959
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,380
and given the significant increase in

960
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,960
power or prior to drive fans fast enough

961
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:13,190
to keep it cool at those temperatures

962
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,130
having a mode where I can essentially

963
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:19,310
say turn yourself off if you get to this

964
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:22,190
temperature shutdown and dr8 the power

965
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:23,690
requirements accordingly there's a lot

966
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:25,940
of places where that would be pretty

967
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,320
useful yeah there are gonna be some

968
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,170
places where people say no I want this

969
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,670
box to run until it catches fire mm-hm

970
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:33,590
because this stuff is critical and it

971
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,940
has to keep running but there are also

972
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,720
lots of places where that really isn't

973
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:40,310
true and so that may be something you

974
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,470
know as this becomes more and more of an

975
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:44,240
issue in terms of the the power

976
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:46,180
requirements on the individual packages

977
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,939
it might be something to think about

978
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:52,970
yeah I think that was more of a like a

979
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,890
comment but if I can respond and one

980
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:56,180
thing I would say is you know that

981
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,670
technology exists today to have

982
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,740
different fan speeds we find that in

983
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,440
fact we've had this situation where we

984
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,899
we had an ABS concern on acoustic noise

985
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,600
lower the fan speeds but then they have

986
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,650
a like a cooling failure so then you

987
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,390
know the system shuts itself down

988
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:13,700
because you know it can't spin the fans

989
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:15,859
louder or we can spin and faster sorry

990
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,169
and louder but then that would violate

991
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:19,700
the nebs rules right so it's it's a

992
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,320
tricky one I think that the system event

993
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,870
what the only thing I was gonna say the

994
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,550
major response I was gonna make is and

995
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:27,529
this is self-serving so I'll preface it

996
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,300
with that be careful what you wish for

997
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,860
when you go after some of the OEM bass

998
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:32,660
white boxes because they typically are

999
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,090
an engineer for that type of flexibility

1000
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,069
so if you care about that and you're

1001
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:38,450
looking at white box just check check

1002
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,010
how they behave under different power

1003
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:44,509
stresses and under different

1004
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:47,450
environmental conditions yes I was

1005
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:50,720
wondering about the on the server side

1006
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:53,990
if there's any concern or if you're

1007
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,149
tracking the rates for the buses for

1008
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:57,770
being able to put in cards and what they

1009
00:36:56,150 --> 00:37:00,320
can support so you're talking about like

1010
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:01,970
PCI 4 and I haven't looked at it

1011
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,290
personally recently but if you want just

1012
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:04,310
shoot me a mail and I'll get you in

1013
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:07,070
touch with the right people who know

1014
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:09,529
that stuff really well I know you I know

1015
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:11,000
exactly we talking about I think the

1016
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:14,060
last I heard I don't even think it's

1017
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:16,280
part of ice Lake yet but let's assume it

1018
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:17,900
is but but that would be now this year

1019
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,910
and I think the transition was still

1020
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,810
some time so I'm not clear on it but

1021
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:26,240
I'll check Thanks yep one more pulpit

1022
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:27,799
injure Telstra I'm imagining that this

1023
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,109
technology is even more demanding than

1024
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:32,510
ever on fiber quality connector quality

1025
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:34,910
connector click DEP space to the lasers

1026
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:36,830
all that so are the vendors doing

1027
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,540
special tests and implementation modes

1028
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:40,190
to help you hook this all up and what

1029
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:42,619
role do these low-level transceivers

1030
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,880
play in that that's a good question I

1031
00:37:42,619 --> 00:37:45,619
don't have the answers for all the

1032
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,530
different optical types or all the

1033
00:37:45,619 --> 00:37:50,510
different connectors but the goal is to

1034
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,630
be able to enable this to work with the

1035
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:55,100
existing plant so that means that you

1036
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:57,470
know the existing MPO cables the

1037
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,509
existing single mode fiber you know om

1038
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,060
three om four each you know each one is

1039
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:04,580
different I think in the least in the

1040
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,700
data center case the fiber is new enough

1041
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:10,040
and clean enough with in the past that

1042
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:12,080
say five years or maybe even ten years

1043
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,359
to support this technology all they

1044
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:16,100
would all the way up to 800 gig but for

1045
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:19,340
outside plant that's a different story

1046
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,290
and of course your mileage will vary so

1047
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,520
I wish I could tell a better story but I

1048
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:26,029
mean some of the fiber in the ground is

1049
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:27,710
thirty years old or more right it looks

1050
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:28,940
like that's it well hey everybody thank

1051
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,859
you very much for staying late I know

1052
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,900
many of you wanted to see Andy but who

1053
00:38:30,859 --> 00:38:34,960
could it be

1054
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:34,960
you

1055
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,410
you
