1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:18,080
hello I'm margin from another lapse and

2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:19,670
about the question whether I should or

3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,270
but you should run your own

4
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,970
rpki certificate authority and like

5
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,340
every question worth asking the answer

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:31,340
to this one is a resounding well that

7
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:35,510
depends so maybe let's start with a more

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:38,210
easy question who's in our labs we are a

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:40,239
small foundation based in Amsterdam in

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:45,140
the Netherlands and we are developing

11
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:47,949
software and do research to support the

12
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:51,220
network operator community in their work

13
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:54,349
and we're hoping that with our software

14
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,839
it becomes so important to us that you

15
00:00:54,350 --> 00:01:00,830
also support our work and make sure that

16
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:03,409
we will be around again what

17
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,269
traditionally our work was in the DNS

18
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:07,640
these are probably the most well known

19
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,909
of our products but we've always also

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:15,170
been working in the routing security

21
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:17,990
field and so the last year we decided

22
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,810
that rpki has become important enough

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,030
and sort of present enough that maybe we

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,310
should look into supporting that with

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,780
some software of our own and so we

26
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:32,390
started two projects in the rpki field

27
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:34,520
which I will mention as I go along so

28
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:41,090
maybe let's start with a quick recap of

29
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:43,640
what rpki is it is short for resource

30
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,570
public key infrastructure which is

31
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,430
basically a system where holders of

32
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,869
internet numbering resources can make

33
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,630
statements about their use of these

34
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,010
resources that can be verified so their

35
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,170
statements can be verified that they're

36
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:59,420
actually from the people who hold these

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:02,030
resources currently this is pretty much

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:06,850
exclusively used for router rigid

39
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:09,080
validation or ROV but further uses are

40
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:14,769
possible and indeed envisioned one of

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:18,680
them is possibly path validation so

42
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:20,480
route origin validation basically the

43
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,829
statements that were doing in this field

44
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,739
is the holder of a resource announces

45
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:31,850
which autonomous systems the

46
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:34,190
I intend to announce routes for these

47
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:36,769
resources from these statements then are

48
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:42,700
called rat origin authorizations or ro

49
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:44,330
ass and then what happens is if you are

50
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:47,030
operating around or if you're

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,130
participating in the BGP thing then you

52
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,500
can collect these statements and produce

53
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,880
filters that you give to your routers

54
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,410
and these filters are basically done

55
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,030
deciding whether a new route or a route

56
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:02,329
announcement that you receive is valid

57
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:07,130
or invalid based on these statements or

58
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:09,800
if there is no such robot and they are

59
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:11,690
not found an important point here is it

60
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,900
should probably say that up front

61
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:17,030
that what this validation does is if

62
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,740
there's no statements then it doesn't do

63
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,810
anything with it so the filter will not

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:23,530
filter away routes for which they exist

65
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,530
nor Roiz

66
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:30,829
so to summarize the route origin

67
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:36,220
validation answers the question is a

68
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:39,410
certain BGP announcement indeed author

69
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,650
originated by someone who's authorized

70
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:47,090
to do that how does it work in practice

71
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:49,060
a pacaya is a public infrastructure so

72
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,300
there are certificates and stuff

73
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:57,740
specifically these certificates are

74
00:03:52,300 --> 00:04:01,070
following the path that routers are

75
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:02,780
sorry resource assignments take when it

76
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,970
comes to you so it all starts up with

77
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:06,920
the our IRS there's the five ones these

78
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:11,150
operate or this surface trust anchors

79
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,280
for the entire structure which means

80
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:15,530
that whenever you validate or verify a

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,738
certain announcement or a certain rower

82
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:20,600
you have to follow it all the way up to

83
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:23,030
one of these trust anchors then

84
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,450
depending on which region you're in

85
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,739
there might be national internet

86
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,849
registries and ultimately the

87
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:37,060
certificates will end up auntie holders

88
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:37,060
of resources which basically you guys

89
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:40,619
because there are certificates that

90
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,169
means there needs to be certificate

91
00:04:40,619 --> 00:04:45,180
authorities these are basically the ones

92
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:49,770
that create and sign both the

93
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,869
certificates and the rowers and because

94
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:54,119
it's a it's an actual public thing so

95
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:55,800
everyone needs to be able to gather all

96
00:04:54,119 --> 00:04:58,020
this information there is also a

97
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,229
necessity to publish to public eight

98
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,698
this things these things for practical

99
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:03,479
reasons these two functions have been

100
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,189
separated

101
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,589
so these certificate authority is

102
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:09,229
independent of the publication server so

103
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:11,699
you can run the certificate authority

104
00:05:09,229 --> 00:05:14,188
well in your basement hidden away and

105
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:17,069
just have the publication server exposed

106
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,809
to the entire Internet what that happens

107
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:20,580
there's a third component that's called

108
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:23,339
relying party software or sometimes also

109
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:27,389
validator after a very popular package

110
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:28,860
for this which sits somewhere and

111
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,529
collects all of these announcements

112
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,409
validates them absolutely checks which

113
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,249
ones are valid and produces a list of

114
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:39,808
things that are called

115
00:05:35,249 --> 00:05:42,539
VR piece validated robot payload and

116
00:05:39,809 --> 00:05:43,979
makes this list available 2d routers so

117
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,509
what happens here is that it's not the

118
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:47,669
routers themselves that do all of this

119
00:05:45,509 --> 00:05:49,469
gathering and validating but there's a

120
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:52,139
separate component because obviously

121
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:53,459
there's a bunch of crypto involved and

122
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:55,139
it needs to be able to talk to the

123
00:05:53,459 --> 00:05:56,669
entire internet which maybe you don't

124
00:05:55,139 --> 00:05:59,129
want to have other management interfaces

125
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,109
of your routers there's a standard

126
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,809
protocol to have the relying party

127
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:06,089
software talk to the router

128
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:08,039
it's called rpki RTR there's also

129
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:10,949
alternative ways different things

130
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,869
implement different things one of the

131
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:15,169
two projects that we are indeed working

132
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:17,519
on is such a relying party software

133
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:25,080
that's called resonator it's already

134
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:26,580
available an important point here is as

135
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,580
I said there is what we're currently

136
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:33,300
doing with our PGI is we only do origin

137
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,969
validation which means it only looks at

138
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,580
where a certain announcement started it

139
00:06:35,969 --> 00:06:41,369
isn't look at the other that's sort of

140
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:45,389
the path of the announcement which for

141
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:47,069
most of the route hijacks or yeah that

142
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,540
happened is already good enough because

143
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:52,330
most of them aren't actually

144
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,000
sort of adversary there just someone

145
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:57,159
making a mistake typing a wrong number

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,220
and also because the Internet by now

147
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,190
routing is so very well connected it's

148
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:06,750
also enough if you're if dip prefix is

149
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:09,780
actually just one hop away that said

150
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:11,460
path validation is also possible with

151
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,539
rpki

152
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,440
there's currently some work being done

153
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:18,820
there's two drafts that are in the cider

154
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,550
ops working group I believe they're

155
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,380
currently sort of being adopted in the

156
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,870
process being adopted so maybe we will

157
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:31,360
see some more concrete work there during

158
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:32,860
the course of this year now because

159
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,310
there are certificates because they are

160
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,570
CAS that's always pretty scary many

161
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,130
people don't really want to run their

162
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:43,960
own CA so in order to facilitate

163
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,210
adoption of our PTI the idea was created

164
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:50,260
to say level let's and providers as a

165
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:51,789
service for people too so that they

166
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,760
don't have to run their own one which

167
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:56,860
means that typically the resource issue

168
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,539
that is whoever gave your resources to

169
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,850
you who runs this as a service for you

170
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:02,710
which is kind of clever because they

171
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,180
control those resources anyway so they

172
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:05,890
could take away the resources from you

173
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:11,080
anyway so might as well just trust them

174
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:13,120
to also run your CA they're the opposite

175
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,719
where you run your own CA now it's

176
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,430
called delegated or PGI so younger on

177
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,500
your own certificate authority you take

178
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,830
care of publishing all of this stuff

179
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:27,400
actually do it all of yourself quick

180
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:29,740
look at hosted epic I I said the

181
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,000
resource issues do this so all all five

182
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:36,430
are ers have a service since 2011 you

183
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,870
basically what you do is you go into the

184
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,270
portal that they have you click around

185
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:46,360
and then you get your rules published

186
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:49,960
the concept differs between the five are

187
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,880
IRS so with Aaron you have to do peer

188
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:57,220
still have to do a deal with key pairs

189
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:59,220
and stuff for instance with the ripe

190
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,590
solution you really just go in there

191
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:05,950
click around to create your OS even how

192
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:08,140
so if this is indeed our own little

193
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:12,310
Network with the massive amount of two

194
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:15,580
prefixes and one ASL so you can create

195
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:17,410
your robots there it even helps you by

196
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,260
showing you the announcements that they

197
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:22,120
have seen so that you can be sure to

198
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:26,020
grate the correct rows it you will see

199
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:28,350
there it says alerts are sent to one

200
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:34,420
address so you also get alerts when

201
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:36,490
things go wrong stuff like that if you

202
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,719
run your own CA then of course you get

203
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:39,580
none of that you have to do it all

204
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,760
yourself you have to run and maintain

205
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,500
your software the way this works is that

206
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,990
basically you start your software and

207
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,730
then you talk to whoever gave you the D

208
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,460
resources and they create a certificate

209
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,050
for you there is a protocol for that so

210
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:55,420
it's not like you have to call them or

211
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:56,709
send faxes or something and there's a

212
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,329
standard protocol so you can actually

213
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,860
just off they can talk to their software

214
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,589
and do this all in an automated fashion

215
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,150
which means that stuff like renewing

216
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:07,030
certificates when they expire that can

217
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:08,770
help you automate it away so you create

218
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:12,520
you get your certificates you create

219
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:15,579
your own robots and you publish them now

220
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,400
the information where this publishing

221
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,020
happens that's all part of the

222
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,089
certificates itself so this all happens

223
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,740
magically you don't have to say publish

224
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:27,040
some things in the DNS or some other

225
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:30,100
thing it's just all part of that so

226
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,520
which one is then the right for the

227
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:35,230
right solution for you before we get

228
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:38,140
into that an important point to make is

229
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,620
that if you decide to publish for us

230
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:44,860
wouldn't of course you should then you

231
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,990
should go all in as I said if there's no

232
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,430
role for a certain prefix then that

233
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,230
doesn't matter there's just no filters

234
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,609
and everything works fine but if you

235
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,790
start publishing growers and they're

236
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,610
wrong then your your prefixes may not be

237
00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,550
available anymore so an important point

238
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:02,290
is that once you started creating rows

239
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,599
you have to maintain them if you change

240
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,540
your topology if you change your your

241
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,630
routes make sure to remember to update

242
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:13,000
your rows which means basically however

243
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,709
you however your procedures are rpki

244
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,860
when the rowers need to be an important

245
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:18,109
part of that

246
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,930
as with anything that you do you should

247
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:23,900
have monitoring and alerting and lastly

248
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:25,910
your help test needs to be prepared to

249
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,640
deal with things coming out of roses is

250
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:31,130
probably more important if you are

251
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,680
filtering routes based on our peculiar

252
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,330
information then you're helped your

253
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,239
first lime stuff needs to be aware of

254
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:40,150
dit and they need to be aware that a

255
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,440
certain prefix may it may be unavailable

256
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:45,910
because if broke and robust they need to

257
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:50,050
be able to check those and should have

258
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:53,810
know how to deal with with the situation

259
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:55,729
if you don't then bad things can happen

260
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:57,890
or this is an example not to call anyone

261
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:59,600
out but I mean it's a good example to

262
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:02,660
show that this also happens to big guys

263
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,180
not just to the little guys in November

264
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,339
orange moved from slash sixteens to more

265
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,890
specific slash 17s forgot to update

266
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,560
their robots and big chunks became

267
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,300
unavailable back then this wasn't such a

268
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,430
big deal because there hasn't been so

269
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:19,310
much filtering happening just yet but

270
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:20,920
with every sort of month we get

271
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:24,140
announcements of more people who do

272
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:27,069
filtering based on rpki so this becomes

273
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,069
more of a more of an issue

274
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,300
so maybe hosted rpki really is the

275
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,950
better solution you do not have to

276
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,449
install anything you do not have to have

277
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,270
some dedicated heart but you don't have

278
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:42,980
to deal with keys also you don't have to

279
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:44,959
deal with publication you can just start

280
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,160
with this so you can just go into the

281
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:52,459
portal of your of your rir and create

282
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:55,160
rowers and start getting an experience

283
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:59,270
with this deal with with with the new

284
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:03,079
technology why would you then want to

285
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:05,209
actually run your own CA one point is or

286
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,980
normally it comes down to if you have

287
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:09,560
lots of resources of course clicking

288
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,860
around in the web interface gets tedious

289
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,400
very quickly particularly if you are

290
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:18,110
under multiple our IRS then you have to

291
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,279
go and do all of these interfaces they

292
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,440
all behave differently you have to

293
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,350
remember how they work that becomes

294
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,180
tedious relatively quickly whereas if

295
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:28,060
you run your own thing you can integrate

296
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,979
it directly into the way

297
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,920
provision you're out and you provision

298
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,560
your infrastructure so it can be

299
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:38,579
basically an integrated part of the way

300
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:43,869
you do your your organization your

301
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:45,190
resources you will also of course be in

302
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:48,280
possession of your private keys

303
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,920
if that isn't that is important for some

304
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:55,050
people and you are operationally

305
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:55,050
independent from the area or itself

306
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,830
which now let's look into indeed let's

307
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:06,220
say you have decided to run your own RPI

308
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:08,080
what is the hardware at the software and

309
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,520
the services around is that you need to

310
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,650
take care of well let's start with the

311
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,439
software and it already gets a little

312
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:18,280
difficult there we're only aware of two

313
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:22,060
projects to have CI software one is a

314
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:26,140
PRI our PID by dragon research that's

315
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,719
basically the original CI software it's

316
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:33,480
a Python based solution I have been told

317
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,670
it's not the easiest thing to install so

318
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:39,310
yeah there's that and then there's a new

319
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:41,199
project called krill which is ours and

320
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,300
that's even harder to install because it

321
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,440
doesn't exist yet we're currently

322
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,949
working on it

323
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,830
we're hoping to have something available

324
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:56,380
later this year with the complete

325
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:58,330
solution late 2019 so that's already

326
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,410
slightly tricky if you want to do this

327
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,570
right now

328
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:03,730
what's the hardware and connectivity you

329
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,140
need for the certificate authority you

330
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:07,210
don't really need that much even if you

331
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,890
have relatively many resources and even

332
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,710
if they change relatively often there's

333
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:15,310
not that much that's going on so you

334
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:16,930
don't need something big from a

335
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,300
technical perspective you also don't

336
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,680
need an HSM I'm just having the keys on

337
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,990
a machine that is reasonably well

338
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,670
secured should be fine of course your

339
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:29,770
legal counsel might be of a different

340
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:31,120
opinion there the more important and the

341
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,939
more challenging thing is the

342
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,190
publication server because it is of

343
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,040
course internet facing that means it has

344
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:40,280
all the consequences that means people

345
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,060
will

346
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:47,120
want to mess with it so there is an

347
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,349
option here to instead of running it

348
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,630
yourself and dealing what out of it

349
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,670
yourself you can outsource it which is

350
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:55,340
what we call the hybrid option so you

351
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,709
run your own CA and you leave the

352
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,490
difficult part of the publication to

353
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:05,120
someone else we have spoken to at least

354
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,670
one cloud provider who offered to once

355
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,070
this is actually available and easily

356
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,930
doable we'll offer this as a free

357
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,000
service as a sort of a good of the

358
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,870
internet kind of service to the

359
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,010
community you could even go any further

360
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:23,930
and have a RI are independent hosted CA

361
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,510
so right now all of these hosted things

362
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,699
are run by the IRS there could be also

363
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:32,000
someone who does this for you it's an

364
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:35,450
RPG is a service thing might want to

365
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,880
look into why is publication a bit

366
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:41,540
difficult right now it uses our sink

367
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:45,200
which I think not many people have

368
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:48,620
operational experience with so you'd

369
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,990
have to run an arcing server which given

370
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,460
that our PK is getting bigger or the

371
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,280
repository is getting bigger very

372
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:57,080
quickly you would have to deal with a

373
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,780
bit of traffic there there is an

374
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:03,320
alternative our RDP which is an HTTP

375
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:05,869
based protocol which will make it easier

376
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,980
to do what you normally do with HTTP

377
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:12,859
which is you just throw it at a CDN our

378
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,890
NTP is currently deployed in ripe NCC

379
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:18,740
and APNIC so they are actually using RDP

380
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,710
for publication Erin said they might

381
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,480
look into doing that this year

382
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:25,250
but even independently from the our IRS

383
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,410
if you do your own thing you can still

384
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:32,480
also opt for publishing via our RDP

385
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,050
unfortunately at this point arson

386
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,890
against mandatory so you will have to do

387
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:42,980
our sink anyway final note and I think a

388
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,870
set is already the uptime here is in the

389
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:46,970
publication server so if you have a

390
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,909
relatively stable Network you absolutely

391
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,740
could do run your CA in a bunker

392
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,950
somewhere with that never seeing the

393
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,970
light of day

394
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:02,480
so should you choose your delegated rpki

395
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:05,350
well as I said the answer is maybe

396
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,450
is it more secure than running a hosted

397
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:11,659
solution well not really especially if

398
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,400
you use for the AR AR based or if you go

399
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:15,620
for the AR AR based hosted solution

400
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,169
because they are in control of your

401
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,178
resources anyway they are in control of

402
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:22,160
the certificate that you have to have to

403
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:23,150
run your own so if they want to mess

404
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,330
with you they can take away your

405
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,620
certificate and that's that is it more

406
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:33,970
convenient well it sort of boils down to

407
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:36,889
its the pain of running your own thing

408
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:39,710
less or more than having to deal with

409
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:45,919
these web interfaces imagine to do that

410
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:48,049
at 3m under stress so basically it comes

411
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,090
down to how many prefixes do you have

412
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:57,470
how sort of volatile is your network

413
00:18:50,090 --> 00:19:00,320
often do things change final note what

414
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:03,169
happens if my solution breaks but the

415
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,110
good news is that this isn't DNS ACK so

416
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:08,330
if you mess up your signing it doesn't

417
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,990
mean that suddenly your whole zone or

418
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,649
your whole network becomes unavailable

419
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:15,470
basically rpki

420
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:19,580
is a positive statement if it's not

421
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:21,770
there nobody cares which means if you

422
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:25,340
lose your keys if your hardware goes

423
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:27,200
down if you are under a DDoS attack then

424
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,020
what will basically happen is that

425
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,179
eventually euros will expire and will go

426
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,410
away and you're just back at where you

427
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,660
were before you were publishing them

428
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,460
which also means that say you lose your

429
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,520
keys basically just revoke your

430
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,830
certificate with the whoever issued it

431
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,860
and you go to your back at I don't have

432
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:48,230
anything state a problem of course is

433
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,620
especially if you're under DDoS you

434
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:55,970
cannot update your your robust anymore

435
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:59,989
so that might be an issue there that

436
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:03,620
should be considered finally if we

437
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:05,159
convinced you to look into our PGI and

438
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,820
your own

439
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:11,140
CA or we have some reading collected

440
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,000
specifically there is our a peacock you

441
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,529
mentation project which is under this

442
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,320
URI for now it's an open source thing so

443
00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:23,320
if you have some contributions there to

444
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:25,629
make then you're very welcome especially

445
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,340
we want to make not make this one that

446
00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,590
is only covering our own products so

447
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:31,299
Crillon Raja Nader so we very much

448
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,689
welcome input from everyone who does

449
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:37,840
rpki related software to contribute

450
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:41,409
contribution to this to this project as

451
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,090
well and finally if you want to talk to

452
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:46,510
us about our pika here's where you can

453
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:49,480
find us we have a website surprisingly

454
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:51,700
enough there is an email address or PGI

455
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,690
team and our labs and we are of course

456
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:57,760
also on the Twitter we also which we

457
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,820
forgot to put here there is a rpki at

458
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,490
another labs mailing list which is very

459
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,049
much focused on our own stuff right now

460
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:06,190
but we also think that maybe if there's

461
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:08,440
more people hanging out I think there's

462
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,269
already quite a few and knowledge of

463
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,630
people nd knowledgeable people in the

464
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:15,039
RPI Reaume subscribe to this so if you

465
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:19,750
need some help I think that might be a

466
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:24,210
good a good place to ask thank you very

467
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,210
much and that open to questions

468
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:34,480
[Applause]

469
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:37,090
mad PTAC no we're at the moment thank

470
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,130
you if Martin great talk one thing you

471
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:43,720
said on an earlier slide is it's better

472
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:45,490
to have no Rose than bad rose as part of

473
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,590
the the software package you're putting

474
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:49,630
together by any chance is there going to

475
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,330
be something that will validate Warren

476
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,430
or otherwise tell people hey you're

477
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,780
doing something bad don't publish this

478
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:57,040
you're going to shoot yourself from the

479
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,899
foot because one of the things that I

480
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,120
hear right now is there's a lot of

481
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,360
holding back from our ki KI because the

482
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,820
potential for unintentionally causing

483
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,459
yourself grief is so high that it's

484
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,750
actually safer did you say you know what

485
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,210
what's working today is working I don't

486
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:15,430
want to mess with it that's absolutely

487
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,130
someone something that we have in mind

488
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:19,840
as you saw on the on the ripe thing they

489
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:22,900
do this already so they have a list of

490
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,030
your announcements and help you design

491
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:27,180
decide on correct reverse that's

492
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:32,230
absolutely something we want to do too

493
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:33,880
we're also looking into providing some

494
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,140
sort of global monitoring thing we

495
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,220
haven't decided on that yet of course

496
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,810
that's a lot of work and a lot of

497
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,850
resources that bind so we need to see

498
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,230
how we are we can make this possible but

499
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,959
it is absolutely something that we

500
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:45,490
realize is very important and that's

501
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:51,430
also very important for the community at

502
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:57,280
large awesome thank you oh you're

503
00:22:51,430 --> 00:23:01,870
photogenic oh okay I stay out for a

504
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,760
change out of the wise guys so I'm not

505
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:10,020
asking questions where I know the

506
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:14,230
answers yesterday at the rpki

507
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:17,440
operational Roundtable someone brought

508
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:20,680
up the observation that the user

509
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,680
interfaces for we hosted services seem

510
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:29,110
to be fairly different across all of the

511
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:31,690
existing CAS what I don't know I I have

512
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:36,540
been running for out of my lab for

513
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:40,850
something like ten years my tests see a

514
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:46,490
but just with one upstream CA

515
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:52,100
and actually that already proved to be a

516
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:55,970
challenge once in a while have you

517
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:58,539
looked into how the interfaces the

518
00:23:55,970 --> 00:24:02,450
operational interfaces for connecting

519
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:05,539
your dedicated CA to the various

520
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:09,080
potential up streams are they all the

521
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:11,179
same or is there also a challenge so

522
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,070
there is a standard protocol there's

523
00:24:11,179 --> 00:24:17,539
some RFC's on that matter and we haven't

524
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,700
we don't have any operational experience

525
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,740
with that just yet but we will

526
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,379
definitely we are in contact with the AR

527
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:27,259
AR s at least they are very much

528
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:29,449
interested in what we're doing and that

529
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:31,309
will definitely be part of once we get

530
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,110
to that point it's still very early days

531
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:36,110
for us we just get to see am working at

532
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,969
all and then we're gonna see how how we

533
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,279
integrate is with whatever else is out

534
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,870
there and we have plans to do interrupt

535
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:46,879
testing with everything else that's out

536
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:50,059
there yes we are aware that one of the

537
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:51,830
use cases for running your own CA is

538
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:54,289
indeed if you have multiple up streams

539
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:56,870
and need to deal with that so also

540
00:24:54,289 --> 00:24:59,600
things where the system can decide

541
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:01,070
itself what needs to go on which um so

542
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,649
instead of just saying if this robot

543
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:06,110
there it just knows what your resources

544
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:08,629
are or what your delegated resources are

545
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,949
and then figures out stuff that's all

546
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:11,149
ideas that we have that's all very

547
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,730
important for us because we know that

548
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:15,649
that's the use case that people have for

549
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,120
this whole system so that's definitely

550
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:24,799
something that we're gonna have to make

551
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:29,120
work just doing follow-up yes I'm aware

552
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:32,389
there is a protocol at standard one but

553
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:35,658
there seems to be something I don't

554
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:39,379
recall the exact term a business

555
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:43,070
protocol that has to be used and that

556
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:48,799
seems to be specific to the various CAS

557
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:51,049
or say better say our IRS yes but I

558
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,990
think you only do that once when you set

559
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,470
up your thing

560
00:25:51,990 --> 00:26:01,140
I represent sure I can't quite unser -

561
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:02,320
just yet thank you all right thank you

562
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:05,540
very much

563
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,540
[Applause]

564
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,860
you
