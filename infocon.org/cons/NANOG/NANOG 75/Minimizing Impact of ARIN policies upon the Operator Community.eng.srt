1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,649
- good morning everybody how are you all

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:17,200
doing

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,850
Patrick you have to leave so soon all

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,759
because I'm up here thanks so much

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:26,650
all right so life story here I'm the guy

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,020
from Alaska it's probably a lot of you

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:31,000
already know I can't say that actually

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,460
this time Daniel are you in here

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,220
somewhere damn Kirschbaum is a another

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,860
fellow from Alaska so if you run into

11
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:44,470
him or you see him say hi represent

12
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:47,470
Alaska I've been in Alaska 49 years I've

13
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,260
been working for my company General GCI

14
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:52,269
Communications for about 25 right now

15
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,309
doing security architecture I spent 20

16
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,190
years doing network architecture about

17
00:00:54,310 --> 00:01:01,210
five years ago I was elected to the

18
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:02,830
Aaron Advisory Council and last year our

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,619
chair Tina Morris brought me on as the

20
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:07,390
vice chair I'm not sure why but I

21
00:01:05,619 --> 00:01:08,920
apparently it's because I can get up in

22
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:12,280
front of people and speak and not look

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,810
entirely nervous so that's great I know

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,930
all of you are really interested in

25
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:18,700
policy right how many of you are

26
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:20,469
actually operators I just want to kind

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,020
of get a show of hands like three four

28
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:26,048
or five operators out there perfect so

29
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,359
this is entirely for you and it's

30
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:31,270
because there's a lot of change in

31
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:33,908
Aaron's focus these days right ipv4 is

32
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,890
running out there's a market for it but

33
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:39,249
you can't just go to the well and pull

34
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:40,840
some up with your buckets and so we've

35
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:43,509
got an interesting change in our

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,999
incoming policy queue right and it's

37
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:47,530
gonna wane over time but currently right

38
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:49,929
now it's being used to address the

39
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:52,270
shortcomings in this pure transfer

40
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:55,149
market and hopefully to address some

41
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:57,009
database cleanup now one of the things

42
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:59,200
that has happened as a result of this is

43
00:01:57,009 --> 00:02:02,049
that the Board of Trustees has recently

44
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,179
remanded a couple of policies back due

45
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,189
to some fraud cases that have shown up

46
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:09,190
or because they're very difficult to

47
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:11,640
implement these policies based on the

48
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:15,310
impact to you the operator community

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,319
right and just for a little break here a

50
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:20,790
little bit about Alaska life you can see

51
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,790
that we have fun on our Beach

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,620
and it says 49 below Fahrenheit but I

53
00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:29,909
don't that's about the same in Celsius

54
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,709
too right and I think this is what it

55
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:35,519
looks like right now it's been snowing

56
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:38,190
for a few days but just a reminder what

57
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,810
this talk isn't about I'm not going to

58
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,870
go into policy texts I'm not going to

59
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:45,239
try to explain or sway you over with

60
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,060
what the language in specific policies

61
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,920
is but I do want to know if you are okay

62
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,470
with what's happening with the changes

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,690
in the policy and if you are unduly

64
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,609
impacted right there's a lot of work

65
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,060
that has to happen on the operator side

66
00:02:56,609 --> 00:03:02,340
back end and to adapt to these policy

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,220
changes and I want to remind you that

68
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,470
you're out there as operators and even

69
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:12,209
if you don't go to Erin you can still

70
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:17,250
participate and if you participate we

71
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:22,700
can all make policies fun again again

72
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:25,590
alright they were fun before I'm sure so

73
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,849
right here our quick agenda I'm just

74
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:29,459
going to summarize what's happening on

75
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:32,099
the current docket and what some of the

76
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:33,870
impacts are to you and then in the

77
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,910
second half of it we'll go over some of

78
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,470
the database cleanup who is and how

79
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,590
that's impacting law enforcement and

80
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,910
other abuse monitoring and what we can

81
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:48,269
do to get some of that data cleaned up

82
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:50,609
so I mean why why am I here because we

83
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:54,150
are impacting the operator community and

84
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:56,340
the changes that are coming through Erin

85
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,500
policy being driven by other operators

86
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,510
that are participating are impacting the

87
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:05,280
rest of the operator community we've got

88
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,959
a lot of validation and who is data

89
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,760
accuracy you've heard law enforcement

90
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,639
talk about that probably yesterday in

91
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,590
the afternoon sessions a lot of the

92
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,440
automated tooling that you have in place

93
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,959
today to deal with records new records

94
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,180
being submitted and it's gonna break and

95
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,669
that's always a painful thing when your

96
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:28,370
developers have moved on so one of the

97
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:30,930
first policies I'll talk about here is

98
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:33,240
one that's already been adopted by the

99
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:35,009
board it happened last year and this is

100
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,979
something you're probably already

101
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:39,419
doing today which is validating your

102
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,318
point of contact emails for your

103
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,479
organization's

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,669
and right now you're probably clicking

105
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,469
on that button once a year yeah when

106
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,089
they come in or did you automate do you

107
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:50,069
have an automated process you're sending

108
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:52,529
that through the mailman or some mail

109
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:55,379
filter and having it manually click that

110
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:57,389
button that's something that if you're

111
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,830
not doing absolutely you should be doing

112
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:00,569
that it makes things easier

113
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,729
you can log it you can send it back get

114
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:05,580
reports on how often it's changing or if

115
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,409
it's failing especially if you're

116
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:10,740
managing contacts for other businesses

117
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:15,688
this is something that's happening a lot

118
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,969
more these days but as things progressed

119
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,740
we get API changes error logging linkage

120
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,960
breaks so it's absolutely something you

121
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:26,370
need to keep an eye out for if you start

122
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,529
doing this automation the next one here

123
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,809
when we removed reallocation

124
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:33,599
requirements for residential market

125
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:34,889
assignments this is really all about you

126
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:37,080
got a small business on the other end of

127
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,669
a cable modem and a lot of people were

128
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,839
sending in detailed reassignment

129
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:44,370
requests and as happens people just type

130
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,919
in whatever information they want and

131
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:49,080
it's never accurate and so some of that

132
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,990
update was breaking and we want to make

133
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,430
sure that people understand that they

134
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,269
don't have to do that for these smaller

135
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:59,789
assignments that's get rid of that in

136
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:05,459
your tooling and we don't have an influx

137
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:10,128
of incorrect information as the old

138
00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:12,800
adage goes simplify simplify simplify oh

139
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:16,229
man 27:12

140
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,539
2017 - well okay so this is one that was

141
00:06:16,229 --> 00:06:22,080
remanded back to the aran advisory

142
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,959
council because of the impact specific

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,169
aim back to the operator community this

144
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,269
is a big workflow change for you when we

145
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,580
start talking about how we validate the

146
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:36,180
points of contact before they go into

147
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,649
the database a lot of your tooling the

148
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:40,259
feedback that we got was a lot of

149
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,930
automated tooling expected a quick

150
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,849
turnaround you submitted your requests

151
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,020
into the database and you expected it to

152
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:49,289
just work and to be there

153
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,049
this now requires that validation to

154
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,790
happen and if you have a manual process

155
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,060
where if somebody has to go and click

156
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,590
that button in the email that's going to

157
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,690
break that chain of events and if you

158
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:03,780
can't do records insertions until your

159
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,480
records are validated now the rest of

160
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,710
your chain of events is going to break

161
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:11,040
and we've had a lot of rewrites happen

162
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,930
recently ppm L the public policy mailing

163
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,780
lists who was just sent out some of

164
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:17,550
those rewrites it's gonna be refocusing

165
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,700
on the detailed reassignments from

166
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,560
points of contacts and org creations and

167
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,570
requiring a pre-existing organization

168
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,610
with at least one valid point of contact

169
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,969
before you can do your detail Dre

170
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,110
assignments of course there's an

171
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,560
alternative out there that a lot of

172
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,000
people don't know or is the simple

173
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,680
reassignments and you should really be

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,350
using simple reassignments now for your

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,690
customers as much as possible it's just

176
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:44,670
going to simplify your workflows and

177
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,740
help with a lot of the database cleanup

178
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,420
you have a lot of sales people coming in

179
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,700
and just quickly typing in information

180
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,440
maybe not validating everything so move

181
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,260
that forward if you have any other

182
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,300
questions on this particular policy our

183
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,820
Sheppard's are Christian tacit and David

184
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:03,210
farmer so you can look on the P P ml for

185
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:07,340
those two names and send them some

186
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:07,340
questions if you have them directly so

187
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:16,530
xx 18-5 also about organizational record

188
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,330
creation this one is restricting that

189
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,130
creation to the primary business entity

190
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,539
so you don't have third parties coming

191
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,570
in and trying to create new

192
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,370
organizational records again this is

193
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,599
going to break your automated tooling

194
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,720
that expects to be able to immediately

195
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,220
create those or godis and again using

196
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,370
simple reassignments will help alleviate

197
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,590
the pains in your automation Andrew dull

198
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,140
and Owen DeLong are the Shepherds from

199
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:47,130
this policy and you can find them again

200
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:48,480
on the ppm L so for twenty 18-6 we're

201
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,790
looking to clarify some of these

202
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,400
reassignment requirements again bringing

203
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,020
back that simple reassignments message

204
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,390
to minimize the work for your pokémon

205
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,889
tynin s-- and only the customer name is

206
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,600
needed right the eyes the ISP

207
00:08:59,889 --> 00:09:05,290
the operators you already have all the

208
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,699
information internally but you only need

209
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:08,709
to specify that customer name when

210
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:10,508
you're doing that simple reassignment up

211
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,758
into Aran so that helps clean up the

212
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:15,790
database keeps a lot of that unnecessary

213
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:17,470
data out it does push the responsibility

214
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,269
of ownership tracking back to you the

215
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,269
organization for law enforcement

216
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:25,959
requests but you're probably already

217
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:27,609
getting those anyway ELISA Moore and

218
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:32,108
Alison wood are the primary and

219
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:34,029
secondary Sheppard's for that policy and

220
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:36,730
of course the big one in the room the

221
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:39,069
elephant is the ipv4 waiting list a lot

222
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,809
of people out there are trying to get on

223
00:09:39,069 --> 00:09:43,118
this waiting list in hopes of getting

224
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:46,779
some of those small scraps of ipv4 space

225
00:09:43,119 --> 00:09:49,179
returned to Aaron by either Ayane or the

226
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:50,439
other organizations that decide that

227
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:52,269
they just want to return it for the

228
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:56,410
betterment as opposed to putting those

229
00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:58,839
addresses up on the free pool so this is

230
00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:01,868
all part of number resource policy

231
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,759
manual section 4-1 8 which describes the

232
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:06,009
wait list policy and at least six

233
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,619
different problem areas have been

234
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:12,549
identified here and that's a lot of

235
00:10:08,619 --> 00:10:15,129
problem areas for this we've got a lot

236
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:18,100
of proposals that are in the queue and

237
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:21,399
we are attempting to address all of

238
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:24,249
these problem areas while minimizing the

239
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:26,259
impact on the operator community it's

240
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:30,699
very challenging it's been very time

241
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:32,799
consuming but we've got a good handle on

242
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:35,319
where we think this needs to go and

243
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:38,110
we're continuing to work on a basic

244
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:40,209
selection menu of two to three options

245
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,869
which we think best represents the ideal

246
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:49,169
state which gives the operator community

247
00:10:43,869 --> 00:10:51,160
the best bang for their buck and you

248
00:10:49,169 --> 00:10:55,329
should be seeing some more information

249
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:58,719
on that coming up in April at the next

250
00:10:55,329 --> 00:11:00,128
Arin meeting so some of the questions

251
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,809
that we're looking for

252
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:04,689
these are just sample questions I'm not

253
00:11:01,809 --> 00:11:07,480
going to read them that the operator

254
00:11:04,689 --> 00:11:09,309
community can think about as you're

255
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,549
going through all of these policies on

256
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:13,510
your own time and really enjoying the

257
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:16,780
fun that policy

258
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,790
making is how is this really impacting

259
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,610
your business and what can we do as

260
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:25,900
policy writers to ease that burden on

261
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:28,630
you and then again how do you expect

262
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,699
Aaron to come back within your

263
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,770
development cycle in terms of

264
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,690
implementing these policies you need us

265
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:37,240
to wait for a longer period of time so

266
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:39,190
that you can deal with spinning up a

267
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,810
development cycle and validating

268
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:42,600
everything or is this something that you

269
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:49,599
can turn around quickly because you have

270
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:51,910
very good in-house developers so those

271
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,950
that that's really the big stuff there

272
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,170
for the Aaron policies and there's a few

273
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,030
ways that you can provide feedback we've

274
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,380
got the upcoming meeting in Barbados in

275
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,510
case you need a change from this cold

276
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,630
weather here in San Francisco or on the

277
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:07,240
East Coast apparently that's April 7th

278
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,760
through 10th in Barbados we're gonna m'm

279
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:13,960
everybody to show up we've got these

280
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,420
policy consultations at Nanog or just

281
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:20,440
these presentations so the next big one

282
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:23,020
will be in October Aaron will be there

283
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,090
if you can't make June where we'll

284
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:28,000
probably have another presentation quite

285
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:29,940
like this but hopefully with some more

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,740
information about the newer policies

287
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,360
come at least be showing up to Austin

288
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,870
and give us some feedback at the

289
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,400
microphone get on to ppm l if you're an

290
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,170
operator you should be there you should

291
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,510
be keeping an eye on the policies that

292
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:45,430
are coming out and how they're impacting

293
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:47,590
you and of course you can always view

294
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,410
the policies online at the URL that's

295
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:52,690
provided and I've given you the names of

296
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:59,650
the Shepherd's but also you'll find

297
00:12:52,690 --> 00:13:01,240
those online on the policies so part two

298
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:03,939
here is all about the database cleanup

299
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,450
how that impacts you who is points of

300
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,650
contacts everybody understands the

301
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:11,470
importance of who is it's used

302
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:14,579
everywhere right it's used for anti-spam

303
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,620
geolocation there law enforcement and

304
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,510
the network history who was right when

305
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,090
for the ipv4 market people want to see

306
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,590
the history of networks and in the

307
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,190
various regions before they go and

308
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,190
purchase them

309
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:33,389
there we go so I've got some statistics

310
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:34,949
that were presented a few years ago two

311
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,089
three two years ago now two and a half

312
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:39,118
an analogue 70

313
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:40,740
I can't divide by three Leslie no Beale

314
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:42,839
I know you're in the audience here you

315
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,529
know she's in the back waving she does a

316
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:51,990
great presentation on the database

317
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:53,550
statistics and cleanup and recently gave

318
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,910
me some new information so we have a

319
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:57,628
total almost a million points of context

320
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,050
in the database

321
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:06,660
right and only 234 a quarter of them are

322
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:08,910
validated that's not a lot and of the

323
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:13,050
unvalidated ones when you're talking 60

324
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:15,269
percent non validated non orphaned

325
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:19,079
points of contact that's a lot of

326
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:23,069
cleanup work that has to be done so how

327
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:25,079
do we get there right right now it

328
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:27,920
starts with that email request you click

329
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:31,709
that validate link or you can go online

330
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,209
you can reply to the email and some of

331
00:14:31,709 --> 00:14:35,399
those methods can be automated as I was

332
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:36,989
discussing earlier and then you've got a

333
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:39,589
nice audit trail for all of that that's

334
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,569
happening but the automation

335
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:45,540
unfortunately does not solve the

336
00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:50,160
incorrect information there's a lot of

337
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:52,740
bad data in who is be that I don't want

338
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,449
to say maybe I should say lazy operators

339
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,889
no I'm not pointing any fingers and my

340
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:58,800
company's probably just one of the bad

341
00:14:55,889 --> 00:15:01,970
ones as well who don't go in all the

342
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,550
time to validate and clean up their data

343
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,929
orphaned records and the blackops

344
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:16,910
transfers I don't know about any of

345
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:19,769
those but what can we do about it stop

346
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:23,429
stop what we're doing we got to stop the

347
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:24,959
status quo stop your pets rating the bad

348
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:27,119
data we have to fix our automated

349
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,329
tooling we have to incentivize our

350
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:34,410
employees and our co-workers to fix that

351
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:37,469
bad data early fix it often use simple

352
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,370
reassignments now where we can I know

353
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,770
it's not fun it's not

354
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,720
flashy doesn't pay us the big bucks but

355
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:49,740
it will decrease the workload down the

356
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:51,180
road and that's basically it so this as

357
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:54,750
a reminder come to the meetings

358
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,510
participate on ppm l give us feedback

359
00:15:54,750 --> 00:16:00,480
where you think it's going to impact you

360
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,720
and that helps us rewrite the policy so

361
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,460
that it's not as burdensome upon you

362
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:13,870
join the mailing lists stay up to date

363
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:19,019
and this is a reminder so thank you

364
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,019
[Applause]

365
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,260
you
