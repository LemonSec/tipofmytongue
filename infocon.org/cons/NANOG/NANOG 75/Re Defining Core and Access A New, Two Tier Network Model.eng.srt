1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,750
now for something completely different

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,539
all right yes so I am Chris Grundmann

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,279
and like many of you I spend most of my

4
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:20,160
time helping companies build network

5
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,300
infrastructure but first of all actually

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,490
I'd like to thank you all for being here

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,050
like right after lunch on Wednesday the

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,250
third day of Nanog so I just really

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,710
appreciate everyone showing up and being

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,960
here and being awake it's pretty awesome

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,420
quick show of hands who went to the

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,489
Exploratorium last night awesome yeah

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,260
that was fun and I had a lot of fun

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,879
there playing with a bunch of the models

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,670
that were kind of demonstrating how

16
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,890
different aspects of the physical world

17
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,539
work and that's interesting because when

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:47,820
we talk about is a model for

19
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,460
understanding how networks work I think

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,579
this is probably nothing super new in

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,019
here in this talk but hopefully combined

22
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,879
in an interesting way that might help

23
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:59,690
the way you think about building

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,210
networks now and into the future

25
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,309
so we are a little behind schedule and I

26
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,280
do have about 68 slides so buckle up

27
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,000
we're gonna be here for a while we're

28
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,880
gonna jump in though

29
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,900
so network model so first I think we

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,190
should probably set the stage by

31
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,100
understanding of what would I even mean

32
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,780
by a network model right so I think we

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,789
know what a network is we need to pass

34
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,680
packets with Deford frames

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,510
there's routers and switches all of your

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,040
favorite middle boxin they kind of

37
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:27,840
populate in between the regions and

38
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,790
routers and obviously the connections

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,470
that tie them together so hopefully in

40
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,980
an OGG were pretty solid on what a

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,230
network is what's a model right I'm not

42
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,720
talking about an H oh scale trainset

43
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,790
obviously we've I don't want a 3d print

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,740
a physical representation of your

45
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:44,640
network that's plain not super useful so

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,619
what I really want to talk about is a

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,480
conceptual model all right but but what

48
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,240
does that mean wikipedia says that a

49
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:54,150
conceptual model is a set of concepts

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,530
not a very handy definition and

51
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,550
abstraction of real things I think

52
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,450
that's a little bit more interesting

53
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,550
we're starting to get to where we want

54
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,070
to talk about a representation of a

55
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,070
system just getting a little warmer

56
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,360
really what we want to talk about is a

57
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:08,098
something that we you're using to help

58
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,568
people know understand or simulate a

59
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:11,099
subject right so just a way of thinking

60
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:14,250
about something it is really what a

61
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,349
model is in this context anyway so

62
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:18,359
Before we jump into what I'd like to

63
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:19,329
introduce as the new model is I would

64
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:20,650
call it

65
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,720
- first kind of look at the old model

66
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,610
obviously there's there's a number of

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,190
different network architectures out

68
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:28,870
there but I think the most commonly used

69
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,700
in especially like enterprise and

70
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,800
campuses and data centers is this

71
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,980
three-tier hierarchical Network model

72
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,890
right so you've got your core big

73
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,239
switches passing packets the aggregation

74
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:42,910
layer where your kind of services live

75
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:45,340
in the access layer down below to kind

76
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,930
of get those ports out what's

77
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,270
interesting is you know the data center

78
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,640
network model looks suspiciously similar

79
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,050
but we've changed one word the

80
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,489
distribution instead of aggregation

81
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,840
which is kind of curious obviously I

82
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,340
wasn't there when they made those naming

83
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,080
choice I don't really know why that

84
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,940
choice was made but I have a suspicion

85
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,010
that has something to do with this

86
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,740
client-server model where we're really

87
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:07,780
doing is aggregating you know client

88
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,100
connections sending them across the

89
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,480
network and then distributing them out

90
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,209
to the servers luckily there's a return

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,140
path there as well and this was where

92
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,670
you know not only is there that

93
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,679
three-tier model of core distribution

94
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,500
and access but there's this other three

95
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,520
which is LAN LAN and data center and I

96
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,900
think one of the reasons we tend to

97
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,650
split these networks apart and there's a

98
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,269
couple of reasons right physical

99
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,280
boundaries and things like that but one

100
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:28,750
of the reasons is just complexity right

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,100
and so you're kind of you're limiting

102
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,450
your failure domain but also just kind

103
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,280
of your cognitive domain of what you

104
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,268
have to understand and you give a piece

105
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,230
of the network and you kind of build

106
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,550
them differently on things like that and

107
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,450
really you know this applies sideways

108
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,290
actually we're talking about as this

109
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,859
actually looks like a kind of a

110
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,090
north-south client-server model which is

111
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,080
starting to hint towards what we're

112
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,019
talking about but I don't get too far

113
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,880
ahead of myself here so again those

114
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,470
three tiers right that core layer which

115
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,940
is you know usually big iron just

116
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,320
passing packets really fast forward you

117
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,640
miss kind of the point there I can you

118
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,590
seen a distribution this is where I

119
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,850
would say network services live here all

120
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,739
right they live on these boxes that's

121
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,410
where your put you're dealing with

122
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,690
policy or you've kind of firewall rules

123
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,010
load balancing doing routing that kinda

124
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,970
stuff is all at that layer and then the

125
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,670
access obviously is just about

126
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:16,029
connectivity into that okay that's the

127
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:17,260
old model obviously I can't talk about

128
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,450
you know kind of the old three-tier

129
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,399
model without mentioning lead spine or

130
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,849
the folded closet network though kind of

131
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:26,409
we're talking about more today so what I

132
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,450
think happened is virtualization right

133
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,919
also like object-oriented programming

134
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,620
and micro services and things basically

135
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,960
we change traffic patterns

136
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,610
centers from purely north-south to

137
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,810
mostly east-west

138
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,729
also we're turning up and turning down

139
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,960
services really correctly so things have

140
00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:41,669
to adjust much faster

141
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,169
there's mobile workloads right you can

142
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:44,849
kind of move virtual machines around

143
00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:46,169
that kind of stuff and massive scale now

144
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:48,270
all these things aren't necessarily tied

145
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,979
to each other but they all did happen

146
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:51,930
about the same time and I think those

147
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,849
are the main forces that kind of spurred

148
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,560
this idea of at least mine network

149
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:00,389
coming into favor clauses not an acronym

150
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,750
is a guy named Charles Claus back in

151
00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:06,930
1952 figured out a way to hook together

152
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,360
crossbar switches to cost effectively

153
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,760
implement an almost infinite scaled

154
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,250
network that's what kind of allowed

155
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,050
telephony to to flourish pretty cool

156
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,130
there's some cool algorithms you can use

157
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,690
to figure out you know what the actual

158
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:21,150
capacity isn't and the number of links

159
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,639
and stuff I know what we're doing now

160
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:26,479
today is it's folding that up so we

161
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,650
can't give this leaf spine Network model

162
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,240
[Music]

163
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,650
spoiler alert that's not the two tiers

164
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,310
that that I want to talk about today

165
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,419
okay so before I talk about the new

166
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,889
model right I want to look at you know

167
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,750
why we even want to talk about a new

168
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:42,000
model there are some problems with this

169
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,440
kind of three-tiered model and some

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,610
reasons why it might be a legacy model I

171
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,099
think there's kind of three reasons that

172
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,930
the three-tier model is showing its age

173
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,120
right so one is directionality we talked

174
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,530
about this little already this idea of

175
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
the difference between north-south

176
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,340
traffic versus east-west traffic right

177
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
so that directional change makes things

178
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:00,570
different it makes you wanna be able to

179
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,310
move traffic across the data center more

180
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,479
than just getting it in or out right and

181
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,280
I think that's also happening you know

182
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,780
in other places as well and then you

183
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,919
know if we can call it directional the

184
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,570
difference in scale right would you want

185
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,150
to scale up but it's building buying

186
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,770
bigger and bigger boxes or scale out by

187
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:18,270
adding more small boxes or even virtual

188
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:20,310
devices right so the second problem is

189
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,080
is in resiliency right you know

190
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,570
spanning-tree sucks blocking half your

191
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,490
links just doesn't make any sense and

192
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,960
then you know this plays back into that

193
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,190
scale of versus scale out but if you

194
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,530
want redundancy in a three-term model

195
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,669
you're you're building in redundancy at

196
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:33,888
all three layers in order to provide

197
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,359
we're going to see for the whole system

198
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:37,770
which also probably sucks cuz you're

199
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,970
paying for a lot of boxes again that

200
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,780
aren't even being used because of

201
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,750
spanning tree blocking

202
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,950
dr. breeland's and really what Ellis

203
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,479
comes down to is this idea of hardware

204
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,289
centricity right so you're talking

205
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,419
it's kind of you know

206
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,650
vertically-integrated mainframe Peck

207
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,688
device that we call uh switch or a

208
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,859
router and especially when you look at

209
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:54,360
like that distribution or a creation

210
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,009
layer where those services live and

211
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,779
those services are tied to those boxes

212
00:06:56,009 --> 00:07:00,839
so if you want to add a new feature you

213
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:03,419
better replace hardware that's not super

214
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,830
great for network reliability enough

215
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:06,599
time right if you're trying to get to

216
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,099
you know whatever number of nines you're

217
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:10,050
shooting for having to actually shut

218
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:12,870
something down to turn it off to replace

219
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,259
it is really really hard on those uptime

220
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:17,370
numbers right also you know because that

221
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,960
physical connectivity is part of this

222
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,550
new talk about physical devices where

223
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,448
you actually connect things matters so

224
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,830
you actually like you have to worry

225
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,210
about you know where things live and how

226
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,550
they connect it in and how the packet

227
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,498
fording goes through that you know is

228
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:30,539
one of the reasons why things like micro

229
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:32,009
segmentation didn't take off very early

230
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:34,020
cuz like routing everything up through a

231
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,029
big firewall and back down isn't super

232
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,639
practical right so being able to do

233
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:39,990
other things makes it more practical and

234
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,479
then also you know a lot of cases this

235
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:44,219
is this you know kind of manual box by

236
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,109
box configuration and then like I said

237
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:49,169
feature velocity right so you know am I

238
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:51,210
willing to upgrade the software package

239
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,770
on my router that's potentially gonna

240
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,748
take down my whole network for one

241
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,909
feature or not and that question leads

242
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:59,719
to probably a little slower agility and

243
00:07:56,909 --> 00:08:03,659
you know to add new features and add new

244
00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:06,959
services to your network right okay so

245
00:08:03,659 --> 00:08:08,459
no personalization right this is kind of

246
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,240
the thing that is allowing us to get

247
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:10,709
past this where I would say

248
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,419
virtualization and automation together

249
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,219
are probably the keys to kind of move

250
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,529
into this new model right so in order

251
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:18,599
for chelation the first piece is network

252
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,430
function virtualization right creating

253
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,199
virtual network functions so taking

254
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,779
things that hardware devices used to do

255
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,830
and moving those into software so you

256
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:27,569
can do this with almost all kinds of

257
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,529
things there's some really you know

258
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:30,959
interesting stuff where we've been able

259
00:08:28,529 --> 00:08:33,179
to use CPUs to pass packets better

260
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,159
I built a nice be like in the early

261
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,809
noughties where you know there was no

262
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,669
way we were gonna get to ten gig scale

263
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,078
on the linux bridging routers we were

264
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,130
using you can do that now right you can

265
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:42,478
pass like a massive amounts of traffic

266
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,828
through their servers now which is

267
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,630
really really cool both on Microsoft and

268
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:48,149
Linux it's allowing all that stuff to

269
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:50,040
happen one thing I would note for

270
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:52,800
anybody who's creating virtual network

271
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:54,930
functions simply taking what a device

272
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,370
does and like putting it into a virtual

273
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,660
machine and like fertilizing that and

274
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,250
that's

275
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,779
Nakul but we really want to do is like

276
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,670
rethink the way that those functions

277
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:03,889
work and maybe maybe actually what your

278
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:05,389
device is doing is composable into a set

279
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:07,220
of different micro services they can be

280
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:09,800
set up and then you can drink really get

281
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,709
kind of granular in how you do updates

282
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,329
and changing things so there's a note

283
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:16,430
for anybody who's creating virtual

284
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:18,519
network functions think about you know

285
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,628
how you can leverage the way your

286
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:21,709
virtualizing them to do totally

287
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,029
different things than what you would do

288
00:09:21,709 --> 00:09:25,250
by just kind of taking a physical box

289
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:26,870
and making it a virtual machine

290
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,730
beyond that then the next thing is you

291
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,959
know beside individual devices there's a

292
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,610
network we can virtualize right so this

293
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,069
is kind of a standard way you draw a

294
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,149
virtualized network makes total sense I

295
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,378
think actually is a little bit simpler

296
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,610
way to draw it is if you look at you

297
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:39,980
know this network maybe the smiley faces

298
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,170
or users the checkmarks are our

299
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,160
applications there's some X's in there

300
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:44,660
which you're like routers or switches

301
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,490
and we're really doing we're talking

302
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,540
about referrals ation is we're saying I

303
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,100
don't really care about that physical

304
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,779
network what I want to do is make the

305
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,689
connectivity look like this alright and

306
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,980
in most cases we do that with overlays

307
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,569
you know the hottest ones now are like

308
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,759
the Exxon in Geneva or talked about a

309
00:09:56,569 --> 00:10:01,969
lot a lot of people I think freaked out

310
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,529
about overlays and it's just the whole

311
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,930
concept of tunneling traffic in that

312
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:07,370
kind of stuff I think that it's really

313
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,609
important to remember that they're not

314
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:12,439
new right we've been using VLANs MPLS

315
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,459
GRE a piece act like I mean with all

316
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:15,410
these two names acknowledged we've been

317
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:18,529
overlaying that works for a long long

318
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,899
time also even just like the whole OSI

319
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:22,699
model is a way to understand overlaying

320
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:25,189
networks right your obstacle ring of

321
00:10:22,699 --> 00:10:26,750
fiber in a city has very little to do

322
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:28,399
with the way the Ethernet connectivity

323
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,199
across that you know Metro Ethernet

324
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,550
network might work versus the way you're

325
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:33,170
actually IP routing between your own

326
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,089
services or applications right so like

327
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:37,610
the overlays are just the way we do

328
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:38,800
networking so you know don't beat you

329
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:45,040
scared

330
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,040
so all right finally the new model right

331
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,769
there's two ideas I think that really

332
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:51,559
kind of over what like led me to this

333
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:53,389
way of like thinking about this networks

334
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:54,680
in a new way I think kind of right so

335
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:56,569
the first one is what I'm going to

336
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,829
switch inception and the second one is

337
00:10:56,569 --> 00:11:01,250
router explosion so we'll look at each

338
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:03,649
one here so the first thing is this idea

339
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,290
of switches and switches right and the

340
00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:08,240
comparison of a folded Claus Network

341
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,900
like the leaf line Network versus what a

342
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,210
multi-chip switch

343
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,350
looks like and the potential to maybe

344
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:15,750
have more visibility control by

345
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,690
exploding that switch right so let's

346
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,490
take a look at this leaf spine Network

347
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,529
right the folder claws your spine

348
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,640
switches that are all connected to you

349
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,290
know every spine is negative every leaf

350
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,510
every loose connected every spine pretty

351
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:29,219
standard but let's you know if we pull

352
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,779
the sheet metal back on a multi-chip

353
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,700
switch like a big chassis switch what

354
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,730
does it look like well it's got fabric

355
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:37,350
chips that are connected to Avery and PU

356
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,860
and every unfuse connected every fabric

357
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,390
is yep

358
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,980
so that's interesting so just in case

359
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,370
you missed it I'm gonna go again there's

360
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:45,240
the Claus Network multi-chip switch very

361
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,440
very similar right

362
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,170
so it's interesting you can you can

363
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:53,940
think about any cmp network as just a

364
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:56,339
switch right in some ways and the second

365
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:01,770
thing is this idea of router explosion

366
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:03,480
right so if you're using you know some

367
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,560
kind of Sdn controller or even just like

368
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,510
you know an automation framework we've

369
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,400
got something driving that that you can

370
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,439
look at that controller as a writing

371
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,660
engine or any processor or supervisor or

372
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,310
whatever and then you virtualized these

373
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,829
Network functions those virtual network

374
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:18,150
functions become like PF these packet

375
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:19,830
forwarding engines or LAN cards right

376
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:21,240
and then your tunnels become virtual

377
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:25,110
circuits between this so you can almost

378
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,180
look at this as one big router right so

379
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,339
to illustrate that you can look at kind

380
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,469
of is essentially what a router looks

381
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,790
like you got writing protocols that are

382
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:35,220
feeding information into the routing

383
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,599
engine which maintains the routing table

384
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,680
it's then feeding information out

385
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,100
through writing protocols to other

386
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,079
devices it's also talking to the PPS or

387
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,580
line cards which are holding their

388
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,350
forwarding table like the five is down

389
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,690
there and they're using that to to

390
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,530
connect to physical interfaces to kind

391
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,720
of make the whole thing work right

392
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,100
that's essentially how it works

393
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,740
and what's interesting is if you look at

394
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:59,880
you know like an SDN or a controller

395
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,620
based network it's super similar again

396
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,089
you've got maybe now you've got routing

397
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,560
protocols and api's that are feeding

398
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:07,290
into a controller which maintains the

399
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,760
routing table and then it can also feed

400
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,110
out information through protocols or API

401
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,580
eyes it's talking to virtual network

402
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,839
functions that can live almost anywhere

403
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,160
right there can be on your servers

404
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,250
potentially they could be on the

405
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,360
supercomputer you carry in your pocket

406
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,950
potentially anywhere and they maintain

407
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,780
the 14 table which then talk to you know

408
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,839
physical or virtual interfaces right so

409
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:28,260
again router

410
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,310
stn very similar right so I mean you can

411
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:30,660
start to see where I'm going with this

412
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,219
if we take this kind of network the way

413
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,050
this looks and we say okay instead of

414
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,880
kind of dealing with all of these like

415
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:37,920
physical boxes in the middle there if we

416
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,300
kind of look at this as pushing those as

417
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,160
virtual network functions into the edge

418
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,620
devices and you've got a kind of

419
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,730
distributed centralized control plane

420
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,320
there in the middle those like

421
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:48,450
exclamation points are kind of you know

422
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,769
Sdn controllers or the you know whatever

423
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,230
automation engine you have driving this

424
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:54,180
thing you can look at this as one big

425
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,110
distributed router essentially obviously

426
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,120
you still need physical connectivity

427
00:13:55,110 --> 00:14:00,870
that's where we get this two-tier idea

428
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,720
right so looking at the underlay as a

429
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:06,600
coarse switch and the overlay as an

430
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,920
access router right there's some

431
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,000
characteristics so I think you're

432
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,969
interesting or important to remember

433
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,550
here the underlay is essentially what

434
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:16,440
you wanted to non-blocking you CMP one

435
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:19,709
thing that I'll touch on a little bit as

436
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,260
well but the Internet is a pretty cool V

437
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:23,880
CMP network to use as an underlay in

438
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,040
general also you want this to be

439
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,290
resilient and high bandwidth and then

440
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,529
it's made of physical devices right for

441
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,540
now no matter how much we love software

442
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:34,920
Asics and cables and things like that

443
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,779
just have to be there to make a network

444
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,390
work I don't think that's gonna change

445
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,230
anytime soon so again you can make this

446
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,180
rock-solid

447
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:45,000
you know IP fabric that is your underlay

448
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,099
and then on the top you build tunnels

449
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,610
they can do hashing to take advantage of

450
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,350
the ecmp

451
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:52,050
you can do policy-based routing source

452
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:53,910
based routing once you've moved the

453
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,979
intelligence of the routing into you

454
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,360
know servers instead of resource

455
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,709
constrained routers and switches you can

456
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,040
do almost anything you want right some

457
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:03,029
really really cool stuff with

458
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,050
application based routing and some

459
00:15:03,029 --> 00:15:05,130
interesting things that right and

460
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,490
obviously these are these are virtual

461
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,899
devices so again right what we're

462
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,579
talking about is you know connectivity

463
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:13,470
and hardware that rock-solid platform to

464
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:16,050
build the song and then routing policy

465
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:17,970
services security all that stuff in

466
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,810
software above it they can kind of live

467
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:23,339
wherever it needs to okay so why is that

468
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,268
interesting right was like so when it

469
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,459
hit me like I thought you could think

470
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:28,980
about this thing is like you know course

471
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,689
which is actually your whole underlay

472
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,709
physical platform and the access router

473
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,899
is actually your whole kind of

474
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:35,399
virtualized software services overlay

475
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:37,209
but why is that interesting right I

476
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,860
think there's a couple reasons

477
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:40,118
one is you know just theoretically

478
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,009
thinking about this it allows you to

479
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:43,749
focus on what matters so if you kind of

480
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:45,519
look at this in the two-tiered way you

481
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:47,339
can look at okay what is the physical

482
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,089
underlay need to provide for my network

483
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,619
which is you know that rocks love

484
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,149
reliability high bandwidth all those

485
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:53,769
things you can really focus on just

486
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:54,819
doing those things and then okay when

487
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:56,230
I'm building services what are those

488
00:15:54,819 --> 00:15:57,399
need to provide and you can just focus

489
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,899
on those things so kind of that that's

490
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:59,980
separation of church and state you know

491
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:01,209
what to focus on what matters I think is

492
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,470
interesting just from kind of a

493
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,258
conceptual way of looking at the network

494
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,970
you can really kind of stop trying to do

495
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:09,879
everything in the device and look at you

496
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,559
know where that actually should live in

497
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,929
practicality I think one of the biggest

498
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,730
things is scale right so if you move a

499
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:17,949
lot of the intelligence of what your

500
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:19,899
network needs to do into servers you

501
00:16:17,949 --> 00:16:22,240
essentially have you know I mean maybe

502
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:23,589
maybe infinite is too big of a word but

503
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,879
you know you can throw servers at this

504
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,610
thing all day so you can do almost

505
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,800
anything you want also like the update

506
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,910
cycle right so because you've detached

507
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,618
if you think about you know if you build

508
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,179
a rock-solid underlay that you don't

509
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:35,860
change very often it's just passing high

510
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:37,480
volumes of packets very very well and

511
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:39,730
you don't touch that then you can

512
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:41,589
innovate in services right so you can

513
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,879
change things at the service layer and

514
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,799
they only impact people who are using

515
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,329
those services you can do you know

516
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,429
smaller surgical updates things like

517
00:16:46,329 --> 00:16:50,258
that adding features all that without

518
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:53,470
affecting the whole system which i think

519
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:54,369
is why it's a super interesting one

520
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,779
essentially what you're doing is kind of

521
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:58,360
treating this universal network platform

522
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,309
right so by having you know the central

523
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,509
kind of whether it's you know Sdn or

524
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:03,040
just an automation framework or whatever

525
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:04,329
you wanted to use there you're pushing

526
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,918
out consistent policy to all of your

527
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:07,270
devices kind of looking at that is this

528
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,679
one single access router that's super

529
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,609
interesting also the same thing because

530
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:11,319
you're kind of looking at this in these

531
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:12,458
two planes it provides simplicity so you

532
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,199
can think about these things model these

533
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,819
things in your mind and then potentially

534
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,770
more visibility as well to tie this all

535
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,709
together into a single system versus

536
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,908
looking at box by box devices and then

537
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:23,079
also like I said because it's universal

538
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:24,339
network platform I think of some

539
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,980
interesting things around you know you

540
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,029
know what a potentially unified domains

541
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:30,220
this idea that the wind is the new land

542
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:31,240
I followed my employees by feeling at

543
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,740
corporate networks right my employees

544
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,360
are walking around with with phones in

545
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,980
their pockets and laptops and then

546
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,840
everything that I'm using is either in

547
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:40,510
you know a public cloud or SAS based

548
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,010
service so we know where is my network

549
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:44,379
and then how do I manage my network and

550
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,549
I think this is this model can help you

551
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,370
leap down that path of how to figure

552
00:17:45,549 --> 00:17:50,120
that out

553
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,550
right so you know I'm

554
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,320
I try not to create new buzzwords too

555
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,090
often and in cloud integrated network is

556
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,770
better than Sdn for this kind of idea

557
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,120
we're we're kind of you know embedding

558
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,710
the cloud into the network right which

559
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,909
is pushing compute resources for the

560
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,340
further out I'll listen you know talk

561
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,800
about IOT and the need for compute

562
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:08,059
further out at the edge cloud right also

563
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,740
taking the network to the public cloud

564
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:10,580
which is this idea of multi cloud and

565
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,080
how to actually connect all these things

566
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,889
together and that's where you know once

567
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,760
you've realized you need those two

568
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:15,140
things right if you're pushing these

569
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,730
things out then I kind of need this

570
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,710
Universal network platform which is I

571
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,570
think what this model helps to

572
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,410
understand obviously just aggregation of

573
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,730
virtualization and automation

574
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,410
orchestration and telemetry analytics

575
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:29,390
are all pieces and parts of kind of

576
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:30,860
using this model more practically use

577
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,880
cases right so I think if you look at

578
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:33,800
some server spiders that have been built

579
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,929
recently they are already doing this

580
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,919
right so I'm sure some of you maybe

581
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:38,900
you've already fallen asleep and it's

582
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,750
like yeah I get it man does how we do

583
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,370
things that's fine

584
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,450
obviously like I said earlier you know

585
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,010
kind of using the internet as an

586
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,510
underlay that's the whole idea of SDN

587
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,700
we're just going you know pretty

588
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,770
interesting and on the enterprise side I

589
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:54,110
think is super super interesting as this

590
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,190
kind of moves into you know large

591
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:56,659
enterprises and then down

592
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,370
as there again as they're using more

593
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,080
public resources the D parameter is

594
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,790
ation of the corporate network is really

595
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,320
interesting to me and how we actually

596
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,120
deal with that one of the sponsors

597
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:06,230
actually has a cool solution to that if

598
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,389
you want to know about it you can talk

599
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:09,920
to me which is this idea of like how do

600
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,929
we actually connect people to the things

601
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,880
they need to connect to when you know

602
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:15,620
but a lot of the networks and services

603
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,880
or a lot of the networks and hardware

604
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,770
that those things live on don't actually

605
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,710
belong to me right my user owns his own

606
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:23,870
phone you know some big cloud provider

607
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:25,640
owns the servers some you know inter a

608
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,590
service provider owns the connectivity

609
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,120
between them so well you know what do I

610
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,949
actually do and this overlay idea I

611
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,909
think is a way to potentially regain

612
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:37,910
control and manage that if I don't a

613
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,870
controller so you do a VPN right and so

614
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,010
this is kind of digging into

615
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:42,050
specifically into the data center use

616
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:44,390
case which I think this is this model is

617
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,790
more broad than that but you can do this

618
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,500
without you know true Sdn right you can

619
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:49,790
use VPN and if you just use automation

620
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,410
to do configurations you can still get

621
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,550
some of the benefits of this you really

622
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,700
do need that automation framework I

623
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,260
think whether it's you know through sold

624
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,320
as I stay in control or something else

625
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,850
to get really at the benefits another

626
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,960
thing I can't talk about this without

627
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,230
somebody saying well what about open

628
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,029
flow

629
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:09,769
or you know we really need to do is do

630
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:10,909
Native Sdn overlays suck you know as

631
00:20:09,769 --> 00:20:12,139
I've mentioned the word a couple times

632
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,909
there's this thing called the Internet

633
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:15,469
it's already out there we're not going

634
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:18,260
to convert every device on the Internet

635
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,940
into open flow based devices and even if

636
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,340
we did you probably don't give me access

637
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:24,380
to your devices to me to send open flow

638
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,399
commands to them so that's not really

639
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,929
gonna work right you don't ever have to

640
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:30,439
replace everything to make this work so

641
00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:32,510
overlays are pretty cool too just not to

642
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,399
worry about that another interesting

643
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,929
thing that I thought about in this is

644
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,129
this idea of the return to end and right

645
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:38,720
so a lot of us place bets on I could be

646
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,830
six of like trying to get you know back

647
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,419
to the end-to-end model and getting rid

648
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:42,740
of all these you know nat devices and

649
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,840
all these middle boxes well the cool

650
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,100
thing is if you're moving all services

651
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,320
to software and you're pushing that to

652
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,209
the edge you potentially have a clearer

653
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,549
network path between the devices and you

654
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:55,639
can put those services and things at the

655
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:57,250
actual you know back at the edge kind of

656
00:20:55,639 --> 00:21:01,428
I don't know we'll see

657
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:02,659
so in conclusion here right one thing I

658
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:04,159
do wanna remember is you know the map is

659
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:06,470
not the terrain obviously this is a

660
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,179
model it's just something that I think

661
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,850
is kind of helpful as a way to think

662
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:12,590
about networks it's not you know gonna

663
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,760
be exactly you know it's obviously not a

664
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:18,709
reference architecture any things like

665
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:20,179
that just a tool you can use and it's in

666
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,659
in final summer here right so overlays

667
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:23,059
are normal

668
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,470
I think models are helpful it is a

669
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,760
digital world software is king like I

670
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:28,700
think that needs to feed our thinking

671
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,289
even the network space use the - alright

672
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:34,309
think of your underlay is a core switch

673
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:36,200
your overlay as an access router and I

674
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,789
think you'll be able to see the problems

675
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:46,090
you're facing and potentially a slightly

676
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:50,169
new light any questions or comments

677
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,168
thinly disguised as questions

678
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:02,940
I'm Spencer Dawkins one of the transport

679
00:21:57,030 --> 00:22:04,500
area directors at the IETF I you you

680
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,540
said that thing about overlays are

681
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,000
normal and what I was getting from your

682
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,879
presentation is that they're more than

683
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,150
normal that you want to make them kind

684
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,280
of a first-class part of the internet

685
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,080
because it seems like to me that we

686
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,660
where we've gotten so far has been

687
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,129
pretty ad hoc with you know it's like

688
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:25,620
well we could encapsulate this and we

689
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,230
can you know tell that and you know like

690
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:31,110
so it seems like you're trying to make

691
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:34,980
this a more well-structured idea then

692
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:42,649
we've gotten to you know so far which I

693
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:45,540
which I really like I was curious about

694
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:48,050
what you quote whether it makes a

695
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:51,980
difference if somebody is using their

696
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:59,399
overlay network to provide another

697
00:22:51,980 --> 00:23:03,420
cloud-enabled network and I am curious

698
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:07,380
about whether you're advocating that the

699
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:10,170
underlays fix a lot of the challenges

700
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,250
that we have today which we talked about

701
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:17,990
and you know as recently as in this room

702
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:20,610
yesterday during the p4 tutorial about

703
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:23,070
fragments and it kept so you know and

704
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:26,250
extension headers and things like that

705
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:28,740
which are a challenge but maybe you're

706
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:30,990
making the set of challenges small

707
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,630
enough to where they'd be more tractable

708
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,780
Oh in India under in the underlaid

709
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:40,050
Network and I'm curious about what you

710
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:42,059
think the managing overlays and

711
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:44,550
underlays looks like looked like if

712
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:48,420
you're moving into a world where there's

713
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:49,379
a lot of encrypted traffic yeah there's

714
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,780
other questions I don't know that I have

715
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,040
great answers specific I think the

716
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,320
encrypted traffic thing is definitely

717
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:57,540
interesting but again I think if you're

718
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,620
you know one of the reasons that pushing

719
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,240
services as close to the edge as

720
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,469
possible is interesting is it perhaps

721
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,230
you can do

722
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,820
whatever you know middle box type magic

723
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,230
you would have done in the middle now

724
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,760
you're doing at the edge you know at the

725
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,080
place of encryption which is you know

726
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,580
potentially helpful

727
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,560
now whether or not that word of

728
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,480
operations actually works you know we do

729
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,950
you know depend on who you trust to see

730
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,540
the traffic before you encrypt it is it

731
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,140
maybe another question but I think it's

732
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,600
possibly helpful I'm stepping down after

733
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,370
after three terms as transport area

734
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,340
director and I think what you just said

735
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,949
there is one of the most helpful things

736
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:39,889
that I've heard of this very challenging

737
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:43,589
process thank you thank you thank you

738
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,589
[Applause]

739
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,830
you
