1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,080
I'm delighted to be here again as for

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,030
those you remember we made that speech

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,490
at the last nanog giving preliminary

4
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,689
results of this work that we're doing

5
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:21,000
which is being funded by the National

6
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:23,430
Science Foundation and I should ask sa

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,660
great thank you both to Andre and Artyom

8
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,779
for actually setting up this

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,130
presentation so well as Andre pointed

10
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,140
out there is a need there are non

11
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,549
technical dimensions whether collective

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,010
action and otherwise the whole

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:37,440
motivation of this project is comments

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,089
from actually in previous nanog so

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,910
members of this community and other

16
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,820
places that there are legal barriers

17
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,000
that were retarding the adoption of rpki

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,679
and that we needed some independent

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,809
study of someone with sufficient

20
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,780
technical expertise and legal expertise

21
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,160
to be able to solve this problem in this

22
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,079
sense I'm a bit of a unicorn in the

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,659
sense I have both appointments in

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,609
computer science and in law and so they

25
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:04,890
tapped me to do this and asked me to

26
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,380
explore this and to really understand

27
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,120
the dimensions to the whip to look take

28
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,649
a deep dive into the interaction between

29
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,470
the legal aspects of the adoption

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,930
methods to see what what recommendations

31
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,179
we can come of possible changes to

32
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,220
smooth through those issues and I have

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,960
to thank Marty m24 I'm actually sailing

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,469
with a stage very nicely he talked about

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,559
the tragic story about rpki and talked

36
00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:30,270
about how he is unduly pessimistic at

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,130
the risk of being the Pollyanna that he

38
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,259
is not I'm gonna tell you an optimistic

39
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,140
story which is this has been a really

40
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,110
remarkable year for rpki in many many

41
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:43,500
ways so for example many of the large

42
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,170
providers who are players in the space

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,750
who have not been who have been studying

44
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,670
and watching rpki for a long time we've

45
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,829
seen a series of announcements of very

46
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,140
active involvement in the RPK world

47
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:57,600
that's gonna actually start unlocking

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,670
the benefits as more people deploy the

49
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,070
technology as opposed to be probably no

50
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:05,009
CloudFlare is actually issuing Roiz and

51
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,369
is actually doing a certain amount of

52
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,770
filtering ntt we'll come back to that in

53
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:12,090
a minute the big news that circulate

54
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,380
through the list and Nimrod will talk

55
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,330
about later or one of his lightning

56
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,609
talks is AT&T is begun actively

57
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,260
filtering routes based on rpki based

58
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,150
information the excellent presentation

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:23,609
by manners manners

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,329
incorporated some type of route

61
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,920
validation into its requirements its AB

62
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:30,900
Gnostic about particular technologies

63
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,359
but in candid conversations with manners

64
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,790
as of now there are no alternative

65
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,909
technologies on the spots on the horizon

66
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:40,379
there's announcement that Google is made

67
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:42,060
that they have actually become flagging

68
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:44,069
routes for some time and expect to begin

69
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,780
actively filtering route 2 later this

70
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:51,629
year and what's fascinating to me is we

71
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,900
there was a workshop co-lead by Doug

72
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,790
Montgomery at NIST Martin levy at

73
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,120
CloudFlare and yobs

74
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,150
Jobe Snyder's at NTT about yesterday or

75
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:05,450
Sunday about how to deploy our PKI and

76
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,209
at which point I learned that in fact

77
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,399
CloudFlare is deploying a new validator

78
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:13,650
software called octo rpki which all of

79
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,180
us know is a a robust set of software

80
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,269
options is a very welcome part of the

81
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,670
space I skipped over the NTT aspect this

82
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:23,069
is a fairly novel idea where they're

83
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,399
actually using route origin information

84
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:28,888
incorporating that into IR rs-24 active

85
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,160
route management and so these are really

86
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:34,319
interesting developments that have

87
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,629
helped take the RPK off the back burner

88
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,638
where has been for so long and an issue

89
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:41,190
on people's agenda and really pushing it

90
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,169
to the top of the agenda and so I think

91
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,180
that there's a lot of reason for

92
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,340
optimism today based on the level of

93
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,919
interest that the last nine I don't come

94
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,599
this one there is a bit of a puzzle

95
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,340
which is or one of the motivating

96
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,978
problems there's a general problem with

97
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,780
rpki adoption which is it only takes

98
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,549
hold when a sufficient number of other

99
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,010
people are actually signing routes and

100
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,419
filtering routes but there's independent

101
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,129
of that a different problem which is

102
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,620
there's a differential level of adoption

103
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,540
in the ripe region than there is in

104
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:11,729
other parts of the world in particular

105
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:14,129
ripe is by far the strongest lack nichts

106
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:16,019
is a second and Aaron actually at one

107
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:18,209
point if I based on the data I showed

108
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,500
you the last Nanog actually the the

109
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,229
percentage of the routes that have been

110
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,400
signed of the abhorrent of the origins

111
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,080
that have been signed was actually

112
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,789
declining for a brief amount of time and

113
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,139
actually it's bumped backed up but it's

114
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,539
still flat to where it was about several

115
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,099
years ago within the Arin region and so

116
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,539
here you start to realize that there may

117
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:34,620
be something you try to look for

118
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,090
regional differences

119
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,790
and how they approach it as a basic

120
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,340
research methodology that's the signing

121
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,949
side on the filtering side what we're

122
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,599
discovering is that Ben Cartwright Cox

123
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,520
has done some nice studies that discover

124
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,979
that 80% of the people who are engaging

125
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,599
and filtering are only using four towels

126
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,969
from four region and have not deployed

127
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,560
the errand towel and so there seems to

128
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,090
be and there's other data coming out of

129
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,400
AP make that sort of draws similar

130
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,049
conclusions so are a lot of the

131
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,479
motivation part of it is to try to

132
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,820
facilitate rpki generally but to try to

133
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:07,469
study the problem to understand if

134
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,659
there's something unique about the Erin

135
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,389
situation in the legal context in which

136
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,400
it operates that may explain some of the

137
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,340
differences be given that that might not

138
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,049
be as uniform and so what we've seen is

139
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,570
that's the basic idea

140
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,400
we made this presentation earlier based

141
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,260
on the input from this community and I

142
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,448
have to really thank this entire

143
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,099
community and Erin in particular for

144
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,720
being involved in a very active dialogue

145
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,639
to really understand this problem and

146
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,260
I'm actually really hardened to see that

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,930
we're a lot of the discussions are

148
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,909
moving past law and to the real

149
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,470
operational issues that are gonna lie at

150
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,120
the heart of the ultimate success or

151
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,180
failure of securing the internet through

152
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,419
rpki we published a report to the Nanog

153
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,919
list and December 31st of this year this

154
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,080
will make all of you cringe but lawyers

155
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,080
are pretty easy about this it's 34 pages

156
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,760
warning in advance so but it goes

157
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,859
through the issues hopefully in a way

158
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:01,289
that is and we're told is fairly

159
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,830
accessible and that in fact there's a

160
00:06:01,289 --> 00:06:06,360
lot of movement already in terms of

161
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:08,729
cleaning up some of the clauses in the

162
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,160
legacy RSA cleaning up some of the

163
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:12,960
action the making broader use of the

164
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,030
prohibited conduct clause which we

165
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,739
talked about last time which frankly

166
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,020
have already been incorporated into

167
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,360
Erin's work streams and processes and

168
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,400
we're very encouraged by their active

169
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,099
engagement in this and the real desire

170
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,250
to try to make this work rpki deployed

171
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:31,050
better so one of the big issues that we

172
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,120
have identified is involved something

173
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,860
called the relying party agreement these

174
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,680
are people who would like to use the

175
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,590
information in the in the libraries to

176
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,950
engage in filtering one of the

177
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:46,890
interesting aspects is to access the

178
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,930
trust anchor locator for Erin the

179
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:51,000
current design requires you to go to the

180
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,810
website and click through accept clips

181
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,550
root on the towel itself with the terms

182
00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:00,270
of use prominently displayed on that

183
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,789
page and the reason that works and that

184
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,190
in effect prevents validator software

185
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:07,889
from being distributed with all five

186
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,990
towels the you to get to the Erin towel

187
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:11,700
you have to click through and actually

188
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,620
acknowledge that you've been on that

189
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,320
page and implicitly acknowledge the

190
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,810
terms and that is a distinctive change

191
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,260
but it's an artifact of American law

192
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:24,479
that unless you have something in the

193
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,849
visual field of the person who's

194
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,070
accepting it or using the software you

195
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:30,840
cannot have what would be considered a

196
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,940
binding contract so the interesting

197
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,580
question is on two approaches do you

198
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,320
need a binding contract and one of the

199
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,500
interesting problems that we've gotten

200
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:43,320
run across in the discussion is that

201
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:45,950
there are two solutions one is to

202
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,599
abolish the contract altogether and

203
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,050
simply allow the risks to fall where

204
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:52,320
they may

205
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,630
or you can actually have a contract and

206
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,659
what's interesting is by acid by

207
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,729
changing the environment and putting

208
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:04,680
rpki and now is becoming more a part of

209
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:07,169
the active routing policies of the way

210
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,360
the operational routing procedures of

211
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:12,930
operators like you of the people in this

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,789
room there's a this is a rule that our

213
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,289
IRS had not traditionally played and

214
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:18,750
there's a question about the proper

215
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:21,330
bearing of risks and one of the most

216
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,729
interesting parts of the conversation

217
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:25,940
that came out on Sunday was actually an

218
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:28,020
active difference of opinion among

219
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,260
operators about how to properly

220
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,390
characterize a service like rpki

221
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:38,218
one version is to think of it as you

222
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:41,309
will is an online real time empath

223
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:45,440
function that you use to secure system

224
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:48,000
and that requires constant validity and

225
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,640
current updating the other way is to

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,069
think of it as a security feature that

227
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,560
is separate and added on to the existing

228
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:58,020
system that would be operated day the

229
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,189
updated daily maybe a few times a day

230
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,990
and not be as operationally in line and

231
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:06,570
that's an important distinction to draw

232
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,490
between the two because the risks and

233
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:09,930
what the technical requirements of the

234
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,760
demands of putting something that's in

235
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,130
line in real time are much higher

236
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,319
they'll require different service by

237
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:18,990
every provider in the in the lane in

238
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,459
this in the path and it require it's a

239
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,080
different conception and one of the

240
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,579
things that I'm hoping will happen on

241
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,860
the operator community on the technical

242
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,209
side is an active discussion of which of

243
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,490
those models is really the one that

244
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:32,339
operates one of the things that we are

245
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:34,140
pushing towards is actually there is an

246
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,399
alternative about how you lay off risk

247
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,620
you we're going to present several of

248
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,270
them the current one is a blanket

249
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,550
indemnification clause which we regard

250
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,100
as too strong because it's an

251
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:46,260
indemnification against any relying

252
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,240
parties indemnify the RIR

253
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,819
or miss keys aren against any failure

254
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,290
and that includes failures that are on

255
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,570
aaron's end over which they can't

256
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,160
control they a fairly basic legal

257
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,290
principle is you should be responsible

258
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,209
for things under your control and fran

259
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,649
Beebe honest I'm and the discussions

260
00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:03,689
with Aaron I think they understand that

261
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,060
and are very much engaged in a process

262
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,100
to try to understand a way to redraft

263
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:13,069
that the other interesting alternative

264
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:15,120
is to use a and Aza's disclaimer and

265
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,680
instead of an actual indemnification

266
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,630
clause so you don't actually make them

267
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,060
indemnify against liability you just say

268
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,339
I understand this we take this product

269
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:26,219
without warranties it's what we do with

270
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:26,850
open source and the like under US law to

271
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,890
do that

272
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,560
for that disclaimer to be valid you need

273
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:32,880
to have a contract and so the part of

274
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,829
the argument is if we're going to shift

275
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,649
from indemnification to and as is

276
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,630
disclaimer under American law there is a

277
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:41,310
pretty strong argument that you would

278
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:43,770
benefit from having some sort of

279
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,359
agreement this is a just as a

280
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,120
side-by-side comparison

281
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,130
Aaron does require offers not just a

282
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,110
disclaimer or warranties but a

283
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,420
requirement the relying party agreement

284
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:57,140
requires an duty to indemnify defend and

285
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,640
hold harmless and it applies to all

286
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:02,459
actions taken by any party not just the

287
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,779
ones by you this contrasts with afrinic

288
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:06,900
and lactic which have no agreement

289
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:09,990
whatsoever ap NIC has no agreement but

290
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,310
has on line terms and conditions which

291
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:14,040
under certain areas of law would

292
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,529
contract it includes indemnification but

293
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,930
not defender hold harmless and the right

294
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:21,180
NCC oh it has online Terms and

295
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,650
Conditions no actual contract but only

296
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,900
the disclaimer of warranties no

297
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,640
indemnification no hold harmless and no

298
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,079
duty to defend and so we have a

299
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,240
difference here and we're looking at

300
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,320
different ways they could work it's

301
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,710
interesting that for many people if you

302
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,839
one of the great sports I have is we are

303
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:41,100
concerned about our essays and relying

304
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,500
part of the agreements what we're

305
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,450
starting to see is that these

306
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,880
indemnification clauses are used in

307
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,460
other places on other agreements with

308
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,800
aaron including our essays and even for

309
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,589
people who are in the legacy space if

310
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,640
you have an ipv6 address you forgot an

311
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:01,230
RSA so it's hard to understand exactly

312
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,500
causally how big an obstacle this

313
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:08,160
specific one is our suggestion is to

314
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,200
take an as to shift to keep the contract

315
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,600
but embody in it to it and as is

316
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,670
disclaimer of warranties that allows

317
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,040
everyone to understand that the product

318
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,209
and with proper disclosure of what the

319
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,890
technical requirements and

320
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,670
availabilities are which is part of the

321
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:23,189
conversation

322
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:24,569
that started happening on Sunday that

323
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,150
can actually work as a very effective

324
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:29,280
way to move us through to a solution

325
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:31,620
where our PK is more broadly adopted and

326
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,110
this is really an interesting question a

327
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,640
broader question about other communities

328
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,640
to discuss enrichment and risk

329
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:41,939
management is that if it is a work

330
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,460
stream that you want to be available on

331
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,890
and redressable within an hour or

332
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,150
minutes that requires a higher degree in

333
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:49,800
a different kind of technical support

334
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:52,020
and if that's something that's this

335
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,609
community wants to do they're gonna have

336
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,560
to discuss ways to manage the risk and

337
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,959
to fund the resources that's going to

338
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,729
take to make that possible it's

339
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,770
interesting in the sunday workshop many

340
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,170
people it wasn't the concern was not

341
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:06,209
being able to get the problem addressed

342
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,130
immediately but just from a pure

343
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:11,550
operational standpoint they needed to

344
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:13,589
log errors with Aaron and even if it

345
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:16,199
wasn't gonna be redressed for hours or

346
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:19,080
even a day that would be fine they just

347
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,300
needed the person in the operator to get

348
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,130
it off their work stream and that put a

349
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:24,630
flag or a ticket and someone else's work

350
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:26,189
stream and they can just wait for

351
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,930
to be cleared which is sort of an

352
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,700
interesting intermediate position that

353
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:33,239
simplifies the operations on the

354
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:35,550
operator side but creates a much less

355
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,110
onerous service responsibility on the

356
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:40,170
people up to make sure rpki is

357
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,180
functioning properly what's really

358
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:44,880
encouraging is the idea of a new

359
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:48,329
validator software the one being done by

360
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,310
a CloudFlare called octo rpki one of the

361
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,830
interesting problems as we said is that

362
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,900
as of now all validators are only

363
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,210
distributed with four towels it requires

364
00:13:54,900 --> 00:14:00,120
more to get to the fifth towel and them

365
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:03,630
to the errant towel and there's actually

366
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:08,520
really encouraging signs that we that

367
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:11,700
aaron has said in conversation that they

368
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,790
are open to incorporating the validate

369
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,440
the approval of the RPA into the

370
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,180
acceptance procedures for the validator

371
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,830
software so to the extent to which

372
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,280
that's part of a click through to make

373
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,080
that work you can probably get that

374
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,270
possibly incorporated without actually

375
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,860
requiring a separate click one of the

376
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,630
things we're actually in flooring is

377
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,270
enterprise level agreements so it's not

378
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:35,460
every deployment if an enterprise has an

379
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:37,350
agreement to the RP a you do not need

380
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,760
separate agreement for every instance

381
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:41,190
you want to stand up or you're deploying

382
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:43,110
it to simplify this more and more and

383
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,030
we're looking into that to see if that's

384
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:47,760
going to work and in fact what we have

385
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:50,250
now is a possibility of new validators

386
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,870
act incorporating the fifth towel and

387
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,170
coming to some kind of agreement of this

388
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,820
type that would allow we would achieve

389
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:59,370
the goal we would all have which is to

390
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:01,380
have all the towels distributed as

391
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,390
broadly as possible because unless they

392
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,050
are the entire security environment

393
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,250
won't work in the same way we'd hope

394
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:10,079
interestingly there's a prohibited

395
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,880
conduct clause in current Aaron's

396
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,830
current document which they've already

397
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,050
indicated a willingness to change it

398
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,910
actually prohibits sharing of rpki

399
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:21,569
information in any machine readable

400
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:24,839
format as you know any security world

401
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:27,720
requires analysis of past results as in

402
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,660
not real-time operations and that's into

403
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,340
that technically is prohibited Aaron is

404
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,740
flat-out sent for machine readable

405
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,500
formats for stuff that's not for

406
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,430
operations that's an easy ascent a

407
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,860
change they can

408
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,329
to make to this Klaus and Martin signal

409
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,580
that willingness at the last nanog

410
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:48,000
what's interesting more and more is the

411
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:51,540
possibility as exemplified by entity's

412
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,350
decision to use our PKI information to

413
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,689
improve the IRR table that they maintain

414
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:00,330
that that is going to begin using in

415
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:02,580
operational purposes and there isn't

416
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:05,580
currently explorations going on about

417
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:08,820
appropriate ways to enable third-party

418
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,290
providers or other people combining rpki

419
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:12,779
information with other sorts of

420
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:14,430
information to create a better more

421
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,040
robust sense of what routing information

422
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,660
is about good routes we all know that

423
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,760
all we have many sources of information

424
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:23,370
of routes they all are varying

425
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,410
provenance varying quality and the idea

426
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,170
of using multiple sources and to combine

427
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,910
and together it has the potential to

428
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:34,140
create a much more robust and much more

429
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:35,760
secure routing environment so our

430
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,350
recommendation is a look at these

431
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,420
third-party solutions and some

432
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,220
adaptation of the prohibited conduct

433
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,810
clause in ways that will certainly

434
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:44,910
facilitate the kind of research and

435
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:46,739
analysis that's necessary but in

436
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:49,500
appropriate cases in ways that manage

437
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,120
your risk try to find agreements and

438
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,560
ways to allocate those or

439
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,980
responsibilities that allow the

440
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,779
distribution of that information to be

441
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,550
so that can be provided by third parties

442
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,830
operationally or it be combined with

443
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,678
other information to improve the routing

444
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:07,020
environment from one of the more

445
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,640
interesting recommendations we make and

446
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,040
we were very interested in dialogue

447
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,140
about this is to the extent it's a

448
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,359
concern about limiting the liability for

449
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:17,790
this new service a classic legal

450
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,520
solution is to separate the functions of

451
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:22,920
rpki that is the certificate registries

452
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,230
and maintaining and signing on a

453
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:29,490
delegated basis into a separate company

454
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:31,410
a separate entity that would stand alone

455
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,260
and would allow and the way the

456
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,850
companies work is if it's independent

457
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,320
the liability would not then flow to

458
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:42,030
anyone else this is got some potential

459
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,540
and we have a lot of experience of this

460
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,950
in other contexts it does require

461
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,690
standing up a new organization a certain

462
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,000
amount of overhead a certain amount of

463
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,940
engagement from the community this is

464
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,740
something that

465
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,720
actually once we get to this stage we

466
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,120
can simply tee up the legal alternative

467
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,639
and its benefits but it's ultimately for

468
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,350
the community of operators to decide and

469
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:04,870
the people on the internet governance

470
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,219
side to decide if that makes sense and

471
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:10,330
if that's a solution that would like to

472
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:12,299
be explored what's and to do that you

473
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,309
could untether it from errant operations

474
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:17,230
in fact it can insulate there's a number

475
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:19,960
of other concerns about having an

476
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:22,360
organization a particular type of

477
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,610
organization a us-based organization in

478
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,168
a position to deal with the certificate

479
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:28,269
registries there's some potential to

480
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:30,309
create some additional benefits there is

481
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:34,570
some history about the reluctance to

482
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:36,759
create a global towel that is a problem

483
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:37,960
that many people immediately say well if

484
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:40,269
you have a separate company will it

485
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,559
include just one Aran's the RPA

486
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:44,019
functions should we consider other

487
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:46,149
things many people waive history at me

488
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,980
and as I said on some day there's a

489
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:49,658
statement in law there's nothing more

490
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,190
revolting than doing something the same

491
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:52,870
way because we've done it that way since

492
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,289
the time of Henry the fifth in England

493
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:57,639
we don't history is is you know we got

494
00:18:56,289 --> 00:18:59,950
to get over that and the thing is we're

495
00:18:57,639 --> 00:19:01,899
in a very different situation today than

496
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,120
we were then and we should discuss it

497
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:06,309
debates issues on their own merits about

498
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,830
whether they simply make sense or not

499
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:13,870
and we have other precedents of examples

500
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:15,759
where we've split them off the other

501
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:18,309
thing that's really interesting that

502
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,470
came up in the manners discussion is the

503
00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:22,600
ability the question I forgive me I

504
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,250
don't really have your name but about

505
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,000
whether to harness the power of the

506
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:31,179
community to require from its partners

507
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,789
that they comply with certain security

508
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:35,649
hygiene problems in the end there's a

509
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:38,230
certain amount of weak enforcement you

510
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:40,479
can do like by publicizing this and by

511
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,600
making it visible and making an issue

512
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,769
you can make this a lot stronger by a

513
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,240
building it into procurement

514
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:49,450
requirements and one of the things we're

515
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,850
exploring is whether to build these rpki

516
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,139
capability much into the federal

517
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,379
government or procurement requirements

518
00:19:53,139 --> 00:19:57,969
much as we did with ipv6 but it occurred

519
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:59,830
to us it's not just about government

520
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,440
procurement requirements you know major

521
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,389
partner major companies major providers

522
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,850
equipment thank you fractures everyone

523
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,680
is in a position to include these things

524
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,169
and insist on the people with whom you

525
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,090
write contracts with that some some

526
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:15,190
degree of verifiable compliance with

527
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:16,870
certain security protocols and this

528
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:18,820
could clearly could include rpki

529
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,100
so we would actually say in a much

530
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,500
broader level there is a conversation

531
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,959
that needs to happen here that about

532
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,180
whether within your own organizations

533
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,980
whether we can solve the collective

534
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:31,660
action problem not just by having

535
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,580
government procurement requirements but

536
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,140
by having people operators require from

537
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:37,689
their partners that they adhere to

538
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,550
certain things and the other thing is

539
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,440
just to go back to the conversation the

540
00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:43,090
last point I'll make is to go back to

541
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,030
the conversation we had on Wednesday on

542
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:48,790
Sunday a lot of it is not about law it's

543
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:51,190
about operational practices there have

544
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,860
to be properly deployments

545
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:56,440
there have been outages of rpki

546
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:58,540
repositories so having proper planned

547
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,460
that they I don't we all know I don't

548
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,950
care how many nines you put on your

549
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,440
reliability there will be outages the

550
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:07,720
nothing works perfectly and so there has

551
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,480
to be proper or procedures designed for

552
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,420
failover that has to be done robustly

553
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,950
and in fact these practices exist but

554
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,490
also you know getting better information

555
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,530
about availability response times

556
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,450
practices this is something you this

557
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,040
entire community is familiar with every

558
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,230
time you've deployed a new technology

559
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,909
there is a learning process by which you

560
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:29,680
understand what the real requirements

561
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,720
are and the kinds of information and

562
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,670
which is critical and I was encouraged

563
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,710
that on Sunday but we really began to

564
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,150
see is the beginnings of that discussion

565
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,960
and hopefully that will robustly

566
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:42,220
continue on in the future so the I did

567
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,260
this is basically what we're talking

568
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,910
about there is among other major sets of

569
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:47,470
recommendations that we talked about but

570
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,930
we spent most of the time at the last

571
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,360
night on talking about decoupling the

572
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,890
question of signing the LRS a and the

573
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:56,439
acknowledgment of who the residual

574
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,700
rights holder to the IP addresses from

575
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,880
the question of rpki

576
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:03,610
we made recommendations on that and they

577
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,830
are currently for you to read in the

578
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:08,860
document so our reaction is yes to

579
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,689
summarize is the ability to distribute

580
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:13,120
the validators with all five towels

581
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,070
would be a huge breakthrough there seem

582
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,540
to be some encouraging signs that some

583
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:18,159
of the recommendations we're making may

584
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,240
have the ability to crack

585
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:25,270
that not the ability to adopt the RP a

586
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,700
possibly by substituent as is disclaimer

587
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,040
of warranties to permit machine readable

588
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,350
use of RP care information in

589
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,300
appropriate circumstances and really

590
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:37,120
thinking about the non-member services

591
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,520
pathway that ripe uses to separate the

592
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,179
rpki issuance from actually the

593
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,530
acknowledgement of some the RS a the new

594
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:46,810
nonprofit is a discussion I would

595
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,360
encourage us to have and in fact I would

596
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,980
my hope is that conversations like the

597
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,750
one we had last Sunday will continue

598
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,150
where the community can talk about

599
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,290
practices educate themselves come to an

600
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,570
understanding of how that's going to

601
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:00,520
function but most importantly is to keep

602
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,110
the momentum going I know many people

603
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,210
have commented this has been discussed

604
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,219
for many years without seeming to move

605
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,990
forward it seems like this is a moment

606
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,760
where this really could make that kind

607
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,950
of critical breakthrough and I hope that

608
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,510
we've been part of pushing it there and

609
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,610
I encourage the entire community to

610
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:27,510
continue in that same direction thank

611
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:27,510
you there's any questions

612
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:36,270
mappy tank I do thank you for that

613
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:38,370
the push for putting it in requirements

614
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:41,910
I think really is where the rubber meets

615
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:44,790
the road in terms of money drives

616
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,810
efforts as much as we don't like we'd

617
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,820
like to think we're making a great

618
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:49,020
community something's got to keep the

619
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:51,710
machine running and that's the money

620
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,360
coming in so if we can put these in as

621
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:56,400
requirements I think we're gonna see a

622
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,320
lot more movement happening on this I

623
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,040
really probably applaud your efforts on

624
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,689
this love what you're doing at this

625
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,790
thank you so much this is really opening

626
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,180
my eyes to a lot of the legal challenges

627
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:12,510
here thank you terrific thank you yes

628
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:14,670
John Curran Arin of course we're in

629
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:17,160
receipt or of this report and I'd like

630
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:20,100
to just thank Chris and his team from

631
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,410
UPenn we did spend quite a bit of time

632
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:24,149
talking to them to make sure we were all

633
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:26,790
inline about what the issues were and

634
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,120
how they flowed into the resulting

635
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:32,000
agreements Aaron takes it very seriously

636
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:35,040
we've looked at the report the board

637
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,560
directed a risk review a whole review of

638
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:39,810
the report its recommendations the risk

639
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,820
profile that we have on the service and

640
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:44,190
what can be accommodated in these

641
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:46,169
recommendations will be doing that now

642
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,720
it's going to take a while because it's

643
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,790
a pretty complicated issue but we will

644
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,150
be in April at the April iEARN meeting

645
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:55,440
providing a update where where we are if

646
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:56,070
there's anything that's low-hanging

647
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,350
fruit

648
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:01,050
we'll try to get that out and make

649
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,730
additional changes as we already have I

650
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,919
do expect the UPenn folks should be

651
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:06,390
there someone will be there to also

652
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,100
present to the Aaron membership and

653
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,260
we'll talk through some of these

654
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,209
alternatives at that meeting if you're

655
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,940
not at the iron meeting please

656
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:16,350
definitely jump in remotely because by

657
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,300
then we'll have the first readout from

658
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,030
Aaron as to which of these we can look

659
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,520
at and which ones might be harder to do

660
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:25,649
one more thing is that we predominantly

661
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,600
worry about the risk this is a service

662
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,150
it's not really a software it's not a

663
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,790
piece of open source it's because people

664
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:35,880
are accessing a real-time service to the

665
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:39,060
extent that this service is used as a

666
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,110
way of providing additional security for

667
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,629
the routings

668
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:44,010
so it's truly optional might not be

669
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:46,050
there might not be available at one

670
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:47,550
point Aaron actually has very few

671
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,950
worries about that we know how to run

672
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:52,320
high availability systems the concern is

673
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:55,770
about how many operators turn this on

674
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,350
and don't properly do routing validation

675
00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,210
and rely on this in a way that if the

676
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,399
service is unavailable they do an

677
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,690
operational impact and so we need to

678
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,870
have a lot of discussion about that in

679
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:08,760
the community we did have some on Sunday

680
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:11,489
but we're really worried about the

681
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,320
misuse of the service and what happens

682
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,820
when it's not around not the

683
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,710
availability of the service the

684
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:17,970
availability of service we understand we

685
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,890
have a responsibility to keep it up and

686
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:21,540
running part of the dialogue is also

687
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,700
realized we have to get more information

688
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,620
out there about expectations and

689
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,560
availability so people know what the

690
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:31,020
service commitment is but really people

691
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:33,270
think hard about whether or not we can

692
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,340
live with the rpi service being our PGI

693
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,070
services see a service turning off

694
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:41,310
because if we can then there's a much

695
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:43,800
lower risk profile if it can be down for

696
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,450
four hours or six hours and that's what

697
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,510
you need to think about because it's the

698
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:51,360
risk of misuse people who are impacted

699
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,640
who shouldn't be that it's driven the

700
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,050
legal protection framework all right

701
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,330
I look forward everyone in April are

702
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:59,040
participating in this thank you well

703
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:00,389
thank you John I think that aaron has

704
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,670
been incredibly constructive in this

705
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,440
process I think you appreciate the

706
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,020
seriousness with considering the

707
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,360
recommendations though I really want to

708
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:11,010
emphasize the meeting on Sunday involved

709
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,770
not just Aaron but representatives from

710
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:15,780
AP Nick and write a lot of those

711
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,910
operational questions are not are not

712
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,920
Aaron specific this is a general

713
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:21,780
community of the support that you're

714
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:24,180
going to receive from the towels from

715
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,290
all the other IRS and so I found that

716
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,640
the broader discussion about

717
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:28,290
expectations was actually

718
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,910
extraordinarily helpful and important

719
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,620
and thank you for also reminding me we

720
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,410
are a team David wish Nick who helped

721
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:36,899
took the lead in our much of the work

722
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,790
being done here is in attendance and is

723
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,190
here to answer any questions that may

724
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,770
come up on that side as well please hi

725
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,030
could you go back to your recommendation

726
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,070
number six please

727
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:48,910
is it possible yeah there you there you

728
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,830
go this is

729
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,660
I think one of the most important points

730
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,490
that we need to bring out the the two

731
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:58,180
most effective security tools I found

732
00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:01,810
over the years are the AUP and the RFP

733
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,730
in particular and this is something that

734
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,190
everybody in this room everybody who is

735
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:07,930
listening remotely you can go back and

736
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:10,780
you can actually engage in demand

737
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:13,540
generation with your customers to

738
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:16,210
explain to them why they should be going

739
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:18,370
to their providers and including your

740
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:21,970
own organization if you you're their

741
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:24,189
providers and demanding that manners be

742
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,960
adopted that rpki

743
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,080
be adopted that it be put as a

744
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,840
requirement into the RFP that has the

745
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,939
effect of you know attaching revenue to

746
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,730
adoption of these technologies and it

747
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,370
also means that as they become more

748
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,910
prevalent we then see a perceived

749
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,790
normalization of risk which helps

750
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:47,830
lawyers it attorneys in the legal sphere

751
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:50,379
having making more accurate assessment

752
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:53,740
of the actual risks versus you know a

753
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:56,920
very abstract risk profile which we just

754
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:59,380
heard about with the previous commenter

755
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:01,630
thank you well I think that's absolutely

756
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:03,100
true the procurement can be hard as a

757
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,660
requirement it can be a scoring

758
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:06,490
criterion that's a soft requirement

759
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,530
there's a lot of different ways to build

760
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:10,750
it in and especially because something

761
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:13,750
like this which is actually by text

762
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:15,460
standards fairly cheap it's an

763
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:16,990
interesting idea to if it gives you a

764
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,640
greater likelihood to get business if

765
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,170
not a hard requirement that itself can

766
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,000
make a huge amount of difference I

767
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:24,130
actually think we owe a huge debt of

768
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,050
thanks to 18t for turning on the service

769
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,700
because we actually it's not just

770
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:29,560
lawyers but insurers and the other

771
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,320
essential parts of the business process

772
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,970
need data and in fact I'm glad that

773
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,050
Nimrod is gonna give his lightning talk

774
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:37,120
cuz he's gonna share with us a little

775
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:38,919
bit of their experience and we'll find

776
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,510
out exactly be able to get our minds

777
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,490
around what the size of that risk is in

778
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:44,170
ways that someone had to be first and

779
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,250
take that step and I'm just grateful to

780
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:49,020
them for doing it because I think that

781
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:52,960
we all are the beneficiaries of that we

782
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:57,420
don't Unicom Chris and David thanks a

783
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:02,250
lot it's really opening the perspective

784
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:06,210
at the air in space actually may get

785
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:08,520
full use and the benefits of secure

786
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:13,920
routing are not withheld from their

787
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:16,410
members for John I would have a question

788
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,540
when you say you want to turn off the

789
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:21,380
service for four hours is it just is it

790
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:24,540
just making the repository server

791
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:33,630
unavailable or is it well ok for four

792
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:35,190
hours everything gets invented so is it

793
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:36,840
it's an interesting question that we

794
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:39,570
have about failover based on the

795
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,909
unavailability you know proper caching

796
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:44,639
requirements in the prior in practices

797
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:47,640
make sense but you know to amplify on

798
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,810
something I said last time there are one

799
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,390
of the leaders of this and for example

800
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:54,090
have been the internet exchange points

801
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:57,660
in Europe who have begin treating routes

802
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:00,629
unsigned routes as invalid which is a

803
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:02,430
big step unless there's an it's sorry

804
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,870
they've changed the default policy

805
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,490
you'll have to get the details from

806
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:07,469
someone who knows this better but to

807
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,240
make a more active deployment of rpki

808
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:11,340
unless there's a specific opt-out and

809
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,930
you start to see things like this where

810
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,939
you see broader parts of the community

811
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:17,610
starting to put greater pressure on

812
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,460
other parts to begin to deploy rpki and

813
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,080
i think that is how people who are

814
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,580
interested in great and creating greater

815
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,429
security can work together to create

816
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,659
that kind of collective dynamic that can

817
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,070
actually solve some of the problems that

818
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,930
have stopped the points so I would

819
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:33,330
encourage all of you to think about this

820
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,440
with your organization's as well as to

821
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,909
whether you should adopt it and the

822
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,530
kinds of things you can do working with

823
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,180
your partners to make sure that we make

824
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:42,350
the routing infrastructure as secure as

825
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,350
possible thank you

826
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,409
you
