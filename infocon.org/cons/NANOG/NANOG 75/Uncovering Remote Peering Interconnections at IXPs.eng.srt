1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:14,599
I welcome back

2
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:15,620
this time it's an entirely different

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:17,480
topic

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,640
it's about uncovering remote peering

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,400
interconnections that I expand let me

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,580
just briefly give you some motivation on

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,140
this topic so within the i-x community

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:32,479
there was a lot of discussion about

9
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:34,930
whether XP remote peering destroys like

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,870
some fundamentals of the internet and

11
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:41,180
yeah it's not meant to be there and I

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,968
don't want to go down this road today

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:46,760
but my thinking or the thinking of this

14
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,830
team of researchers from forth lancaster

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,099
university d clicks and m6 was actually

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:54,530
okay but before we can really argue

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,989
about this we need to understand what's

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,170
going on so actually how much remote

19
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:04,610
peering at IXPs can we find out there

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:07,909
and as we all understand what an eye

21
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:11,329
experience one of the main things I want

22
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:13,460
to highlight here again is it sort of or

23
00:01:11,329 --> 00:01:16,428
it should provide direct interconnection

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:19,100
among a ESS and keeps local traffic

25
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:22,219
local so at least if you look at public

26
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:25,249
references like Internet Society where

27
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:27,979
the benefits of internet exchange points

28
00:01:25,249 --> 00:01:31,490
are summarized those are the key points

29
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:36,079
right it reduces cost and it builds a

30
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:40,729
local internet community and building on

31
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:43,399
those fundamentals we also need to keep

32
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:46,130
an eye on the pressure in the market so

33
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,850
there's pressure for diversify appearing

34
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:52,639
so increasing volumes more pressure on

35
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:56,270
ISS for denser and more diverse peering

36
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:58,939
connections and fundament and thereby a

37
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,249
fundamental shift of peering practices

38
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:03,559
that is required right like the mental

39
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:05,539
model - 20 years ago was just yeah we

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,110
have transit and a bit of peering but

41
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:11,390
now all those big city ends are not

42
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:13,849
necessarily I experiment a lot of

43
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:19,579
peering and also a lot of IXP peering

44
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:22,310
and a very high-level definition of real

45
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:25,610
remote peering is when a network PSN it

46
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:28,730
XP without having physical presence

47
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,560
ixps infrastructure I mean I understand

48
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,810
it's way more complicated because what

49
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,420
is the i-x peace infrastructure if I

50
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:39,110
made a collocation on the same campus is

51
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:41,329
a remote or is it not remote and how is

52
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:43,730
the game with reseller so I could

53
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,160
connect for financial reasons

54
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,619
through a real reseller even though I'm

55
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,570
hosted in the same facility so it's a

56
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,550
whole lot of complexity we're facing if

57
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:56,750
we're asking the simple question how

58
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:59,030
much remote peering is out there so how

59
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,610
to peer remotely its connect to that

60
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,200
experience a brick without collocating

61
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,740
throughout server that's understood and

62
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,660
the main driver might be equipment

63
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,850
deployment operational cost so equipment

64
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:12,740
so you don't need multiple routers at

65
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,920
different locations and the Colo costs

66
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:19,310
and all this stuff and you can connect

67
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,769
through two multi multiple I access with

68
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,760
the same equipment with the same router

69
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:28,640
right so but the risk we're running into

70
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,640
is remote clearing cancels out a lot of

71
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,029
fundamental XP benefits so it introduces

72
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,369
third parties it reduces the resilience

73
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,850
and reliability so more complexity is

74
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:45,290
always reducing resilience and it might

75
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:48,890
increase latency so let me define the

76
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:51,170
goal for this research study and this

77
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,720
was what goes beyond this cable so we

78
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,030
saw that cable and this is plugged into

79
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,050
the isp platform but actually we have no

80
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:02,320
clue what's actually behind it so we

81
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,400
want to achieve more transparency as I

82
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,150
explained in the beginning of this talk

83
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:11,050
and identify remote and local peers from

84
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:15,380
an external view without using

85
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:17,930
proprietary XP data or using our

86
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,589
internal view so actually we just want

87
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,080
to use public available data sources and

88
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:26,450
this is beneficial for XP operators and

89
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,460
customer point of view as well because

90
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:31,880
as an IXP operator you don't necessarily

91
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:36,340
know whether someone is remote peer or

92
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,330
not because this is not in the

93
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:42,020
commercial model of the

94
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:44,628
to really have data on this and the

95
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:47,448
features of remote peering so what are

96
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:49,909
the characteristic compared to local

97
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:52,000
peering and the ultimate question which

98
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:54,979
eventually was not answered in this

99
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,960
research study but needs a follow-up is

100
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:00,378
what are the implications on the

101
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,150
resilience of the ecosystem so let's

102
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:06,319
quickly have a look at the state of the

103
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:09,080
art so today we just have some very

104
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,479
fundamental work which only focus on the

105
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,909
RTT based remote peering inference so

106
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:17,780
they just detect remote earrings based

107
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:21,500
on RTT measurements and this can be done

108
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,650
some iyx peace offer trace routes or

109
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,389
pings through the looking-glass and this

110
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,448
is within the fabric or very close to

111
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,699
the fabric and that yeah that's how they

112
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:35,659
measure they use those to really infer

113
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:38,360
RTT based local or remote earrings and

114
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:41,120
they just defined a value and said

115
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:43,069
everything with the higher latency than

116
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,750
10 milliseconds is an indication for

117
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,419
remote Peter and then we assume it's a

118
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:51,409
remote peering it's a conservative fresh

119
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,448
hold for local regional ixps because for

120
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:54,919
local this might be true for regional it

121
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:57,529
might be complicated if there are

122
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,279
multiple facilities within the same set

123
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:04,310
city and the same layer to fabric but we

124
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:06,710
will now get into this to more detail so

125
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:09,949
to begin with we have a validation data

126
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,620
set to get some sense of at what we are

127
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:15,979
actually looking so and with this

128
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,960
regional IXPs data set we could see that

129
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:21,818
40 percent of the remote peers actually

130
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,758
have RTT lower than 10 milliseconds

131
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:30,770
however 80% of the remote peers have

132
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:33,110
less than 1 milliseconds RTT so it's not

133
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,560
as black and white as the previous study

134
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:40,009
has shown right so there are a lot of

135
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:42,099
local peers that actually have a higher

136
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:46,909
RTT and there are a lot of remotes that

137
00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:49,430
have a lower RTT however it gives us if

138
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:51,610
we look at the distribution it gives us

139
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,069
all a fairly good

140
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,650
tends to just have an overview of what's

141
00:06:54,069 --> 00:07:00,610
going on and if we focus on white area X

142
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:03,299
piece and have a heat map on the RTT

143
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,550
between the different ones we see that

144
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,310
87 percent of the facility pairs

145
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,669
actually have more than 10 milliseconds

146
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:15,539
Media an RTT and we used the data from

147
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:19,120
the net ix4 for this experiment and

148
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:21,219
roughly 14% of the i-x piece as of today

149
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,849
can be classified as white area X piece

150
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:28,529
meaning they cover not just one

151
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:32,469
metropolitan region but expanded beyond

152
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:35,379
so our methodology actually how it works

153
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:37,120
what we are building and we propose the

154
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:41,620
first principles approach to infer

155
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:44,379
remote peering and local peers so first

156
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:48,009
we want to take into account the port

157
00:07:44,379 --> 00:07:50,169
capacity because if I am an a s has a

158
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:52,330
very high port capacity at ni X it's

159
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,810
very unlikely that they actually remote

160
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:57,490
so if we talk about hundreds of gigabits

161
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,969
the assumption is that they can't be

162
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:04,509
remote the next assumption is we doing

163
00:08:00,969 --> 00:08:07,300
our TT measurements with ping and the

164
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:11,830
RTT value is provide some evidence how

165
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:15,900
far in XP is so the lowest ever of

166
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:20,080
observed our GT gives the indication of

167
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:22,000
the least or at least this distance is

168
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,050
guaranteed so it can be further way if

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,870
we consider a speed of light and then

170
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,229
colocation facilities so we know from a

171
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,870
previous study and public available data

172
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:39,189
which colocation facilities hosting

173
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:41,919
which networks and this gives us also a

174
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,920
good data foundation to understand how

175
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,550
far or were actually the equipment is

176
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:51,579
and we have my TX routers and as I

177
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:55,750
explained before one router multiple I

178
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:59,010
axis and of course there's a lot of

179
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:02,620
private connectivity over facilities

180
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:05,350
which is established without the X piece

181
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:08,040
being involved so

182
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:10,660
the algorithm we are proposing just

183
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,560
eventually does a very simple thing so

184
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,949
we get an appearance whether a pair of

185
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,880
an IX is remote local or we can't really

186
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:24,940
tell because the data we're seeing is

187
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,189
contradicting each other so the first

188
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,320
step in if we have a one of those

189
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:32,980
results well we stop the algorithm and

190
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,250
the first thing is we just focus on the

191
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:38,410
pot capacity from IXP websites and

192
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:41,170
peering DBU so we know that peering DP

193
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,750
is a rough indication and we know that

194
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:46,900
websites not always up to date but this

195
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:50,110
gives us at least some ground truth then

196
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:53,319
we infer the distance between IXP

197
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:57,810
members and facilities and that's how we

198
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:02,470
basically build from our vantage points

199
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:05,109
IXP RTT map which we use including the

200
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,330
facility information and for the

201
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,890
facility information we also have the

202
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:14,470
GPS locations where actually the

203
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:17,350
facilities are and correlated with the

204
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:22,620
RT T's we can really say the physical

205
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:26,260
distance and then fear on the latency so

206
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:28,750
the last step we localize the facility

207
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:32,590
level and the private connectivity so we

208
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:35,320
using as the step before but just with

209
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:39,820
the as2 facility mappings we doing trace

210
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:42,760
routing to see which yeah hopes we are

211
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:45,310
traversing and given the order and the

212
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,280
different facilities we can get a clue

213
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:51,520
where a network is sitting and thereby

214
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,810
whether it is a remote or local so does

215
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:56,500
it work

216
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:59,380
our first summarize results is that we

217
00:10:56,500 --> 00:11:01,660
don't really have a good coverage for

218
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,470
all the peers we are focusing on in

219
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:08,469
every data set so sometimes for example

220
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,500
with the port capacity we just have 11%

221
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:15,730
coverage however

222
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:18,330
this is a very precise metric because

223
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,370
it's coming from the network itself and

224
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,370
we didn't have any means to verify the

225
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:26,640
accuracy so overall we can say that the

226
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:29,480
coverage is 93 percent the position 95

227
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,959
and we can have accuracy of 94 percent

228
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:35,610
with the validation data sets so now the

229
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:37,649
question what are actually the results

230
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:43,170
um how does remote peering look in the

231
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:45,450
wild and first of all we want to explain

232
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,969
from the four steps I explained in the

233
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:50,160
algorithm before from which actually the

234
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,760
interference is coming and therefore we

235
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:59,189
are focusing on the top-30 IX piece from

236
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:02,189
three days in 2018 and on the on this

237
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,950
plot you can see like yeah as I said

238
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:08,250
which step of the algorithm actually and

239
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:11,190
feared that this is a local or remote

240
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:14,550
and 10% of the inference can made using

241
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:17,250
the only the port capacity RTT

242
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,170
colocation facilities and multi IX

243
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,940
modules account for the majority of the

244
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,569
interference that's the green part of

245
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:27,270
the plot and 25% of the multi I

246
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:31,680
experience connect to more than 10 IX

247
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:38,250
piece so the interference results so

248
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:41,069
here again a number of IX piece and yeah

249
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,040
the result so you see the orange part is

250
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:47,579
actually the number of local peers the

251
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:50,670
yellowish part is number of remote peers

252
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:53,310
and blue is we could not make inference

253
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:56,910
based on our algorithm so what we found

254
00:12:53,310 --> 00:13:01,560
is that one third of members peers peer

255
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:04,610
remotely with AI XP a 90% of the XPS

256
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:07,800
have at least 10% of their peers remote

257
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:12,839
but for the really large exp such as am

258
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:16,949
the XDK expose iyx ms k IX have 40% of

259
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:19,320
their peers remote and if we focus on

260
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:22,260
the cross rate therefore we looked at 5

261
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,250
IXPs where we had historical data and we

262
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:31,410
look at join and departure rates and we

263
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:35,490
see that actually twice as much

264
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:39,410
remote piers compared to local piers and

265
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:43,439
remote piers have a far higher join

266
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,689
versus departure rate so the assumption

267
00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:47,639
would be a bit that maybe you're more

268
00:13:45,689 --> 00:13:51,420
flexible with a remote peering and it's

269
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:54,029
easier to deep here or to access but we

270
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:58,679
also have a good number of peers that

271
00:13:54,029 --> 00:14:01,470
turn from remote piers to local piers so

272
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:03,600
or it could be an indication of a

273
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:06,389
saturation of the system right so

274
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,699
everyone in this metropolitan region or

275
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,939
who has or wants to establish a pop

276
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:14,969
there has it already and if you want a

277
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:17,639
small capacity and don't want to go into

278
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:23,459
this area then you rather do it by

279
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:24,869
remote clearing so this is actually

280
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:28,819
skipping it

281
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:31,619
remote peering routing implications so

282
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:34,439
actually we were a bit curious about the

283
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:38,129
past so we also did a traceroute

284
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:42,959
measurement study for remote piers it

285
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:45,990
was 318 members and actually was done at

286
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,839
Dax Frankfurt and we saw that 66% of the

287
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:51,870
cases the trace rods included the

288
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:56,970
closest iyx piece to the remote pier but

289
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:59,279
in 34% of the cases we do not comply

290
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,709
with the expected hot potato routing

291
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,389
exit strategy

292
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:05,699
however the hint is this is trace

293
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:07,920
routing and this can be considered as

294
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:11,579
crown truth right this is rather an

295
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,248
indication so we compile all the data

296
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:17,549
and all the stuff we have and build a

297
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:19,980
website to really visualize it please go

298
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:22,589
there and check it out however note this

299
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:25,949
is not the fastest website and I we

300
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:28,019
experienced some some load issues this

301
00:15:25,949 --> 00:15:32,189
morning already so maybe you check it

302
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:34,110
rather tomorrow tonight and yeah you can

303
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:37,529
play around with it you can check out

304
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:41,160
different XP facilities you can query

305
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:42,490
for different a SS and you it showed on

306
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,350
the map and

307
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,649
it also gives you an indication whether

308
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:50,920
it is likely to be a remote peer or

309
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:55,930
local peer and whether it's outside of

310
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:59,110
the RTT range or not so let me conclude

311
00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:01,810
the we built a new methodology to

312
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,660
accurately infer the peers connected to

313
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:07,089
XPS through remote peering and thereby

314
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,819
we try to increase the transparency of

315
00:16:07,089 --> 00:16:11,860
the peering ecosystem and illuminate

316
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:14,050
peering trends and practices so the

317
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,230
takeaway is a lot more remote peering

318
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:18,969
and faster growing than local peering

319
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:23,050
remote peering becomes popular practice

320
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:24,670
in almost everywhere and we made it

321
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,430
publicly available through our web

322
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:29,800
portal the remaining future work is to

323
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:34,989
really use those interferences to really

324
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:37,719
get some information on yeah how often

325
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:40,060
do the links fail or such things so if

326
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,430
it's increasing or decreasing the

327
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:45,040
resilience of the ecosystem internet and

328
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,260
also have an interpretation of traffic

329
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,349
levels right it might be that or it is

330
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:53,620
the case that it's a huge number of

331
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:57,430
remote peer set in XP but I'm sure

332
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:59,200
without having proven it that they know

333
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,969
the count or they cannot be accounted

334
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,589
for the majority of the traffic at the

335
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:09,189
XPS right so even though we see a lot of

336
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:11,079
remote peers are they that important if

337
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:15,130
we take the entire internet ecosystem

338
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:17,230
into consideration so thank you that's

339
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,170
it from my side and I'm happy to take

340
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:26,650
your questions

341
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:26,650

Camila Cardona from entity communication

343
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:37,540
hi so I'm one of the authors of the

344
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:41,440
previous study thank you for mentioning

345
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:43,570
the study so I have one comment there in

346
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,110
our defense what we wanted was to give a

347
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,659
low like a lower bound you know a lower

348
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:52,780
bounding in how much remote peering was

349
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,850
use and we wanted to reduce the number

350
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,610
of false positives and just I mean just

351
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:00,580
mention that I mean you did a very good

352
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:02,020
job in academia until Europe paper was

353
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,370
published no one knew about remote

354
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,900
curing when I talked about remote

355
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,780
peering they were like what are you

356
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:11,170
talking about so yeah you got it started

357
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:13,960
so thanks for that so just one question

358
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:16,810
when we did the study there was one

359
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,720
particular case in which one router in I

360
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:22,659
think in rush I think what's BK they

361
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:24,490
were they had it they had like nine

362
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:28,720
different remote viewing sessions from

363
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:30,100
the same router and we didn't look too

364
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,430
much into that but I don't know if you

365
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,679
have any any more of this type of

366
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:38,440
curiosities which I which I think is

367
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,080
well it's fun to know whether you some

368
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,180
more of these cases happening of you

369
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,240
know n number of sessions from the same

370
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:49,210
routers or stuff like this yeah so the

371
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,910
max we observed was 15 actually and it's

372
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,860
I wouldn't say commonplace but it's it's

373
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:59,100
not super rare so you can find it here

374
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,100
here and there and yeah it it happens

375
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:08,510
so I guess let it thank you so much have

376
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:08,510
a good afternoon

377
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,440
you
