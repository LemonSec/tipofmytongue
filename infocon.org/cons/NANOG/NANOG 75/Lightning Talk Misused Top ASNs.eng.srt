1
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:18,770
well we smoked in

2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:21,770
good evening everyone so I'm on rug I

3
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,200
work at hurricane electric and we

4
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,290
operate a global backbone all the

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,869
continents right now and I'd be talking

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,450
about miss you stop essence so as a part

7
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:33,890
of running a large network we do see

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,660
lots and lots of noise in the routing

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,890
table and this is just a quick front

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,660
talk about the misuse of s 1 2 & 3 and

11
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,989
the times we see them in the routing

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,209
table when we don't expect them to

13
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:49,640
so before Before we jump into that a

14
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,379
quick introduction who they are so s1 is

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,229
with level 3 communications that's

16
00:00:51,379 --> 00:00:57,620
CenturyLink now a s2 is University of

17
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:59,870
Columbia and s3 is MIT so except the s-1

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:02,390
other two are not a transit network

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:04,309
there are times when we see them as

20
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,940
transit networks in the routing table

21
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:11,000
and across various tools so how are they

22
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,560
misused well a lot of people just

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,810
copy-paste the simple prepend

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,820
configuration so none of configuration

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,310
just says prepend your s and you know

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,630
twice or thrice put 1 2 & 3 people just

27
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,730
copy-paste and put them in the router

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,940
and if you don't believe me I have some

29
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:29,270
sometimes to actually show that people

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:35,240
also write 1 2 or 3 in the in the in the

31
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:38,030
prepend rules and it just just happens

32
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,770
and there are a couple of other other

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,390
interesting patterns which I did not

34
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,950
cover in this talk but they are there

35
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,010
are patterns especially with the 4-byte

36
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:47,510
asn we were say you have a s and 1 2 3 4

37
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:49,460
and someone tries to write them four or

38
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:52,070
five times and accidentally misses one

39
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:55,339
of the digits so suddenly you see 1 2 3

40
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:59,389
4 1 2 3 4 1 2 4 and then 1 2 3 4 showing

41
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:01,550
showing fake petrels so why is it

42
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,100
important how exactly that impacts do we

43
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,720
really need to worry about it so that

44
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,970
shows one one part of it is it shows

45
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,669
unexpected relationship of the leaking

46
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,950
essence so that's on the tools like one

47
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:15,109
of our tools bgp dot h e dotnet as well

48
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,959
as say things like stat dot write dotnet

49
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:20,209
you'll just see crazy unexpected

50
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:22,280
relationship you'll see university of

51
00:02:20,209 --> 00:02:24,379
MIT suddenly popping up somewhere far

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,159
far away as as the transit provider of

53
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:27,159
some other network

54
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,609
it can be considered as s hijack and

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,190
it's bad for the for the trusted

56
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,050
Internet as we use it it can result in

57
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:38,329
announcement getting filtered if the

58
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,010
upstream provider or the peer of the of

59
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,110
the network is filtering based on the

60
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,269
air spots there is a high possibility of

61
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,190
getting it getting it filtered and it

62
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:49,400
can also result in broken connectivity

63
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,230
that these networks if they don't have a

64
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,000
default route whether they have a

65
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,099
default route or not and I don't really

66
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,170
know but it can always result in a

67
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,879
scenario where if they don't have any

68
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,420
default route there would be just no

69
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:06,500
connectivity with these actual networks

70
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:09,500
so here's the graph of of a s1 this was

71
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,230
taken around I think maybe three three

72
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:14,690
weeks ago this is from BGP dot H

73
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:17,268
Ethernet I'm not sure if you can read it

74
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,010
here it seems small but that that shows

75
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,319
this is just lots and lots of

76
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,810
relationships probably you'd be able to

77
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,208
see the list of the peers of s1 so

78
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:27,829
that's some network in Argentina then

79
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:29,840
there are a couple of networks in u.s.

80
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,730
this is one network in India then there

81
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,010
are a couple other networks in South

82
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:38,000
Africa it clearly shows something is is

83
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,519
wrong here so we go for the this

84
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,049
activity fun activity of hunting for the

85
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,410
leakers who are who are causing this

86
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:49,100
misuse we looked at the routing table

87
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,590
from ripe ras as well as Oregon route

88
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,380
used so you get the you get a reasonable

89
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,200
picture from from these terms this

90
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:58,940
analysis was done from 2015 to 18 I did

91
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,910
another talk in past where we did an

92
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,470
analysis up to 2015 so this was a kind

93
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,680
of version 2 for the talk just to see if

94
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,780
if something has changed we look for the

95
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,250
top 3 guesses which are appearing in the

96
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,889
air spot and we have a specific

97
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,180
algorithm to call it a leak or a non

98
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,180
leak I'll come to that in the next slide

99
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,190
we focus on the essence which are pre

100
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,930
pending so we shortlist the essence

101
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,490
which are propelling and the leaks which

102
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,860
are for less than 24 hours we don't

103
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:29,630
collect them because this is too much of

104
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,300
data if you if you start with that and

105
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,700
possibly it's it's I think it can be

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,470
done but that's just add a lot of data

107
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,620
set if if you want to add it for less

108
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:40,520
than 24 hours there are multiple route

109
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,919
collectors

110
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,948
which do not share their images for less

111
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:49,310
than that so here's the algorithm we use

112
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:51,050
leak or legitimate so we look further we

113
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,669
look for the cases where these in

114
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,800
essence are appearing and they have

115
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:58,219
absolutely no relation with the

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,889
adjacency so if you have someone say in

117
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,440
South Africa or Argentina or the cases

118
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:05,840
as I just came up and they have

119
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,389
absolutely no organization wise relation

120
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,039
with the as1 we we consider it as one of

121
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:12,770
the one of the reasons our possible

122
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,169
reasons we look further we look for the

123
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:18,620
left side in the air spot which is the

124
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:20,389
upstream provider so if we see is far is

125
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,280
one two or three on the left side in the

126
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,620
air spot that is one of the one of the

127
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,590
interesting cases we also look for the

128
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,810
cases where there is a less specific

129
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,869
origination from a prefix and a more

130
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,360
specific from a s one like this example

131
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:39,139
you see s one suddenly originating a

132
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,690
prefix in slash 24 while the slash 20

133
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:43,880
equivalent for that the superset of that

134
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:45,710
is being originated by someone else and

135
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,659
this someone else happens to be the

136
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:53,030
adjacency for a s 1 there are many cases

137
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:55,400
for 4 1 2 & 3 in the similar pattern and

138
00:05:53,030 --> 00:06:00,559
we as we assume that all these are the

139
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,419
leaks probably misuse of the ASM just a

140
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,259
quick list of some of the networks which

141
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:09,229
leaked is 1 2 & 3 is this list of s

142
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:11,419
numbers the interesting part here is the

143
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,159
amount of time so you can see some of

144
00:06:11,419 --> 00:06:15,380
the knickers have been doing this for as

145
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:17,539
long as four to five years you have one

146
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,180
four six zero days leak is still going

147
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:21,440
on I think this was this was the top one

148
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,719
is the case which is still there in the

149
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,630
routing table probably top three are

150
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:30,250
still there for while others were there

151
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:33,319
for probably you know little over India

152
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,270
same thing for four is too close to

153
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:39,069
three years for the top one still there

154
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:42,198
Friday so now increase it a little more

155
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:44,300
in for s 3 I'm not going to say more on

156
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,569
this on this slide because lightning

157
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,520
dogging was try to stick with that

158
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,080
here's the is the visibility into in

159
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,780
terms of graphs so these were the

160
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:55,990
networks which were leaking

161
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:57,520
guess one two and three all combined for

162
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,960
really long time so you can see some of

163
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,090
them have been doing it for a very long

164
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,710
time while other is still close to any

165
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,219
or at least four for this kind of data

166
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:09,239
for top top ten here comes the most

167
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:12,130
amusing s part you might have ever seen

168
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,200
this is the one of the leak which

169
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:20,110
suddenly created adjacent seas between

170
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:22,150
s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 and we just we just

171
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,100
found it in the dumps because we were

172
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:26,440
looking at 1 2 & 3 & suddenly notices

173
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,169
it's there so someone trying to probably

174
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:31,719
s1 six months for trying to prepend it

175
00:07:29,169 --> 00:07:34,030
and they wrote their a s and five times

176
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,410
and after that they just wrote 1 2 3 4 &

177
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:41,469
5 & just announce it in the routing

178
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:43,060
table so just this quick info on

179
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:44,860
anything such leaks so if you are if you

180
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,780
are prepending just copy paste specially

181
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:48,729
for the 4 by d essence don't don't start

182
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,650
typing your s in by hand if you have

183
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:57,849
just joined the organization and don't

184
00:07:50,650 --> 00:08:00,609
remember us and will avoid you know try

185
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,820
try try to try to generate config you

186
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,280
know by by using tools like BGP q3 that

187
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,080
surely helps if you're running an

188
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,090
internet exchange and this is this is

189
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,280
one of the cool parts which which is of

190
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,409
high interest now there are very good

191
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,719
tools like ixb manager and a route

192
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,490
server using which you can generate

193
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,340
configuration for your out server so if

194
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:22,570
you are it an exchange you can generate

195
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,729
config automatically and make sure that

196
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,400
such cases never propagate beyond your

197
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:30,460
out server and most of those auto

198
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:32,260
generation besides including the prefix

199
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,819
filter does includes the a s pass filter

200
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,880
as well in that that's significantly

201
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,530
reduces the noise and of course we

202
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,179
encourage the use of our PK that should

203
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,098
that should significantly help it was

204
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:46,839
great to hear yesterday from AT&T about

205
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:48,700
it just sample config if someone

206
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,780
accidentally accidentally lens on it

207
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,780
this is how you should prevent

208
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,790
references so Oregon route news for

209
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,310
providing the dumps ripe our ideas for

210
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,500
the dumps our toolkit which is BGP wrote

211
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:03,550
a chi dotnet and then the BGP dump tool

212
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,160
which is from

213
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,620
from rape it works very well although we

214
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,350
are trying to also use the ISIL Aereo's

215
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,760
open-source tool which is BG BGP scanner

216
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,770
which which seems to be much faster than

217
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,340
me to be dumped these days that's about

218
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:17,340
it thank you

219
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,289
[Applause]

220
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,489
you
