1
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:15,280
everyone well in this talk I would like

2
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,280
to touch upon

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,369
I security and in particular out

4
00:00:17,939 --> 00:00:22,560
insecurities hard in highly

5
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,320
decentralized system like the internet

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,710
but also present an approach as a

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,410
potential way forward

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,320
what BGP is insecure in a sense that it

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,660
doesn't have built-in mechanism to allow

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,690
one book to validate announcement it

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,980
gets from its neighbors one and a half

12
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:46,620
year ago I think BGP security extensions

13
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,440
were standardized in the IETF but it

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,339
will take quite some time before we see

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,720
them deployed already today though with

16
00:00:53,340 --> 00:01:01,020
the tools we have we can I think make

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,360
significant improvements in in the state

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:07,460
of the routing security to make it

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:11,490
happen other things need to take place

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:14,100
one of them is data and no matter what

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,619
kind of tools you are using I think you

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,830
need the data that authoritative least

23
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,630
aid the intention of intention authority

24
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,030
of a network turn on certain prefixes

25
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,710
this data at the moment is incomplete

26
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:32,000
and incorrect to certain extent but more

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:35,009
challenging thing is are in incentives

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,460
routing security is as technological a

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:42,119
sushi economic problem

30
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,158
moral hazard information asymmetry those

31
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,960
economic phenomena they hinder

32
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,990
deployment of security technologies

33
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,439
right like rousing security and unless

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,750
we invent or find out incentives why

35
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,839
operators should employ those controls I

36
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,049
think we can expect much progress in

37
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,909
this area but what is also missing on

38
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,820
this picture is this overlap between

39
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,129
these three circles the overlap we're

40
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,269
trying to make bigger and this overlap

41
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:15,030
is action because because without this

42
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:18,140
action by network operators nothing will

43
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,879
really help happen in this world so

44
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,940
before I go into this action thing let

45
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,489
me talk a little bit about the problem

46
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:29,210
so according to a great public service

47
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,920
called BGP stream that displays some

48
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:34,730
data about routing incidents on the

49
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,809
internet global him last year in 2018

50
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:41,780
about 13,000 incident happened 40% of

51
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:46,400
them almost 40% of them or routing

52
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:50,960
security attacks or incidents like route

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,310
hijack or rat League but 4.4 percent of

54
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,480
all the tournament systems on the

55
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,710
internet were affected by those

56
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:01,220
incidents almost 3000 determiners

57
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:05,000
systems are fell victim to one of those

58
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:07,520
attacks and 1300 networks were

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,390
responsible for about 5,000 browsing

60
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:14,390
incidents over a year so I think that

61
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:16,399
says there is a problem I did a similar

62
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,910
presentation last year and we look back

63
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:23,450
in 2017 and while looking at the

64
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:26,200
carriers that you know this routing view

65
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,959
and detection of those incident presents

66
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,060
one thing that I thought that if we

67
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:36,170
apply the same methodology again and

68
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:39,170
again while absolute numbers and numbers

69
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:41,299
are not may not be absolutely accurate I

70
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:43,700
think we can get a much more accurate

71
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,760
picture about the trend how the system

72
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:51,079
evolves so that's what I did I looked at

73
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,810
the same at the data in 2008 in applying

74
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,670
the same methodology and here's what I

75
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,770
got

76
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:00,470
well I think it's a positive thing we

77
00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:02,390
see those arrows going down meaning that

78
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,750
we have reduced almost ten percent

79
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,980
reduction in number of incidents 17

80
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:14,380
percent reduction in number of culprits

81
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:18,339
12 percent of victims and about 1% less

82
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,339
attendant systems who are affected

83
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:22,760
interesting enough that distribution

84
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,510
between outages and routing incident

85
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:30,320
remains stable just an observation

86
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:32,450
but I think while what - two points do

87
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,610
not represent trends so it's hard to say

88
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:36,890
well it's a long going trend and we

89
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,860
should expect this to continue or there

90
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:41,419
is just one off what is clear from

91
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,950
absolute numbers that

92
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:47,840
the problem still exists I think that

93
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:49,729
that's too early to arrest let's zoom a

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,810
little bit into this data so if we talk

95
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:58,910
about victim u.s. leads lowliest was

96
00:04:53,810 --> 00:05:03,230
about 600 networks implicated while

97
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:06,710
being victims of 1200 incidents they are

98
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:09,530
followed by Brazil Russia and Bangladesh

99
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,599
but absolute numbers they not tell the

100
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,039
full story of course because while some

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,050
countries have more networks operating

102
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,120
there some countries have elapsed so if

103
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,710
you normalize this data by number of

104
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,200
networks announced in the country

105
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:25,370
the picture is slightly different and we

106
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:27,650
see that Bangladesh mainland China and

107
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,900
Hong Kong leading the list was almost up

108
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:32,179
to 30% of all networks in the country

109
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,409
affected by routing incident which is

110
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,260
pretty high the name it still is

111
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,790
positive well part of Bangladesh in

112
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,860
China we see in other countries

113
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:46,190
reduction and those are two top 10

114
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,040
countries that I identified in 2017

115
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:51,590
routing analogies so you can see that in

116
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:54,020
all of the countries there's a decrease

117
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:58,669
in number of victims in particular can

118
00:05:54,020 --> 00:06:02,479
see Brazil and India be formed quite

119
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:04,970
well in this respect moving to culprits

120
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,000
on a country level you can see that

121
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:11,240
mainland China and Hong Kong again are

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,800
leading the list of culprits but if we

123
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:16,850
look at the regional level and that's

124
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,530
the right right chart Micronesia all

125
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,290
these beliefs but they only have one

126
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:24,739
network one culprit out of 20 networks

127
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:28,540
operating in in this region other than

128
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:31,730
that it's eastern Asia southeastern Asia

129
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:35,330
and Latin American Caribbean that are

130
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:37,940
have more more culprits from three to

131
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:43,580
four percent of all networks cause the

132
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:45,650
routing incident in that region again

133
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:50,060
genomics is very positive if you look at

134
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:52,989
Brazil if you look at Indonesia it's

135
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,759
it's great reduction of

136
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:58,300
number of networks that caused an

137
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,460
incident almost twice that's very good

138
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,710
dynamics so let's come back to this

139
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:05,020
graph that I presented first and let's

140
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,210
talk about this action because all these

141
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,940
three circles they're really enables of

142
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,489
this action and what is missing in this

143
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,500
section is a concerted action by by many

144
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,870
because only when many networks take

145
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:20,139
this action we can see significant

146
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:22,479
improvements in the routing system so

147
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:25,030
let's look who can take the section and

148
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:28,870
well I classify the networks into sort

149
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,479
of four buckets its age and access

150
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:35,110
networks its transit providers content

151
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:37,030
cloud and internet exchange points let

152
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:41,020
me go one by one and see what this

153
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:43,929
networks can do in fact to improve the

154
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,240
situation the edge I think for the edge

155
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:49,270
network which is an enterprise or access

156
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,130
network situation is pretty straight

157
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:55,240
forward because ultimately H Network

158
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:58,599
knows what prefixes they operate what

159
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:00,159
networks they operate so implementing

160
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:02,020
egress controls should be pretty

161
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:03,940
straightforward unfortunately this is

162
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,539
not always done because I think people

163
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,550
think what could possibly go wrong here

164
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,110
now a situation becomes more messy if H

165
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:13,210
network is multi-home because it's very

166
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,190
easy to become a transit provider of a

167
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:17,198
sudden and create a route lake which can

168
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:22,479
cause damage not only for network itself

169
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,370
but for for surrounding environment of

170
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,080
course H Network can register routing

171
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,610
information they intend because they

172
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:32,708
operate the own this address space so

173
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:34,539
that will enable relying party other

174
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:38,199
networks to validate reducing the risk

175
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:40,360
of routing incidents and hijacks and I

176
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,570
think for H network it's much better to

177
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,820
partner with security with a

178
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,100
connectivity provider that understands

179
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,260
routing security that implements routing

180
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,410
controls they will not only protect the

181
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:55,450
network from its own mistakes but also

182
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,550
protect from mistakes of other customers

183
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,990
for instance if other customer creates

184
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:05,109
loud click that will affect this network

185
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:06,700
the transit well job Snider's besides an

186
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:10,320
old Dutch proverb

187
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:13,060
once men into a BGP out is another man's

188
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,240
EBG p.m. well that's exactly where

189
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:19,089
transit can help it's another line of

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:24,130
defense that can compensate for whatever

191
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:27,070
mistakes and HHH Network has done there

192
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:29,530
is a business case for transit to enable

193
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:32,890
filtering and not allow an H to announce

194
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:37,959
more than the H operates again round

195
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:39,880
leaks there were many cases where routed

196
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,900
Lee called significant damage for

197
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,850
transit networks and its customers and

198
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,079
ensure correctness of this routing

199
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,720
information that can be challenging

200
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:52,660
given the tools we are using especially

201
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,300
if you're using IR IR are also the

202
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,400
challenging in semantics semantics is

203
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,709
not always clear for instance I have

204
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,449
said people document in I said all kinds

205
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:03,640
of things not necessarily their customer

206
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,070
cones and that caused us a bit of

207
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:10,840
trouble also when we talk about transit

208
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,420
it's it's it's clear that the high the

209
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,270
top tier of the transit provider is the

210
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:21,400
more difficult it is to enable more

211
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:23,860
accurate controls content and cloud they

212
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,360
have vast peering relationships for them

213
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,240
it's very important that they implement

214
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,830
egress filtering ingress filtering the

215
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,630
business case for ingress filtering is

216
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:34,750
less clear

217
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,910
however if provider has external

218
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:39,610
dependencies those dependencies may be

219
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:42,819
subject for hijacking and for instance

220
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:44,560
route route 53 the gold is this incident

221
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:49,000
was discussed in previous presentation

222
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,839
that's a clear case why content cloud

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,060
should implement ingress filtering of

224
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:56,650
course would be great if content can

225
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:58,839
register their routing information for

226
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:02,170
the same reason that H networks should

227
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:06,850
do that to enable others to the home

228
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:09,849
route validation from content finally

229
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:14,110
exchange exchange is in a great position

230
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,410
to significantly improve routing hygiene

231
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,850
in multi little pairings many exchanges

232
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,819
run facility which is called route

233
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,010
server

234
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,510
implementing whitelist filtering on the

235
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:25,819
route server can significantly improve

236
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:28,189
routing security in this environment

237
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,460
creating safe neighborhood but also

238
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:34,360
enabling sort of sense of collective

239
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,360
security and collective responsibility

240
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:42,230
so I hope this sort of shoot to indicate

241
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,980
that already with some simple actions

242
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,990
those actors can make a difference so

243
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,980
each player can contribute to the

244
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:54,020
routing security I think if you ask a

245
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,880
network would net will prefer a more

246
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:58,069
safe environment they operate of course

247
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:59,950
the answer is yes but most of these

248
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:02,600
networks they have little incentive

249
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,490
because if you look strictly at the

250
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,700
situation that security of your network

251
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,190
is not only your task it's also task of

252
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,080
other networks in the Internet to secure

253
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:14,630
your own network which is sort of you

254
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:17,330
know a bit of a disconnect and lack of

255
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,910
incentive so if you look at this list I

256
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:23,660
think we have what is in social science

257
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:26,060
called a collective action problem and a

258
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:27,319
collective action problem is a situation

259
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:29,810
which is less of an issue when you have

260
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,300
a small community when you sort of can't

261
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:34,430
agree quite easily but while community

262
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,260
grows bigger while there is a disconnect

263
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,630
communication disconnect in particular

264
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,970
then the conflicting interest of

265
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,770
participating parties do not allow them

266
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:48,680
to collaborate despite the common

267
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:51,350
benefit so one of the solution to

268
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,770
collective action problem is the norms

269
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:58,570
and the norms is something that is based

270
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:01,340
on common values that is supported by

271
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:04,970
certain behaviors and then we translate

272
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:07,460
this into routing space I think the

273
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,310
common value is pretty clear we all

274
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:12,740
would like to have a real in a secure

275
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:15,560
global routing system and we know the

276
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,770
behaviors I mean those sort of actions I

277
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:21,170
didn't tell you anything new I'm sure

278
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,660
those sort of behaviors they're pretty

279
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:26,079
undisputed right although not widely

280
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,079
deployed

281
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:34,449
but behaviors they're not gnomes right

282
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,280
so it takes some effort more maybe not

283
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,200
some but significant effort to move

284
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,300
those behaviors to know what has to

285
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:43,590
happen first of all they have to be

286
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:46,780
while accepted as good practice right

287
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:49,150
they cannot be too high because then it

288
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:51,100
can we cannot expect why the adoption

289
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:54,100
but they shouldn't be too low because

290
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,170
then it makes no difference and what is

291
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,790
important it should be very visible who

292
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,030
actually sticks to those gnomes

293
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:07,510
who doesn't and that should be supported

294
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:10,920
by measurable measurable metrics so let

295
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:14,500
me just go and show you some possible

296
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,650
baselines for those plays that we just

297
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:20,140
discussed and see if it makes sense so

298
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:22,660
if you look at the operators those sort

299
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,060
of you know common behaviors that have

300
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,579
potential to become gnomes are filtering

301
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:30,160
filter your customer comb filter your

302
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,870
own announcements do not pollute the

303
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,230
global routing system was incorrect

304
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:38,380
routing information ng spoofing in cases

305
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:40,660
where it's lower risk please perform ng

306
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,660
spoofing do not allow traffic with

307
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,550
spoofed source IP addresses coordination

308
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,350
be open to Gordon a that others can

309
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,229
contact you if they need your help in

310
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,320
mitigating routing incident and global

311
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,660
validation which really talks about

312
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,120
register your routing information your

313
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,420
intent so others can make informed

314
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:04,470
decisions while they accepting

315
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,469
announcement originated from you

316
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,580
internet exchange points while I

317
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:12,490
mentioned route server and if internet

318
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,280
exchange point filters if I'm strict

319
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,850
filtering whitelisted filtering on the

320
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:22,630
route server only allows announcement

321
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:26,590
from their peers that are registered for

322
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:29,590
instance in IRR or RPI that will create

323
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:34,180
a much more high hygiene in this

324
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:37,000
environment promote this culture of

325
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,560
security promote those baselines among

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,389
the name

327
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:44,699
members that's that's a very effective

328
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:47,129
action and I say other things like

329
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,680
protecting peering platform facilitating

330
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:52,199
communication and supporting their

331
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,019
members with monitoring and debugging

332
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:58,229
tools those are I think reasonable and

333
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:59,939
useful actions if you look at the

334
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,360
content and this is work in progress

335
00:15:59,939 --> 00:16:04,620
again contact can do multiple things

336
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,449
first of all provide propagation

337
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:10,290
incorrect routing information both from

338
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:14,300
ingress and egress points of view and

339
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:16,740
she's proofing again communication

340
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:21,149
global validation registry information

341
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:22,680
in arousing repositories promote culture

342
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:25,019
of collective responsibility and

343
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,180
collective security and again support

344
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:32,220
peering partners with monitoring

345
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:34,498
debugging tools so I think this set of

346
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:37,139
actions may sound reasonable they are

347
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:41,519
tightly scoped they are optimized for

348
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:43,170
low risk and low cost of deployment they

349
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,589
also have community behind it that

350
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,500
suppose those actions adhere some

351
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:51,899
transparency in monitoring I think we

352
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:54,529
have a good foundation for those actions

353
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:56,670
to be moved into the space of norms and

354
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:58,050
that's what manners which stands for

355
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,309
mutually agreed norms for routing

356
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:04,260
security is about now n is very

357
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:06,270
important think we are there yet I think

358
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:08,359
we need to do some work here and that's

359
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:11,398
why I'm presenting it

360
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:13,438
so why join matters if the network

361
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:15,809
doesn't implement those controls I think

362
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,760
it's time to think about this and that

363
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:20,760
could be a good first step because it's

364
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,439
not a very high baseline to improve

365
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,689
rousing security in your network and

366
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:26,579
that has added value that brings

367
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:28,770
benefits immediately but that could be a

368
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:31,230
first step on a long trajectory of

369
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,240
improving routing security if the

370
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:35,580
network implements these controls I

371
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,130
think it's important that this network

372
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:40,168
stands behind and demonstrate that those

373
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,600
practices are not just paperwork a slide

374
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:46,440
where they have real deployments and

375
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:48,510
real networks that stand by building

376
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,490
community demonstrating that community

377
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:52,260
of network operators can address

378
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:55,440
challenging issues is extremely

379
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:57,929
important and that's why we ask people

380
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,300
to join manners and what we're not there

381
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:03,030
yet but I think Manas is taking momentum

382
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,399
and can be used as a competitive

383
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:09,928
differentiator in your sort of

384
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:13,080
partnering with other networks now is

385
00:18:09,929 --> 00:18:14,340
Manas taking off so this effort started

386
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,820
in 2014

387
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:21,480
November 2014 so it's more than four

388
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:25,678
years ago and you can see that over last

389
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,020
year really the level of awareness level

390
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,030
of interest and I think in general we

391
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,040
can see that interest to rousing

392
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,710
security has increased and this graph

393
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:40,379
shows some positive dynamics that we

394
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:42,900
would like to see being continued so

395
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:45,360
what are we doing to increase adoption

396
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,890
and when I say we it's not Internet

397
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,139
Society which is supporting this

398
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,600
initiative strongly but also the

399
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,559
community the malleus community that are

400
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,419
acting as ambassadors well one thing is

401
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,730
of course looking at the incentives

402
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,580
another thing is lowing variable

403
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,230
adoption and very reduction is for

404
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,149
instance and providing more gear

405
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,640
guidance and networks how to implement

406
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,530
those simple actions implementation

407
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,140
guide which is now a ripe document as

408
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,120
well is available for that based on this

409
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:17,190
guide we developed online modules where

410
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,590
people in interactive mode can sort of

411
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:22,320
you know learn or refresh their memory

412
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:24,030
how those actions can be implemented we

413
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,110
are releasing a hands-on lab which is

414
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:31,170
the online lab which allows a student or

415
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:33,600
a network engineer to sort of you know

416
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,480
clear slate network make this network

417
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,270
man is compliant ie implement those four

418
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,429
actions the network will be available

419
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:45,960
online and will run on platforms like

420
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:48,780
Cisco genuine mikrotik and we're working

421
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,460
with training partners trying to

422
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:52,139
incorporate this in their training

423
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,510
curricula for instance this lab can be

424
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:58,380
used as an exam and some of of the

425
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:01,020
training courses I talked about

426
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,309
transparency and measuring stuff I think

427
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,290
that's very important that's also very

428
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:06,300
important for the reputation of the

429
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:10,230
all effort because right now if you look

430
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:13,889
at man as you just see list of 130 and

431
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,920
networks that sort of stated that they

432
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:19,800
implement those actions in fact when a

433
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:22,380
network joins this initiative we perform

434
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:26,129
checks those checks are not sort of

435
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,170
publicly available and therefore we are

436
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:30,180
not completely transparent so this is

437
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:32,040
not the public knowledge I'm telling you

438
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,600
this but what we trying to do we are

439
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,840
trying to start measuring this stuff

440
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,540
we're trying to measuring level of Manas

441
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:42,090
readiness what we call of participating

442
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,920
and even not participating networks just

443
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,020
to see also the state of routing

444
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:48,810
security in the net Internet in general

445
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,540
and also being able to look at the

446
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:54,810
trends how the things are evolving our

447
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,899
efforts like manners have any impact on

448
00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:01,200
routing security so that's what we call

449
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,330
Menace Observatory and memory port which

450
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,670
provides more detailed information for

451
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,870
members and informing them of any

452
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:11,700
shortcomings they might have so this is

453
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,489
work in progress we are planning to

454
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,560
release quite soon the public version of

455
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,720
the Menace Observatory where people can

456
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,030
look at sort of how routing system is

457
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,300
involved and members will be able to

458
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:25,590
look how their networks are behaving

459
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,139
visibly their commitments that they

460
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,629
stated when they join this effort and we

461
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,130
hope that will also stimulate some

462
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:37,680
community to the walkin and interaction

463
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:40,290
so to finish my presentation I would

464
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,200
like to suggest a little poll if you

465
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:46,860
don't mind if you can go to this URL to

466
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,600
slide or go to slider calm your browser

467
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:53,250
and enter this code and there are only

468
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,770
two questions and they are very easy

469
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:59,330
questions multiple choice so nothing

470
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,330
it's not an exam

471
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,840
right

472
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:14,980
so how many people managed to get to the

473
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,980
slider okay

474
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:26,460
so here's a question so the approach the

475
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,459
Manas approach is really based on norms

476
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:31,800
right so what do you think do you think

477
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:34,230
norms are the solution to the Royalton

478
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,629
security problems or you think that

479
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,040
natural diffusion of technologies

480
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,160
whatever technologies developed in the

481
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:43,710
ITF right will solve the problem by

482
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:47,430
themselves or you think we need help

483
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:52,010
from I don't regulate this right to tell

484
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,010
us what to do and that's the solution

485
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,530
so see a certain competition between

486
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,530
natural diffusion and regulation

487
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:32,200
hariya Fort Dodge telecom one of the

488
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:35,850
problems with general problems with

489
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:42,190
polls is that the questions actually

490
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:46,000
frame the potential answers so if you

491
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:48,640
ask me that I'll say no natural

492
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:54,360
diffusion of security technology doesn't

493
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:59,100
happen but that doesn't mean that

494
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:03,219
security technology cannot be propagated

495
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:10,240
but is that something that requires

496
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:12,820
norms okay well then I take your point

497
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,490
rigor I understand this well here we try

498
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:17,470
try to contrast at least some possible

499
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,870
approaches right so we put the three

500
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:22,870
buckets one is moving through the norms

501
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:25,989
moving through whatever can support

502
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:28,629
diffusion of Technology and regulation

503
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:32,400
so I think that that's that's okay let's

504
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,400
move to another question thank you

505
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,270
so the question is what needs to happen

506
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:46,300
to really move those practices into

507
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:50,139
norms the approach I presented them in

508
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,690
today is we believe Manas or something

509
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,780
like manners where we incur all people

510
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:58,480
and create strong global reference which

511
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,090
can also be used by other efforts you

512
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,240
know other security efforts which may be

513
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:07,000
more comprehensive and more fundamental

514
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,740
but I think what is important is there

515
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,560
that's why the title of the presentation

516
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:13,480
considered action that we all act in the

517
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:15,760
same direction that we all align and

518
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,380
believe something simple like manners

519
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,379
can provide this global reference

520
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:30,458
let me do the devil's advocate again am

521
00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:34,559
as I am looking at the questions I would

522
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:39,339
say in my opinion the word strong

523
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:47,199
reference at manners is something that I

524
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:50,668
do not match well then I suggest you

525
00:25:47,199 --> 00:25:50,669
vote for your dreaming or something

526
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,720
okay folks thank you very much I think

527
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,158
in there it's interest of time I'll pull

528
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,830
this poll those three thoughts are very

529
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,100
useful thank you very much and if you

530
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:29,010
could switch back to the yeah next slide

531
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:32,370
I think that's the last slide and at the

532
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:34,679
bottom is a small video if you

533
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,178
I think the slides will be available I

534
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,549
mean please click watch this video

535
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:41,309
probably tells more and better than my

536
00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:44,770
presentation of hot manners and the more

537
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:50,820
sort of entertaining way thank you

538
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:53,908
[Applause]

539
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:56,399
happy tack great talk one challenge I

540
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:59,190
think we always face is that as a

541
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,459
community we're rather insular we aren't

542
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,470
the ones that really drive the resource

543
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,620
allocation within the companies the

544
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:09,899
consumers out there do with the ipv6

545
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,799
effort we actually had branding that

546
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:16,939
went on to boxes on CTE and there was a

547
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:19,710
public publicly visible campaign for

548
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:22,460
selecting device manufacturers that were

549
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,110
actually adopting the ipv6 standards

550
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,580
with this we're just talking amongst our

551
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,408
community but we're not the ones

552
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,059
spending the money we're not the ones

553
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:32,909
driving the machine have you thought

554
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:35,789
about having a public campaign that says

555
00:27:32,909 --> 00:27:38,580
hey don't select an ISP unless they've

556
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:40,769
adopted the manners methodologies here

557
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,629
unless they are manners compliant have

558
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,909
the little sticker on their website or

559
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,500
some other thing that says they are

560
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:49,679
acting in the benefit of the entire

561
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:51,360
community that's where the the drivers

562
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,460
for change are going to come from that's

563
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,370
where the the money impact is going to

564
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:58,409
come from it can't just be us engaging

565
00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:00,449
in a mental masturbation exercise here

566
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:03,299
as a community it has to be something

567
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:05,760
where the money flowing in really shifts

568
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,820
based on are you a good citizen of the

569
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,889
community or not so bring it outside the

570
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,230
group here make it publicly visible and

571
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:14,490
I think you're on to something so just

572
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:16,110
to quickly answer your question we

573
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:18,320
haven't started this campaign but what

574
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:22,279
we did a year ago I think

575
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,009
we contracted research analyst company

576
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,659
for qilin research to look at the

577
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:28,909
perception of sort of potential

578
00:28:26,659 --> 00:28:31,669
customers and they provide us on on

579
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:35,110
manners and the outcome of this research

580
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:37,610
was quite positive saying that the

581
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,990
consumer will buy consume I mean like

582
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:44,689
enterprises for instance consumers

583
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,009
objectives for connectivity security are

584
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,460
very much aligned with manners

585
00:28:46,009 --> 00:28:51,700
objectives right and therefore they were

586
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,320
even willing to pay more for

587
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,350
connectivity provider that supports

588
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,950
manners right now in reality for this to

589
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:02,990
happen and and 4-5-1 said well no one is

590
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,850
going to pay more but you may expect

591
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,799
less discounts in negotiations for

592
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:09,559
instance but they can certainly make it

593
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,379
an asking point in but it needs to

594
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,000
happen I think what we need to develop

595
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:16,610
manners as a trademark as a quality

596
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,740
model yes need to become stronger so the

597
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:20,928
efforts I showed also on the reputation

598
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,610
and visibility and transparency of this

599
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:25,700
effort I think that goes into this

600
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:27,199
direction I feel right now it's and

601
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,669
that's my personal opinion

602
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,769
that's not my initiative that's

603
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:32,750
community initiative I feel it's not

604
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:35,059
strong enough I think we're building

605
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,279
enough awareness but it's not strong

606
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:39,080
enough to project this as a quality

607
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,909
among its internal awareness that

608
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,769
external awareness that quality mark

609
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:46,100
you're going in the right direction and

610
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:52,789
thank you Matt wrangle Akamai

611
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:54,769
Technologies so given that much much to

612
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:57,408
Matt's point about points of leverage

613
00:29:54,769 --> 00:29:58,730
but also to previous talks regarding cup

614
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:00,889
of tea is going to be something that

615
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:05,080
goes away at least in terms of common

616
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:09,110
operations where have there been any

617
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:10,639
efforts to work with you know people who

618
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,189
are doing stuff with net ng code and

619
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:16,250
what-have-you to actually automate or

620
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,500
make automatable the things that are

621
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:19,970
part and parcel of manners so that you

622
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:22,820
get more leverage saying it isn't just

623
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:25,009
ok do these 35 steps and then I think

624
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,389
you're okay as opposed to actually

625
00:30:25,009 --> 00:30:28,820
making is something more modular it's

626
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:30,709
like add this to your config or things

627
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:34,019
along those lines

628
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:36,869
so well not specifically working with

629
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:40,139
them right so those efforts are taking

630
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:42,809
place there is no real collaboration

631
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:44,399
between manners but I think we're

632
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,769
looking at this for instance what we

633
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,629
plan to do we plan to self create an

634
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:51,029
area on the Manus website which will

635
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:53,279
refer to those projects open source

636
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:55,619
project primarily that actually provide

637
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,159
this modular tools either in our PTI or

638
00:30:55,619 --> 00:31:01,049
in irr world to enable this automation

639
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:02,970
of building filters for instance and

640
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:09,059
other other things that support many

641
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:12,090
sections great thank you hi anis sheikh

642
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:13,590
from Google I just wanted to ask if

643
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,238
you've given thought to I mean following

644
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:18,509
up on the questions around visibility

645
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:19,619
and I've observed bility do you think

646
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:21,330
that we'll get to a point where you

647
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:23,939
actually revoke the membership of

648
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:26,009
manners members when they don't adhere

649
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,960
to some of the norms and I guess related

650
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,059
to that is what do you think has stopped

651
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,379
some of the larger networks from joining

652
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:38,749
manners and the time that it's been

653
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:41,399
established so well one other thing that

654
00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:43,440
there is no one to revoke membership

655
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:46,498
right I think the membership the

656
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:49,200
community itself should decide when the

657
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:52,619
members are no longer belong to this

658
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,479
group right and for this this community

659
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,399
needs information so we discussed this

660
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:58,259
with the community and one of the things

661
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,959
that we need some measurements on how

662
00:31:58,259 --> 00:32:03,450
members sort of stand visibly their

663
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,999
commitment is that information upon

664
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,249
which members can decide to I don't know

665
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:09,929
expel or maybe that just public opinion

666
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:13,499
that you don't get you know you get

667
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:17,460
negative public publicity if you stay on

668
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:20,369
the Manas membership list and you're not

669
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,249
behaving correctly now this is something

670
00:32:20,369 --> 00:32:25,678
for the membership decide right right

671
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:28,859
now what we were providing some tools to

672
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,549
inform them right about their level of

673
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:35,609
of commitment whether it gets publicly

674
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:37,889
exposed at what stage I think that's for

675
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:38,710
the for the members to really discuss

676
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:43,840
and

677
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:45,760
and decide but that is that is to say

678
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,299
that there is no right now there is no

679
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:51,929
mechanism to revoke membership right

680
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:54,190
there is also no processes to

681
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:56,500
continuously money - level of

682
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,659
performance of members that needs to

683
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,220
happen before those mechanisms can can

684
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:05,830
create it but we're working in this

685
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:08,159
direction yes well thank you thank you

686
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,158
very much

687
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,429
