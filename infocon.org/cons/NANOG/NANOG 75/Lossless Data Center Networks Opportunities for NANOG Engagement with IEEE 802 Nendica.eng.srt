1
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:14,379
so hi and my name is Roger marks and I'm

2
00:00:13,029 --> 00:00:16,720
a newcomer it's my first nan-hong

3
00:00:14,379 --> 00:00:20,770
meeting so I'm gonna just take a little

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,859
time to introduce myself I spent 17

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:26,079
years working for NIS teen Istanbul der

6
00:00:23,859 --> 00:00:28,290
Colorado and then I left there and did

7
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,939
some other things and currently I'm a

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,469
consultant working for some companies

9
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:37,420
and developing some of my own

10
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:40,060
technologies and in the most of my

11
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:42,460
activity now is focused on work about I

12
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,739
do within I Triple E 802 which is the

13
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,460
land man Standards Committee that

14
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:51,519
develops standards for layer layer one

15
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:53,620
and layer two I've been happy to hear

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,540
that that's a topic of interest here

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,629
I've heard lots of discussion this week

18
00:00:55,540 --> 00:01:01,809
about issues in 802 dot one working

19
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:04,149
group where we do standards for for

20
00:01:01,809 --> 00:01:06,640
bridging and time sensitive networking

21
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:09,219
for example the ADA 2.3 working group

22
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,020
that develops the ethernet standards 802

23
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:13,839
dot 11 working group develops the

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:16,449
wireless LAN standards and some other

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,409
things that show up so I work across the

26
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:22,270
board currently I'm the vice chair of

27
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:24,729
the I Triple E 802 Executive Committee

28
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,170
so I get a chance to see things that are

29
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:28,240
happening throughout the organization

30
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:32,399
and I work technically throughout some

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,689
of the working groups as well before my

32
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:39,520
consulting period I spent some time

33
00:01:34,689 --> 00:01:42,098
working with the the so called WiMAX

34
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,499
forum which was supporting the I Triple

35
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:46,869
E 802 16 standard that I spent many

36
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:48,699
years chairing that developed this

37
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,679
technology that was popular for a while

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,569
called WiMAX and one of the things that

39
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:55,419
happened when I worked in that forum was

40
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,479
one of my colleagues was Edward McNair

41
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:59,560
who is currently the executive directory

42
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,469
executive director of nanog and

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:04,689
obviously doing a great job here so I do

44
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:06,939
want to thank Edward for suggesting that

45
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:10,720
I bring this topic to two nanog and

46
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:14,590
discuss it and just the last little

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,120
piece there I'd like to say that I'm

48
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,330
really having a great time here and

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,240
thanks to everybody for being friendly

50
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,820
it's a it seems

51
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:24,620
a great organization and a good place to

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:28,190
work in I've become a member and I hope

53
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:31,190
to be back so with that all said injured

54
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,760
as an introduction one of the things

55
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:37,130
that I do in 802 is I chair a group

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,709
called nandaka and I'll tell you about

57
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,870
that and we have been doing some work

58
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:44,120
related to data center networks and I

59
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:48,680
wanted to introduce it to you but also

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:53,150
talk about how we might engage with you

61
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:56,720
folks and and with an ANA interest this

62
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:58,900
talk was actually not just from not for

63
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,359
me but from Nick as a whole and it was

64
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:05,150
approved by the organization and I

65
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,490
Triple E wants me to make sure that you

66
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:09,470
know that if I present information and I

67
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:11,660
Triple E standards I'm speaking on my

68
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:15,620
own behalf and that's my personal view

69
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:19,430
and nevertheless the slides were adopted

70
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,820
by the organization so an indica is a

71
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,380
kind of a new thing that that's

72
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,470
supported with an I Triple E called an

73
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:28,820
industry connections activity and an

74
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,470
indica stands for the network

75
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,810
enhancements for the next decade

76
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,460
industry connections activity so we

77
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,500
don't actually develop standards but we

78
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,420
try to look out to see what might be

79
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,430
coming in the future that would

80
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,799
influence requirements that that would

81
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,880
stimulate standardization that we could

82
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:52,580
do that would be be helpful to to the

83
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:55,609
user community one important thing about

84
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,650
nandaka is that the way we operate is we

85
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,960
don't have any membership so anybody

86
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,450
that wants to participate is entitled to

87
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,890
do so on an equal basis with everybody

88
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,230
else and we don't we don't do any

89
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,700
membership tracking so that makes it a

90
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:12,679
good organization to work with other

91
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:15,079
organizations these industry connections

92
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,840
activities according to the I Triple E

93
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,160
standards Association provided an

94
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,140
efficient environment for building

95
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,810
consensus and developing many different

96
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,340
types of shared results and we don't

97
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,630
develop standards but we do things that

98
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:32,780
could be precursors to standards in a

99
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,830
specific case of an indica we're

100
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,109
supposed

101
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,058
assess emerging requirements for I

102
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,819
Tripoli ADA to wireless and higher layer

103
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:42,499
communication infrastructures looking

104
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,629
for gaps and trends that are not

105
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:46,550
currently dressed and facilitate

106
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:48,469
building industry consensus toward

107
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:51,259
proposals to initiate new standards

108
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:53,449
development efforts and one of the

109
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:56,389
things that we focus on is enhancements

110
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:58,429
that will focus on vertical networks and

111
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:01,039
also enhance cooperative functionality

112
00:04:58,429 --> 00:05:05,299
among the existing 802 standards to

113
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,610
support network integration so during

114
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,800
the two years we've been in existence

115
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,569
we've we've identified two specific

116
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,489
areas where we've gotten work done

117
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:14,959
because people the participants have

118
00:05:13,489 --> 00:05:16,969
brought forward some ideas where they

119
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,309
thought we needed to do some new work

120
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:21,829
and one of them I'm going to focus on

121
00:05:19,309 --> 00:05:24,679
today it's a lots lossless Network for

122
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:26,749
data centers Paul Condon was the editor

123
00:05:24,679 --> 00:05:28,159
of that activity and we published a

124
00:05:26,749 --> 00:05:31,419
report which you can find on our website

125
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:33,319
it was published last August and our

126
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:35,808
reports when they're published they

127
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:37,909
include an invitation to comment on the

128
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:40,849
report and the process for you to submit

129
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:43,550
comments that we'll consider that means

130
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,229
that we're we're thinking about it as an

131
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,419
ongoing activity and we're open to doing

132
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:49,639
revisions to these reports and I think

133
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:53,240
we're probably soon gonna start an

134
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,169
activity to to revise this and I'll tell

135
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,579
you a little bit about one of the

136
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:01,938
specific standardization project that's

137
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:05,300
spun off of this called 8o 2.1 qcz on

138
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:07,999
congestion isolation a second topic that

139
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:11,179
i'm not going to go into today is about

140
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:13,099
unflexible Factory IOT that has a

141
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:15,739
significant focus on wireless in the

142
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:20,829
factory and we have a giraffe report

143
00:06:15,739 --> 00:06:26,119
under development so getting back to the

144
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:28,189
the data center work we list in their

145
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:30,229
reports some of the the key messages

146
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:32,569
that we have about that we wanted to

147
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:35,719
convey in this report is that packet

148
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:38,509
loss leads to large delay and congestion

149
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,308
leads to packet loss there are some

150
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:44,539
conventional methods to deal with those

151
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:46,519
but they're they're problematic even in

152
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:46,919
a layer 3 network we can take action at

153
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:50,190
layer

154
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:54,200
to reduce congestion and thereby loss I

155
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:56,610
just like to add that we've had some

156
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,820
discussions with other organizations

157
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:02,250
including interaction with IETF we did a

158
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,890
workshop together with IETF last

159
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,170
November and Bangkok on this specific

160
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:09,060
topic and it was interesting to see that

161
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,860
the perspective from a lot of the folks

162
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,890
in IETF was that they didn't realize

163
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,660
that that anything in I Tripoli would be

164
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:19,140
relevant to data center networks because

165
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:20,790
they thought of them as being focused on

166
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,669
layer three but they came to understand

167
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:28,380
that the kind of work we do in in 802

168
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:30,540
and I'll talk about today is is could

169
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,840
could support what they're doing even

170
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,930
though it's it takes place below layer

171
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,560
three and the work even though we use

172
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,300
the word lossless in the title we're not

173
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,520
we're not specifying a lossless network

174
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,650
but we're providing methods to progress

175
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:52,620
toward a lossless data center network in

176
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:54,659
the future and the report which hope

177
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,820
you'll take a look at it and see way to

178
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,450
see with it's helpful to you we talked

179
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:04,020
about some of the use cases for data

180
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,890
center networks and online data

181
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,099
intensive services deep learning

182
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:12,500
non-volatile memory Express and

183
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,810
clarification of this central office and

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,690
we tried to extract the commonality and

185
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:20,220
the overall theme there is it is a

186
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:22,200
dependence on the parallel computation

187
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,000
that goes on of the network and how that

188
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:27,210
affects the networking within the data

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,400
center so this figure is taken from the

190
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:33,419
report it's pointing out that the

191
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:35,760
applications are distributed and their

192
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:41,728
latency sensitive and this is basically

193
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:43,740
showing the idea of something that you

194
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:46,230
could think of as a web search where a

195
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,740
request comes in to an aggregator with a

196
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,210
deadline to respond and the request has

197
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,820
to be distributed to some further

198
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:56,430
aggregators and then eventually to some

199
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,870
worker servers or VMs or whatever

200
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,510
containers they may be

201
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,890
on a very short deadline because the

202
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,670
results will have to be brought back

203
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,050
together and one of the one of the

204
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,420
results of that is when all this

205
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,949
information is coming in the network has

206
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:13,140
to bring data in from many different

207
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,270
sources into one central aggregation as

208
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,590
it goes back up as this information

209
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,140
that's collected at the bottom of this

210
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,580
figure goes back up to the top it's all

211
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,740
coming together at the aggregator and

212
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:26,960
resulting in an in caste circumstance

213
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,280
that can lead to packet loss and

214
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:32,070
retransmission more congestion and more

215
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,319
delay I think in many cases the networks

216
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,230
are set up so that they don't if data is

217
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,060
not back by a certain amount of time it

218
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:43,080
times out and and it and it lives

219
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:47,760
without that data but that that can be

220
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:50,700
harmful to the results so we just have a

221
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,040
few figures here to illustrate the kind

222
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,780
of thing that we're we're looking at

223
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,360
it's figure looks a little bit like the

224
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:02,730
one we saw in the last talk you can see

225
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,380
that the that you know in a folded

226
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,540
cloths network you have many paths to

227
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:12,650
get from server to server and we're just

228
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:14,819
showing one path in blue and the popular

229
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:16,100
approaches and you see this kind of you

230
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:21,660
see in this kind of network is a

231
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:25,980
something like ecmp where you you assign

232
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:32,069
a flow to a path at a kind of a quasi

233
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:33,630
random basis and two flows by by chance

234
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:36,090
are probably going to be going to

235
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,820
different different routes and be less

236
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:41,370
likely to hit each other but also

237
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:46,080
distribute the the traffic across the

238
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:48,060
network you know one of the problems you

239
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,700
have when you do a CMP is that you can

240
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:52,619
have just by chance you can have a

241
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,320
couple of large flows that may collide

242
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,580
end up being sent through a same switch

243
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:04,680
and lead to some congestion that that

244
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:06,690
can be hard to to manage another problem

245
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,180
it to try to illustrate the in caste

246
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:11,370
problem is shown here where you have two

247
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:17,370
flows a green flow and a blue

248
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:20,340
and they the because it's in caste and

249
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,790
services are bringing collecting data

250
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:25,170
from multiple places into the same point

251
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,670
I'll just point to this green on the

252
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,270
left you can see that these flows are

253
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,370
coming together and they're they're

254
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:36,990
piling up in an output queue that's

255
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:38,910
going out to to some server and in this

256
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,400
kind of environment you get congestion

257
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,740
at the at the output queue that's not a

258
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,470
result of the route that was taken so

259
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,300
ECPA Kesey and peat can't help because

260
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,480
all these flows no matter what routes

261
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:56,510
they take they're all gonna eventually

262
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,510
result in a busy out output port

263
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:06,329
now I Triple E 802 has a history in this

264
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,430
area this 802 dot one working group had

265
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:11,339
a data center bridging task group for a

266
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,870
number of years and they one of the

267
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,170
standards they developed was originally

268
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:18,630
called 802 dot 1 QB b which specified

269
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,060
priority flow control and that's still

270
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:25,140
in the standard and they did 1q standard

271
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,790
and the basic idea is that let me just

272
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:29,370
step back a little bit before that and

273
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:31,589
earlier kind of concept in 802 theory

274
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:35,520
was the idea of a pause frame and a if a

275
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:37,200
queue got too busy device could send to

276
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,939
the switch a pause frame and say just

277
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,740
hold on a second until I my queue

278
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:44,640
empties that a little bit and that's a

279
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,680
very crude hammer because it stops all

280
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,750
the traffic coming in from that that

281
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:54,890
link so PFC was designed to be a more

282
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:58,680
subtle way to pause traffic and it was

283
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:01,050
priority based and you have in 802 dot1q

284
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,020
you have these eight different QoS

285
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,849
classes and and in many cases you may

286
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:08,670
have different queues for each each

287
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:11,730
traffic class and so if you've got a

288
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:14,069
busy scenario here shown on the output

289
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:18,870
queue where you have greens and blues

290
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:20,949
filling up that the the output queues

291
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,920
and

292
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:25,959
then as a result of that the input cues

293
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,269
are gonna start to fill let's say with

294
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:33,878
this this blue traffic and the PFC lets

295
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:37,869
a message be sent from this switch to

296
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:41,559
this switch saying hold on a second we

297
00:13:37,869 --> 00:13:43,480
need you to pause for a while this

298
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:45,069
particular traffic class you don't have

299
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,589
to pause the other ones but this

300
00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:49,628
particular one hold on to because we're

301
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,089
getting getting filled and that was a

302
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:57,269
useful idea it has been deployed it's

303
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:59,199
it's not it it's it's not unheard of in

304
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,269
environment so that people have had some

305
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,549
difficulties with it it has some

306
00:14:01,269 --> 00:14:05,679
limitations and one of the problems

307
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:09,339
we're concerned about here is the fact

308
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:11,019
that stopping a traffic class is still a

309
00:14:09,339 --> 00:14:13,929
fairly crude hammer because there could

310
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:16,720
be other traffic of the same traffic

311
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:21,309
class that's not part of a congestion

312
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:27,540
problem and a variety I'm going to point

313
00:14:21,309 --> 00:14:31,238
to this screen so this is showing that

314
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:34,899
see here's a green flow and a blue flow

315
00:14:31,239 --> 00:14:37,629
that are combining at some output port

316
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:41,139
to result in in caste but there may be a

317
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:42,549
magenta flow that is coming from a

318
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:45,189
different server and coming out at

319
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,889
different port and really has nothing to

320
00:14:45,189 --> 00:14:52,089
do with the congestion but it's of the

321
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:55,749
same traffic class and so if you if you

322
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:57,220
freeze this this particular traffic

323
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:59,049
class you're gonna freeze this victim

324
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,779
flow and the date is not going to be

325
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:06,399
able to flow even though it's really not

326
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:07,899
necessary to do so for any particularly

327
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,689
good reason it's just that it happens to

328
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:11,919
overlap the co traffic class so that's

329
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:14,618
one of the things that we're trying to

330
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:18,339
deal with in this activity we identified

331
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:20,819
in its report and there as a result of

332
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:23,169
the the report we did start up a new

333
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:25,979
standardization activity this a

334
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:29,759
toe-to-toe one qcz that's looking on at

335
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:34,870
congestion flow isolation and trying to

336
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:37,810
it's more more subtly deal with this

337
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:41,380
of congestion and we try to illustrate

338
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:44,410
here in this figure with four four

339
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,360
states and this is showing I can

340
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:54,699
upstream switch in the downstream switch

341
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:56,860
and and we have some traffic that starts

342
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,110
to build up in an output queue that's

343
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:04,890
this little red bursting hey this this

344
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:04,890
queue is is it's starting to fill and

345
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,920
what we do is when we if we can identify

346
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,439
the flow that's causing this this

347
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,420
difficulty we we put it off in a

348
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,060
separate queue and we start stacking up

349
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:21,699
those those packets in a separate queue

350
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,589
and take them out of the the fill queue

351
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:26,170
and let that queue continue to process

352
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,120
including these victim flows can go

353
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,819
ahead and be processed and that'll

354
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,160
that'll start to fill eventually if it's

355
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,170
very slow then maybe the the input queue

356
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,410
starts to fill and there's a point where

357
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:40,449
we can send a message back this was

358
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,490
identified as a CIP message back to the

359
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,380
next stream saying hey we're starting to

360
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,960
have we're starting to even fill up the

361
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:49,330
queues that are available for this this

362
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,400
traffic and can you can you do the same

363
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:53,830
thing upstream put that into its

364
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,100
separate a separate stack and if it gets

365
00:16:53,830 --> 00:17:03,280
really stacked up we have the ability to

366
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:07,829
to send a PFC to take a bigger hammer to

367
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:11,709
the problem I put in a couple of figures

368
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:14,708
here that illustrate the same idea in a

369
00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:19,690
more detailed way and these figures were

370
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:22,510
taken not from a nimdok output but from

371
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,920
an indica input we just a couple of

372
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:26,200
weeks ago received this interesting

373
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,790
document I think it's interesting here's

374
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,620
a document number you can find it on our

375
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,200
website and it's a contribution that

376
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:35,199
came in from a university that was

377
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,110
looking at some of the proposals that we

378
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,810
had made here and trying to analyze what

379
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:44,439
happens and and this gives you a more

380
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:47,168
detailed example of how this this kind

381
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,629
of congestion isolation will work

382
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:52,239
and what you'll see this is showing the

383
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:55,748
the congested case and they're looking

384
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:57,850
at a very simple analysis in a kind of

385
00:17:55,749 --> 00:17:59,619
kind of a steady state and they're

386
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:04,090
they're showing that this red are

387
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:06,330
congested flows and then here's a port

388
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:09,699
where you have a kind of a mixture of

389
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,009
congestion flow and this non congested

390
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:18,009
the yellow one and it's it's showing

391
00:18:12,009 --> 00:18:22,330
that if you if you simply look at in the

392
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:26,730
steady state based on priority flow

393
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:31,168
control issues that you that you then

394
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:34,119
you you're getting about the these two

395
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:36,970
non congested flows the yellow and the

396
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:40,899
blue are getting about thirty three

397
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:44,109
percent of the capacity that's getting

398
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:47,080
through to the the destination and then

399
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:49,480
it's saying it's it's it's it's saying

400
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:54,489
that if you can have separate queue for

401
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:57,879
this this congested traffic that you can

402
00:18:54,489 --> 00:19:05,799
get these these victim flows up to 66

403
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:08,498
percent throughput without and and

404
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:12,429
maintain the one hundred percent flow to

405
00:19:08,499 --> 00:19:16,210
the the congestion congested flow so I

406
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:17,470
think that it's worth looking at this if

407
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:19,149
you if you're interested in this problem

408
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:21,909
I think these figures are pretty helpful

409
00:19:19,149 --> 00:19:23,469
and there's also the paper that that is

410
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:30,639
the source of these two figures that you

411
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:34,210
might want to refer to another common

412
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:35,649
approach to this kind of problem is to

413
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,549
do explicit congestion notification

414
00:19:35,649 --> 00:19:41,918
there's many forms of this there's layer

415
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:46,119
three and there's layer two forms but

416
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,879
essentially if if you get congestion

417
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,070
there's a possibility of doing feedback

418
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:52,539
back to the source and trying to send a

419
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,039
message back to the source saying hey

420
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:58,910
we've got a blockage here and you need

421
00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:01,520
to hold back there but that involves

422
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:03,650
control loops that the timing is a

423
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,139
little bit tricky and it's a little hard

424
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,910
to understand and analyze that how that

425
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:09,830
might work in all possible scenarios but

426
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:15,310
that's certainly something that's that's

427
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:19,040
used in these cases if you look in the

428
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:22,159
the report that I've been mentioning we

429
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,260
mentioned a few other topics in less

430
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,220
detail but they're ones that were raised

431
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:30,350
in in terms of the discussion as to

432
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,320
issues that that could be relevant and

433
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:36,850
possible approaches to solving some of

434
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:39,439
these congestion issues so this one

435
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:43,969
people are calling low to where packet

436
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,730
spraying and it's it's a little bit like

437
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,770
each CMP in the sense that you

438
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:53,990
distribute your data on multiple paths

439
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:57,410
but what's done here is that the there's

440
00:20:53,990 --> 00:21:00,620
a feedback from the load end talking

441
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,970
about that's able to assess the

442
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,790
congestion and feed it back to the

443
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,290
source and then the data is sent not on

444
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:12,950
a single path but on multiple paths so

445
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:17,510
you have some some basis of something

446
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:21,650
less than a flow it could be a packet by

447
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:24,620
packet basis but because your your data

448
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:27,260
is sent on multiple paths you'd have to

449
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,580
do you'd have a reordering problem

450
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,260
because the packets could come out of

451
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,570
order so they have to be sequenced in

452
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:41,410
some way but that's a a possible way to

453
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:44,899
deal with a more fine grained

454
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:49,220
granularity of the a CMP kind of

455
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,720
approach and another one that we

456
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,840
discussed in the paper or we called

457
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,920
push-and-pull hybrid scheduling and the

458
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,290
basic idea here is that in the in the

459
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:04,000
congestion scenario you can look at

460
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:04,000
cases where the

461
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:14,189
where it's a it's referred to as request

462
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:16,350
grant it's a little bit confusing in a

463
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,560
sense because it's not the way you look

464
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:21,780
at requesting a grants and for example a

465
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:26,070
wireless system or some kind of system

466
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:28,530
like that but the essentially it's it's

467
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:32,550
giving the opportunity for the receiver

468
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:35,280
to provide an indication to the sender

469
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:37,649
when it's time to send and let it be

470
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:42,000
able to send and that's like what's

471
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:46,860
referred to as pole scheduling and then

472
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:51,330
this push and pull hybrid is enables a

473
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:53,340
kind of a transition from fully push

474
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:55,770
data which just sends it and assumes

475
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:58,889
it's going to be getting there until it

476
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:02,190
gets an ACK and then the heavy load

477
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:04,380
where the data is entirely pulled and

478
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,540
only transmitted when when it's been

479
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,730
notified that it's okay to transmit with

480
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:16,560
the transition period in between for

481
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:18,930
kind of like congestion so in the in the

482
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:22,679
report that's that we published it

483
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:28,740
it identifies the congestion caused in

484
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:30,780
these three areas the the first one

485
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:35,970
being that there's a coarseness to

486
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:41,100
priority flow control and the approach

487
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:43,020
of isolating congestion can can mitigate

488
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:48,540
this thing and eliminate the blocking of

489
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:50,370
victims and the approach we call dynamic

490
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,220
virtual Lane of being able to put the

491
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:56,520
congested traffic in its own own lane or

492
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,500
its own queues and that's what's being

493
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,690
pursued in this new standardization

494
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,370
project and the other two are the load

495
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,100
aware packet spraying and the push and

496
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,899
pull hybrid scheduling which we haven't

497
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,080
hasn't yet led to any standardization

498
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:17,570
activity but it it could if we get the

499
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,490
interest on those topics so I'd like to

500
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,559
point you to

501
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:24,110
documents that I've referred to here the

502
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:27,110
first one is just the the an indica

503
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:31,010
activity itself the second one is that

504
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:33,050
report published in in August if you

505
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,419
look at the nanika you can also see a

506
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:36,918
[Music]

507
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:39,169
link to an interesting workshop that we

508
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:41,090
did with IETF in November that has a lot

509
00:24:39,169 --> 00:24:45,230
of presentations related to data center

510
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:52,100
some from the 802 perspective and some

511
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:54,320
from that IETF perspective number 3 is a

512
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,590
is a contribution from which I took some

513
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,490
of the figures in this presentation

514
00:24:56,590 --> 00:25:07,428
number 4 is this new contribution that

515
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:09,320
we got earlier this month that I'm which

516
00:25:07,429 --> 00:25:11,809
has a typo in the year because it's not

517
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:16,820
2012 it's 2019 when we received that

518
00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:18,770
document and the the last one is a

519
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,950
reference to this new standardization

520
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,750
project so I'd like to take a few

521
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:27,020
minutes to talk about going forward

522
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,899
because part of what I have in mind and

523
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,649
I talked to with the some of the Nanog

524
00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:35,840
folks before I came is the idea that

525
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:39,168
we're trying to get some interest from

526
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,850
Nanog in this in this activity and not

527
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:41,659
just what we published but what we may

528
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,129
do in the future

529
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:48,200
and try to get some engagement so we're

530
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,049
looking to comments on the current

531
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,419
document but also ideas on where we

532
00:25:51,049 --> 00:26:00,039
could go in the in the future

533
00:25:53,419 --> 00:26:03,559
and one point I'd like to make is that

534
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:06,850
this this document that I mentioned that

535
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:11,510
that showed the new figures is our

536
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:13,850
reference number for just came in to us

537
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,950
and we we schedule that for a discussion

538
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,490
in a teleconference which is a week from

539
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:19,279
tomorrow

540
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,809
so you're welcome to call in to our

541
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,419
teleconference if you're interested to

542
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:26,570
hear a presentation of that document and

543
00:26:23,419 --> 00:26:28,640
we'll all be trying to find out what's

544
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,649
in there and what proposed

545
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,180
they made so if you look on our website

546
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:40,760
you'll see how to connect to that

547
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:42,800
teleconference so I'd like to at least

548
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,310
bring up the idea of some kind of

549
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,350
cooperation with with nanog nan dick has

550
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:50,870
opened a participant participation from

551
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,850
anybody there's no qualification so if

552
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:56,239
you want to participate in an indica

553
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:59,389
teleconferences or participate in the

554
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:03,280
written comment submission process feel

555
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:06,410
free I encourage you to do that and I

556
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,330
think on the nimdok aside were open to

557
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:12,170
activity that would lead to some kind of

558
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:14,600
common engagement and at the bottom here

559
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:16,880
it says we can be happy to convene

560
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,830
indica meetings in conjunction with

561
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,170
Nanog meetings if that would help get

562
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:22,639
some joint discussion I think one of the

563
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,940
things I learned at this meeting is that

564
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,190
a potentially good opportunity to have

565
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:32,240
that kind of discussion could be through

566
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:34,400
a track or a tutorial slot at a future

567
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,980
Nanog meeting where we could try to

568
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:41,830
focus on some of these issues so that's

569
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,830
one of the things that I've learned here

570
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:49,850
so you can find out all the information

571
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,760
you need a thing to participate here and

572
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:54,669
you can feel free to contact me if you

573
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:58,310
need more information on how to do that

574
00:27:54,670 --> 00:28:02,210
so please feel free to join our

575
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:04,639
teleconferences and let's see if we can

576
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:07,190
talk about how to proceed and I'm

577
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,470
certainly currently thinking about

578
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:12,410
trying to propose a track or tutorial

579
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:14,990
program for Nanog 76 at which we could

580
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,610
do some some further discussion and I

581
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:19,520
think the last point on here was that

582
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:22,939
the the folks that are involved in this

583
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,690
802 dot1q CZ project on congestion

584
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:29,680
isolation wanted me to let you know that

585
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:32,180
they would be happy to do a presentation

586
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,610
for the nanog

587
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,690
audience so nanog folks want to learn

588
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:38,658
more about what's going on in that

589
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,669
standardization activity they would do

590
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:44,989
conference and just focus on what that

591
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:47,450
standardization project is doing so I'm

592
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:50,960
done and I appreciate your time it's

593
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,580
been great being at Nanog and I've I've

594
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,470
learned a lot and it's actually changed

595
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,939
my way of thinking about how I'm gonna

596
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,039
proceed and what I'm going to be doing

597
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:59,389
after this meeting and I hope this same

598
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:04,299
thing is true for you and if you have

599
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:04,299
any comments or questions let me know

600
00:29:06,879 --> 00:29:14,619
West Gorge with byte grid my company is

601
00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:17,899
fairly small but we do data center stuff

602
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:22,340
we do data center stuff for a number of

603
00:29:17,899 --> 00:29:26,658
enterprises and looking at this what I'm

604
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:28,459
seeing is a lot of complexity and as the

605
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:30,739
Stuckey that would end up being the

606
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,970
person that has to try to explain to a

607
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:33,970
customer why they don't need this

608
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,629
because I'm very much of the philosophy

609
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,349
that the Q in in QoS should stand for

610
00:29:41,629 --> 00:29:47,809
quantity that this is a much a lot of

611
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:50,779
these problems here my initial thought

612
00:29:47,809 --> 00:29:52,279
is the easier way to solve this in the

613
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:56,769
vast majority of cases is to throw

614
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:59,419
bandwidth at the problem I'm curious if

615
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:03,909
there has been any discussion along

616
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:06,279
those lines in this context of you know

617
00:30:03,909 --> 00:30:09,859
where the trade-off is between

618
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:13,940
additional complexity versus the benefit

619
00:30:09,859 --> 00:30:16,189
because there's a you know you sort of

620
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,210
have this this operational complexity

621
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:19,519
you have to deal with you know of

622
00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:21,889
managing the additional nerd knobs to

623
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,720
make this stuff work and it may in

624
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:25,399
certain circumstances be the absolute

625
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,039
right solution I'm not trying to you

626
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:31,219
know dismiss this out of hand but

627
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:34,669
there's an awful lot of places where you

628
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:36,289
know it's it's chasing the shiny instead

629
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:37,849
of looking for a more a simpler solution

630
00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:40,879
so I'm just curious your thoughts on

631
00:30:37,849 --> 00:30:42,950
that well certainly there are there are

632
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:46,969
issues and if you look at about nerd

633
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:49,410
knobs I think that the the ecn issues

634
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,150
where you have to send messages back

635
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:54,050
source that has that anything that has a

636
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:57,000
feedback loop in it it's very difficult

637
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,530
to imagine that you're just gonna set

638
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,690
that set it and forget it because

639
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,820
there's just timing issues and it's like

640
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:04,290
hard to know it's hard to think about

641
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,820
how you could do an analysis that would

642
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:08,909
would get that right and I think that's

643
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:13,649
one of the concerns that we've had in

644
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:16,440
terms of I can hear you particularly

645
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:19,020
because if you look at PFC itself it is

646
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,670
a standard it was implemented but some

647
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,470
people turn it off because they find

648
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,990
that their it introduces some

649
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:26,970
uncertainty and it maybe some cases lead

650
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:28,890
to problems and they're not sure if that

651
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:32,220
was the cause of the problem or exactly

652
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:34,830
what that was so I think people are

653
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,750
sensitive to the issue and I think that

654
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:42,870
there's an intention to think that this

655
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:45,780
could be a automatic process that that

656
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,250
doesn't get in your way and and make

657
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,350
some improvement I think that throwing

658
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:50,730
bandwidth it is what because the in

659
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,439
casts in error no matter how much

660
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,950
bandwidth there could be scenarios where

661
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,150
you can get just too much data

662
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,380
converging on to a port at a time and

663
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:02,460
that's the thing that's trying to deal

664
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,740
with I'm sure that in the development of

665
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:08,550
the standard there's going to be a lot

666
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,370
of burden on the development to show to

667
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:12,210
simulate at least and show the

668
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:15,270
practicality and the advantages of using

669
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,720
it and hopefully people would would find

670
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,720
that interesting

671
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:24,510
hey I'm Cisco Systems thanks for the

672
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:26,490
talk so it was a interesting talk and

673
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,050
interesting take on how to solve issues

674
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:29,670
so I think some of the solution that

675
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,530
you're talking about in in in how you

676
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:33,360
can have a lossless data center network

677
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:35,370
I mean I think we already solve it at

678
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,310
the l3 level but I understand your plan

679
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:41,340
is to solve it at the at the l2 l2 layer

680
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:43,260
right yeah I think that this kind of

681
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:46,230
discussion that you you talked about

682
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,150
looking at the internal workings of the

683
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,040
switch with the queues based thing it's

684
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,710
not something that people usually look

685
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:55,620
at it that the l2 layer so is I think

686
00:32:52,710 --> 00:33:00,150
there are I think personally think that

687
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,668
there are opportunities to do more

688
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:04,219
improvements at

689
00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:07,519
actually is a layer two functionalities

690
00:33:04,219 --> 00:33:09,799
but this is looking at something that's

691
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,929
kind of a little bit above layer to our

692
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:13,609
answer so so one specific thing I was

693
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:14,989
interested in was that in one of your

694
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:18,559
diagrams you had mentioned that one of

695
00:33:14,989 --> 00:33:20,479
the causes is unbalanced a CMP that you

696
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:23,389
you know you have multiple leaves were

697
00:33:20,479 --> 00:33:26,570
probably you know hashing to the same

698
00:33:23,389 --> 00:33:27,769
same spine so from their perspective

699
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,149
they are balanced because all the flows

700
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:31,009
that they have they are balancing

701
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:31,849
balancing them correctly but the

702
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,879
unbalanced

703
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:36,829
unbalancing is happening at a different

704
00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:38,899
box right so because they don't have

705
00:33:36,829 --> 00:33:40,908
global knowledge I mean how is that even

706
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:45,139
possible to solve using a scheme like

707
00:33:40,909 --> 00:33:47,649
this well the I think if you look at for

708
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:47,649
example the

709
00:33:55,909 --> 00:34:01,609
an example like the little aware packet

710
00:33:58,849 --> 00:34:04,039
spraying it's a it's it's a kind of a

711
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:05,958
it's not exactly global knowledge but

712
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:07,609
it's it's knowledge coming from the

713
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:10,039
source of the congestion that you could

714
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:13,549
somehow feedback so this this kind of

715
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:16,399
approach is one that could could assist

716
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:25,369
in dealing with that that ecmp collision

717
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:28,308
problem okay thank you in regard to this

718
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:31,009
specific approach are you suggesting

719
00:34:28,309 --> 00:34:34,039
that reordering and end systems are no

720
00:34:31,009 --> 00:34:36,049
longer an issue this would probably be

721
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,579
the presumption here would be that you'd

722
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:42,500
have to you'd have to number and

723
00:34:37,579 --> 00:34:44,599
sequences and reorder the packets okay I

724
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,029
mean the systems already do reordering

725
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,319
but so my question is is it no longer an

726
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:52,518
issue in say modern systems reorder

727
00:34:50,319 --> 00:34:54,109
because then we can just turn on you

728
00:34:52,518 --> 00:34:57,558
know per packet load balancing right

729
00:34:54,109 --> 00:35:00,980
well for from the layer two perspective

730
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:03,259
it's it's it's been understood to be

731
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:06,470
incumbent on the layer two folks that

732
00:35:03,259 --> 00:35:08,269
you have to deliver packets an order you

733
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:11,328
know so means you have to have full l2

734
00:35:08,269 --> 00:35:14,899
across from from ingress dangerous right

735
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:16,970
yeah well you don't so you know and you

736
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,220
don't you don't have to as long as it

737
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,689
sits in some flow however you define a

738
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:26,689
flow then you have to keep those in

739
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:28,519
order so if so I think from an l2

740
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:31,220
perspective yes this would be an

741
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:35,269
additional sequencing that would be

742
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:38,808
applied but means the whole thing is

743
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:40,368
cell to the whole picture is up - yeah I

744
00:35:38,809 --> 00:35:43,250
think that's right aren't you guys

745
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:45,109
thinking of how you can maybe cross them

746
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:49,849
let the layers a little bit there with

747
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:54,740
the solutions I think that if you look

748
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:56,990
at the yeah I think I think there is an

749
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:58,669
intention to to try to cry to do a kind

750
00:35:56,990 --> 00:36:01,700
of a cross layer solution I think that's

751
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:04,910
where we've seen some harmonization with

752
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,859
their opening the door with IETF to see

753
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:09,129
where we can some

754
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,630
a compliment I think that with most of

755
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:16,000
these approaches the intention is

756
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:20,080
probably to supplement the l2 solution

757
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,830
but not to they'll supplement the l3

758
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,990
solution

759
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:25,390
yeah just l3 knows that there's more

760
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:35,220
than one way to get to then system l2

761
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:39,190
doesn't right exactly all right thanks

762
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,189
[Applause]

763
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,400
you
