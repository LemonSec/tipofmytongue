1
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:15,440
good morning everyone we kind of all

2
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,440
filter in so we can kind of

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:23,119
anybody in the room hungover from last

4
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,720
night

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:33,629
show of hands

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:35,489
I don't drink so if anyone needs it a

7
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:42,420
designated driver sometime just let me

8
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:45,690
know all right we're gonna do something

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,960
a little different today it's my goal

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,629
that we create more transparency and

11
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,360
openness within the organizers my

12
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,160
clicker within our organization so today

13
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,500
we're gonna have a community meeting

14
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,849
gonna be about 30 minutes I'm gonna go

15
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,489
over a few topics that I think are

16
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,940
relevant to our community and give you a

17
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:08,729
chance to get some feedback

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:11,100
so why community meetings now MOG is the

19
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,920
is really devoted to its community and

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,330
the people that make up our community we

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,789
want to develop an environment of

22
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,520
openness and transparency we have a

23
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:22,950
desire for open dialogue and meaningful

24
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,140
conversations we want to keep our

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,380
community informed and we're hoping for

26
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,840
constructive feedback within the namma

27
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,170
community with to create a more open and

28
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,479
diverse environment so what I'd like to

29
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,909
talk to you about today is first of all

30
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,158
the code of conduct tina referenced it

31
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,170
in the opening but i want to go in and

32
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,479
just line by line let you understand

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,829
what it is and again solicit some

34
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,869
feedback about that so you can

35
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,309
understand what kind of community we're

36
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,640
trying to build and reinforce with the

37
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,979
Nanog a second i want to talk about nana

38
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,990
outreach we're making a transition

39
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,210
you've known it before is Nanog on the

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,310
road and we're trying to expand it so

41
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,020
that we can do more outreach within our

42
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,810
community that'll hopefully feedback

43
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,940
into the membership and do more good

44
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,070
within our community I'm gonna go over

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,070
the website I talked about it briefly

46
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:15,420
I'm not gonna do an actual demo but I'm

47
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,739
gonna take you through so a few screens

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,809
so you can see how we've changed our

49
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,579
navigation some of the improvements were

50
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:23,750
made and let you know how you can go

51
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:23,750
find take a look at it

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,959
can I go back weird sorry I wouldn't get

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,360
a chance to meet the staff and then open

54
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:43,180
up for Q&A so I have a truncated first

55
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:46,090
line but that's okay so our code of

56
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,920
conduct we've since a lot of time on

57
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,080
this and trying to create a document

58
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,579
that will again reinforce community

59
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,970
openness diversity so in our code of

60
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,310
conduct we are trying to avoid any

61
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:02,920
unwelcome behavior including our not

62
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,490
limited to aggressive pushing of your

63
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,959
own services of products or causes

64
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,930
distribution or consumption of alcohol

65
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:12,790
in nanog Contracting spaces and this is

66
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,430
basically any alcohol that's not served

67
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,260
by the hotel so we don't want you having

68
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:22,510
a little homemade hooch being passed

69
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:24,970
around through the community audio video

70
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,329
recordings of the few sessions we're

71
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,430
recording is not permitted engaging in

72
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,890
any activity that is illegal or violates

73
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,600
nanog or there are sponsors contracts

74
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,519
and the with the venues or our

75
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:41,859
contractors offensive comments physical

76
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,920

lack thereof sexual images of any kind

82
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,459

85
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:12,150

sustained distribution of presentations

88
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,349
or sorry sustained disruption of

89
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,599
presentations or other events

90
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:25,480
inappropriate physical contact and

91
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,860
unwelcome sexual attention I think this

92
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,110
is something we probably all can agree

93
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,530
to but again there give me a chance for

94
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,930
Q&A for you to give your feedback

95
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,169
outreach outreach is something that's

96
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:39,389
kind of really near and dear to me

97
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,729
and I think the purpose of outreach is

98
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:44,060
to increase diversity within our

99
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,490
community and to do so we must look

100
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,560
outward there's there's no way you're

101
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,539
gonna create diversity within a closed

102
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,449
environment the only way you're gonna

103
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:57,270
create diversity is by looking outwards

104
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:59,939
and trying to bring more people who have

105
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,889
different points of views or are come

106
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:04,650
from different situations to help build

107
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,449
and reinforce our community educational

108
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,239
outreach beyond our community is crucial

109
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:12,569
to the development and diverse ecosystem

110
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,610
it is our plan to empower students women

111
00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:17,069
people of color and groups living in

112
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,590
areas unless with less access and

113
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:21,840
resources we plan to work with community

114
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,419
liaisons to plan and deliver targeted

115
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:31,020
programming that resonates within each

116
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:32,818
unique audience the website so we've

117
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,159
spent a lot of time trying to focus and

118
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,900
rebuild the website I'm very fortunate

119
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:38,460
to have a great team of people who have

120
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,229
been sitting here and spending a lot of

121
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,938
hours so that we can kind of restructure

122
00:05:40,229 --> 00:05:43,889
our website so that we can have better

123
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,539
communications within with for our

124
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:48,689
community and with a prospective

125
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,419
audience it's about Nana as I mentioned

126
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:54,389
before our website is kind of divided

127
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:56,669
into sits in sections where there is the

128
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,319
public facing piece for people are come

129
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:00,659
in and figure out what is nanog and

130
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,389
there's also the meeting area and then

131
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,860
the other section of it is the area

132
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:07,110
where people who are doing business

133
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,960
within Nanog you're submitting a

134
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:11,639
presentation etc so first I want to talk

135
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,068
about just kind of go over the

136
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,259
navigation and for those of you want to

137
00:06:14,069 --> 00:06:20,370
take a look at the new site that's up

138
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:22,199
the beta it's at noon an org so you can

139
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,449
always go to new Domino go to org and

140
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,509
you can see the new website so I want to

141
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:31,080
talk about our navigation structure so

142
00:06:27,509 --> 00:06:33,180
as you can see the first navigation

143
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,949
structure is participate so I was trying

144
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,779
to create a structure that was focused

145
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:39,240
on making it easier to find out where

146
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:42,300
things are so how do I participate in

147
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,300
nanog membership there's a tender

148
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,279
meeting presented nanog and sponsored an

149
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,940
on ways that you can contribute ways

150
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,680
that you can get involved

151
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,790
then they get into the section about

152
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:59,750
Nana what we do who we are our story

153

one-time thing

177
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:12,710
I just think it's really important for

178
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,570
the community to get a chance to the

179
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,710
know the people who help make all these

180
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,710
meetings of reality

181
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:26,039

182
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,620

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,390
director Valerie works in conjunction

185
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:36,150
with the program community to make the

186
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,919
content in these meetings of reality she

187
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,490

188
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,978

190
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:52,290
director day Harvey is magical she puts

191
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:55,439
a ton of work into making these meetings

192
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:58,770
amazing and she's made me promise that I

193
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,980
won't make her talk so I will do that

194
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,390
for the time being and then we have in

195
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,980
our new additions to our staff because

196
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:06,330
now we've doubled we had three staff

197
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,390
members and now we have a whopping six

198
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,860
people when I first got here and I

199
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,170
realized that there were only three

200
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,570
people to make these meetings happen I

201
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:18,990
was just absolutely blown away I mean

202
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,240
these are huge undertakings and just you

203
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,400
know Betty Day and Val I just hats off

204
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:27,120
it was just so much to pull these things

205
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:30,420
off so we have some new people and first

206
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,620
of all we have brandy Herrera and brandy

207
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:36,510
is our senior content strategist I had

208
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,570
the fortune of knowing brandy for a

209
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:43,080
while before I had tried to get her to

210
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,730
join Nanog and at first she said no no

211
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:52,170
I'm not interested I don't think that's

212
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:54,860
gonna be fun no no no no no but now

213

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:09,180
helping to come up with rewriting all

220
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,140
amazing job and we're really fortunate

221

wonderful job for Nanna

00:10:34,099 --> 00:10:37,970
it was just a thought that we were we've

229
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,498
grown to such a size it'll be important

230
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,199
to have someone who worked for nanog who

231
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:44,509
was focusing on our our customers and

232
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:47,118
who was just that was her singular focus

233
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:49,549

is our senior designer and I'm just

242
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:15,319
really thrilled to have the combination

243
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:17,119
of people that I have here I'm also a

244
00:11:15,319 --> 00:11:18,709
designer so it was kind of I was always

245
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,329
kind of worried what would it be like me

246
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:23,569
picking someone who's gonna be a

247
00:11:20,329 --> 00:11:25,669
designer and I am thrilled to have Lee

248
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:28,098
aboard we think really well we get along

249
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:31,939
really well so it just all kind of works

250
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:33,859
magical so here's a team here's the

251
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:36,309
people that make this happen I want to

252
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:38,449
give a chance for a little bit of QA

253
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:40,549
anything you guys want to talk about the

254
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:46,189
mics were open come up and we're gonna

255
00:11:40,549 --> 00:11:48,019
try to answer anything you can Edward -

256
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:49,879
thank you - and thank you to the staff

257
00:11:48,019 --> 00:11:52,039
up there I think one of the questions

258
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,509
that came up this morning over breakfast

259
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,239
which i think is really good for us to

260
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:58,850
talk about is right now we have a

261
00:11:56,239 --> 00:12:01,729
two-tier structure with men are we have

262
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:03,139
members then we have non-members and at

263
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:05,509
the start of the meeting we had a slide

264
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:07,129
that said hey we've got 300 and some

265
00:12:05,509 --> 00:12:09,169
members we've got 300 and some

266
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:10,819
first-time attendees and then there's

267
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:14,689
the rest of you unwashed masses that

268
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:18,409
just show up my question to you and the

269
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:20,839
rest of the community is is there still

270
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:23,449
a purpose to maintaining a two-tier

271
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,949
structure of saying hey there's members

272
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:27,738
who are special and they get special

273
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:29,238
member bacon in the breakfast but then

274
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:31,819
there's everybody else who shows up to

275
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:34,129
these meetings why not open up the

276
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:36,259
participation - everybody who attends

277
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:38,720
the meeting why not make it so that if

278
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:41,029
you're here you can vote for board

279
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,179
members you can participate you have an

280
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:46,279
equal say rather than continuing this

281
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,108
kind of casts partner well first of all

282
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:50,779
that would be I appreciate your comments

283
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:52,789
that would be a bylaw change okay and

284
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:54,379
the reason why we're having the

285
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:56,269
community meetings is because I think

286
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,059
it's important that the entire community

287
00:12:56,269 --> 00:13:01,189
is a is informed and I'm looking for

288
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:04,100
feedback from the entire community as we

289
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:06,049
kind of go forward I have known kind of

290
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,869
personal views about membership but I'll

291
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:11,600
just kind of keep that to myself but I

292
00:13:08,869 --> 00:13:13,639
think it's really critical that we we

293
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:17,149
include everyone and that's why we're

294
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:20,389
having these community meetings yes hi

295
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:22,279
Patrick Gilmore board member and one of

296
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:28,189
the people who started the two-tier

297
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:30,949
system just so that we're here to be a

298
00:13:28,189 --> 00:13:32,478
501 C 3 and the way we did it there's

299
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:35,839
lots of ways to do it by the way we did

300
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:39,799
it requires a Membership class now that

301
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,119
class doesn't have to be restrictive or

302
00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:42,529
whatever we made it a hundred dollars

303
00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:44,149
and then we gave you 25 dollars off of

304
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,159
thing trying to make it pretty much as

305
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:48,289
easy as possible etcetera etcetera we

306
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,239
could look at redoing how membership is

307
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:51,679
defined and their different ways of

308
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:53,569
doing it but we need a membership

309
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,879
legally or at least that was the legal

310
00:13:53,569 --> 00:14:00,279
advice when we broke from merit a long

311
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:03,350
time ago so yeah we need members but

312
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:04,909
maybe we just bump the registration fee

313
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,989
and make everybody who attends a member

314
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:07,039
but then that would leave people out

315
00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:08,959
from the mailing list etcetera etcetera

316
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,159
so there's this is a very long

317
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,268
conversation and I don't think we should

318
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,989
have it right here but just realize that

319
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:17,329
we actually did think about it and the

320
00:14:14,989 --> 00:14:19,369
membership is strictly things like you

321
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,679
know you to get some perks but it's

322
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:23,539
mostly to create the 501c3 have voting

323
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,579
rights and things like that if you come

324
00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:27,769
here if you're an attendee there's no

325
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:28,789
limits on you know attending any of

326
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,369
those sessions or anything like that

327
00:14:28,789 --> 00:14:32,529
based on whether you remember or not

328
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,720
Thank You Patrick

question is is nano membership strictly

332
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:49,870
for professionals is the open to student

333
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:52,339
and it's open to anyone yes

334
00:14:49,870 --> 00:15:02,000
so your grandmother could be a member of

335
00:14:52,339 --> 00:15:03,889
not any other questions all right Sean

336
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,870
Kennedy and I'm an anti volunteer

337
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:10,790
that's my only affiliation right now so

338
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,199
great job on the hotel I particularly

339
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:14,810
like the atrium there's a lot of spaces

340
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:16,459
to meet and talk the open seating area

341
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,010
has been very valuable can you talk a

342
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:22,130
little bit maybe two to five minutes

343
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,389
about how you select hotels some of the

344
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,829
cities we're going to I realize you

345
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:28,160
don't have the slides in front and how

346
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:31,370
far in advance does nanog plan location

347
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,969
sizing so on okay well we plan in that

348
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:41,480
and advances you can hold your fingers

349
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:42,680
up it's on you know at the top yeah two

350
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,980
years advance we're right now we're

351
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:48,829
three years out and we based upon a

352
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,149
criteria of first of all I'm very clear

353
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:52,519
to the membership we don't want to be in

354
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:54,320
convention spaces so that means we have

355
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,140
to find hotels which are large enough to

356
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,180
accommodate a group this size so a lot

357
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,680
of the restrictions come in in the size

358
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:04,790
of the events the rooms that are

359
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:10,790
available and that restricts us we also

360
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:12,709
try to it's a rotation every yeah Ward

361
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:16,189
another conference meetings which are in

362
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:18,040
our space such as IETF or MOG even

363
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:21,350
though we did collide with MOG this year

364
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,540
so that people who travel to a series of

365
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,670
events they can go to the events without

366
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,910
thinking oh I've got to choose between

367
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:33,260
nanog and going to IETF meeting the

368
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:36,050
Canadian rotation is yeah Canada every

369
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:39,740
three years again as part of North

370
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:42,529
America and the meetings up in the queue

371
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:45,889
we're gonna be in DC is our next meeting

372
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:48,649
Austin is after that back here in San

373
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,600
Francisco so I'm sorry Boston because

374
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,980
she's got to list my cheat sheet she

375
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,699
knows it in her head but I'm gonna be

376
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:58,959
kind to her so it's in Washington DC

377
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:01,160
Austin San Francisco Boston Seattle

378
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,619
Atlanta Minneapolis

379
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,689
than Toronto but again the biggest

380
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:13,159
restriction is the size of the actual

381
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:16,039
event I know you're not so another thing

382
00:17:13,159 --> 00:17:17,630
I'm I think it's really well okay

383
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:20,890
so the other thing is this the

384
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,270
availability of meeting rooms because

385
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:26,419
many of the organizations that come here

386
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:29,960
want to have private meetings so we look

387
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:33,320
at the availability of private meeting

388
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,110
rooms and also the big ballrooms we need

389
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,210
a room like this and the you went to

390
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,979
beer and gear last night so we need a

391
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,070
room that can accommodate beer and gear

392
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,900
which is one of our most popular events

393
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,399
and then sometimes we've had to been in

394
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,590
spaces where we have a flipped the

395
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,419
ballroom for a beer and gear and I think

396
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,549
we have one event coming up who I have

397
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:54,080
to do that but we try to avoid that if

398
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:56,960
possible it's a lot of work for our

399
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,490
contractors to come in working all day

400
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,490
long I didn't happen to come in and turn

401
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:03,140
a room over and then come back have beer

402
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:08,330
and gear and then turn the room over in

403
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:17,600
the morning so we try to be kind any

404
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:19,580
other questions sorry a part of this is

405
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,230
to correct my oversight before my name

406
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,710
is Matt P Jack I forgot to introduce

407
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:27,169
myself thank you the first question

408
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:30,710
again Matt PTAC so in the past well the

409
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:32,390
questions that's come up is why three

410
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,970
times a year we do a joint meeting with

411
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,510
Erin in October which works out really

412
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,309
well

413
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:42,260
and and you're gonna tell me it's a

414
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:44,899
bylaw change right have we thought about

415
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:46,850
doing a pairing up and doing two

416
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,340
meetings a year or we just join up with

417
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:53,330
air and we do April and October instead

418
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,439
of three times a year good question this

419
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,059
is Patrick again I'm gonna take this

420
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,809
because Edward doesn't wasn't around

421
00:18:56,059 --> 00:19:00,620
when we did this several times so

422
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:05,120
personally I think it should be twice

423
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:07,158
here and what we do is we survey the

424
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,479
membership every two three four years

425
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,159
and we say would you like to go to two

426
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,979
times a year

427
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,929
and the overwhelming majority say no

428
00:19:11,979 --> 00:19:15,460
they want to keep it at 3 some of the

429
00:19:13,929 --> 00:19:17,349
reasons given is that I can't go to

430
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:19,029
every meeting but if I if there's three

431
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:21,489
missing one isn't too bad if I miss one

432
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:24,489
of two that's worse some of the other

433
00:19:21,489 --> 00:19:26,019
ones are you know from silly to I really

434
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:27,669
like to meet people for three times a

435
00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:31,289
year because it fits my business needs

436
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:33,999
etc etc we do what the membership and

437
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:36,700
community in general wants this actually

438
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:40,119
was a survey of the entire nanog

439
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,440
community not just the membership maybe

440
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:43,749
things have changed maybe we should run

441
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,049
the survey again and ask but we've tried

442
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:48,580
to change the to before and just the

443
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,879
membership in the sorry the community

444
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,320
didn't want it yeah and again this is

445
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:54,639
the purpose of these community meetings

446
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,289
so you may chance to understand what

447
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:59,830
we're doing and then get feedback from

448
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:04,599
all of you straw poll who here wants two

449
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:07,149
types of beer raise your hand who wants

450
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:09,928
three times a year raise your hand no

451
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:09,928
two hands in the air

452
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,049
no I'm not asking for four again this is

453
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,029
the purpose of these to get raise your

454
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:22,289
hands you know let us know someone says

455
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:26,200
we want to do something we need feedback

456
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:29,529
all right I guess if there are no other

457
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,489
questions thank you for your time

458
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,289
appreciate it

459
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:34,979
oh no if there's more questions please

460
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,979
we got time

461
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,000
hi it's mike from yes net um just a

462
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:49,310
question to you guys cuz i know that

463
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,460
there's a we're kind of on a borderline

464
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:54,800
in terms of our attendance and there's a

465
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:56,420
very limited set of hotels we can use if

466
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,310
we went to two meetings a year would

467
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:02,000
that have implications for that as well

468
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,649
in terms of make it harder for us to go

469
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,420
to second-tier cities and make it harder

470
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:08,270
for us to find hotel most definitely

471
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,610
most definitely and there's also the

472
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:13,040
option of a hybrid where you have two

473
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,800
large anchor meetings a year then a

474
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:23,420
smaller one that's in a you know second

475
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:25,490
or third-tier soon thanks hmm all right

476
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:26,640
if nothing else thank you all for your

477
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:34,170
time

478
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:34,170
[Applause]

479
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,780
you
