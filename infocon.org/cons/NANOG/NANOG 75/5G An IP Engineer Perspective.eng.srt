1
00:00:11,509 --> 00:00:15,360
hello good morning everyone my name is

2
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:17,189
Egor Jin grossie I'm part of the

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,060
consulting engineering team and no care

4
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:23,910
working mobile operators and 5g is an

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,529
interesting talk to talk about here

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,210
because it looks like these days that

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:31,439
you can talk about pretty much anything

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,210
and relate somehow to 5g but the idea

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,160
here is to go through some of the

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,559
requirements on IP networks because

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,900
before any radio can be deployed before

12
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:43,199
anybody can actually use their cell

13
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,120
phones to use the 5g network we need an

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:47,099
IP infrastructure in place to

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,358
interconnect everything so that's the

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,510
idea of the talk before we go into the

17
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:59,910
technical part of it I think it's nice

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,149
to go through what is 5g well that's a

19
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:05,119
kind of hard thing to define because

20
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:08,280
there's multiple ways of looking at the

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,310
technology here you have a brief history

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,960
of mobile networks and you can probably

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,979
tell your age by the first mobile phone

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,490
you have so we went all the way from

25
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,950
analog phones that was basically circuit

26
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,220
switching voice over radio that what it

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,330
was

28
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,709
so analog radios doing voice calls

29
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:32,130
believe it or not it was made for voice

30
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:33,479
calls at the beginning and then we end

31
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:35,640
all the way through the different

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,520
generation so 2g was all about

33
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,020
digitizing the radio interface of

34
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,630
digital voice it was actually the first

35
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,509
time we got some data capabilities on

36
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,440
mobile networks than 3G

37
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,819
basically enhanced those data

38
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:56,250
capabilities we had the iPhone as the

39
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:59,819
flagship cell phone of that generation

40
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,979
and then 4G further enhance that with

41
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,610
the notion that we didn't have actually

42
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,590
circuit switch connections anymore so 4G

43
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,628
is actually the first mobile generation

44
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:14,940
where we have an all IP network so we

45
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:17,760
move voice runs on voice over IP now we

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,829
are in this phase where we need to

47
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,500
transition between this 4G technology

48
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:23,500
that we all use today and it's good as

49
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,660
long as they have good

50
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,590
coverage you can have pretty good

51
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:34,810
service and go to this new generation so

52
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:37,090
what does it look like a 5g network many

53
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:38,650
people think that 3gpp is actually the

54
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,780
standards body that define the

55
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:45,670
generations but it's actually not it's

56
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:49,300
actually ITU so the ITU every 10 years

57
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,220
or so works on and the requirements for

58
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:53,320
what's gonna be the next generation of

59
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,420
mobile networks and you can see those

60
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,000
spiderweb graphs here you have on the

61
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,280
left the requirements of the new

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,480
technology the 5g technology and you see

63
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,840
5g does everything well and the gray

64
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,609
area is the comparison with the 4G so

65
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm not going to go through all of the

66
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,970
elements here in this graph but you can

67
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,360
see some of the things that are widely

68
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:18,820
advertised for 5g such as lower latency

69
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,570
we're aiming at possibly a 1 millisecond

70
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:25,720
latency end-to-end very high data rates

71
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,840
so both for peak data rates and maintain

72
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,239
data rates one of the important things

73
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,310
when we talk about radio is the spectral

74
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,310
efficiency so spectral efficiency means

75
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,799
how many bits you can crank into the

76
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,090
same radio channel that's essentially

77
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,070
what it means and we were obviously

78
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,700
always trying to put more bits into the

79
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:47,739
same spectrum so in that sense 5g aims

80
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,140
to have a little bit around three times

81
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,299
through two and a half to three times

82
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,750
more bits in the same spectrum when

83
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,790
compared to 4G and the big question is

84
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,829
what do you do with all of that right so

85
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,780
what is the application is there a

86
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:04,329
killer application is there a reason why

87
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:06,340
you actually won all of these so ITU

88
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:09,400
went ahead and put the graph on the

89
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:12,430
right specifying the technology for

90
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,950
three main use cases and whenever you

91
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,840
read this even the standards for for 5g

92
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,599
you were gonna see all of those three

93
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:21,700
used cases there you see enhanced mobile

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,600
broadband as one which is very fast

95
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:28,180
broadband you see massive machine type

96
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,880
communications or IOT so basically the

97
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,470
ability to connect many more many more

98
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,960
IOT devices in an easier manner

99
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,550
in the network and also low latency

100
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,599
communications ultra reliable and low

101
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:46,130
latency so that's another application

102
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:48,710
now before going into 5g let's do a

103
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,719
quick recap on 4G because I realize many

104
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,359
people here might not be aware of how a

105
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,330
mobile network is laid out in terms of

106
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,790
the main elements so in a 4G network you

107
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:02,000
have the radio which is called the e

108
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:04,610
node B so the you know B is what sits in

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,160
the towers then daddy node B is

110
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:09,560
connected to two main elements one is

111
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,380
called the Mme the mobility management

112
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,450
entity so mobility management entity is

113
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,180
the one who does the authentication so

114
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:19,070
it works with the subscriber database it

115
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,770
does all the mobility management meaning

116
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:23,480
that whenever you move between cells

117
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:26,000
it's the the element that controls that

118
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,740
mobility and it also does a lot of

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,480
session management session management

120
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:32,420
meaning anytime you need to transmit

121
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:36,110
something and establish flows across the

122
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,730
network it helps you set that up then we

123
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:39,590
have these serving gateways so the

124
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,900
serving gateway is the mobility Anchor

125
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,260
Point on a mobile network so that means

126
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,179
that whenever you move in a wide

127
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,370
geographical area you might change your

128
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,790
serving gateway because that's what

129
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,430
keeps the hierarchy - to give you the

130
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:57,410
ability to move around basically it does

131
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,260
packet forwarding it sits on the user

132
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:04,160
plane and it also participates on the

133
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:07,820
session management and the 4G core as we

134
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,130
say it has a dual element approach for

135
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,719
the user plain so we have both the

136
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,630
serving gateway which is the mobility

137
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,840
anchor and the PDN gateway which is

138
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:20,120
actually the IP anchor so that's for

139
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,849
folks have who worked with the wireline

140
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,770
that's maybe similar to a bng concept so

141
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,140
that's where you actually have your IP

142
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:29,950
pools you terminate your user sessions

143
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,310
and you need to connect to the internet

144
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:36,770
the EP gateway the pdn gateway is also

145
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,140
the element that interfaces with a lot

146
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,479
of adjacent systems in a mobile networks

147
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,460
such as policy charging and so on and so

148
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:45,260
forth so there's a pretty complex

149
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,500
control plane involved here to make sure

150
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:50,099
everything works

151
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,130
now in terms of IP networking what does

152
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,320
that look like so the network that

153
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,710
interconnects all of these in Obi's all

154
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:01,110
of those radios to the core is typically

155
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,729
known as the backhaul network right so

156
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,530
whenever you hear back all it's whatever

157
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:07,770
is interconnecting the radios to the

158
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,869
core and here you have some of the

159
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,510
protocol stacks that are used on those

160
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:15,360
mobile networks so for the control plane

161
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:17,520
there's an interface and by the way it

162
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,050
went 3 GPP says interface it's really a

163
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,210
reference point it's a kind of a

164
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,620
protocol between two elements that's

165
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,549
what they mean by interface is not a

166
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,970
physical interface or report so for the

167
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,060
control plane the mobile networks use IP

168
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:34,890
and setp on top of it with the control

169
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,830
protocol being as 1ap

170
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:40,110
so that's the control protocol that we

171
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:43,950
have between the radios and the mms and

172
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:47,669
then for the user plane we have gtp you

173
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:50,760
so GPRS tunneling protocol so it's a UDP

174
00:07:47,669 --> 00:07:52,890
type encapsulation where the radio

175
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:55,980
encapsulates all of the user traffic so

176
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,320
you see the IP in darker gray here those

177
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,990
are the user frames getting capsulated

178
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,240
introduced GTP tunnel that goes all the

179
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,250
way from the a node b passes through the

180
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,260
serving gateway and and at the P gateway

181
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,940
so the P gateway will remove that

182
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:10,590
encapsulation do all the subscriber

183
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,940
management functions and deliver the IP

184
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,239
packet to the Internet

185
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:18,240
now we also have a mix controlling user

186
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,720
playing traffic which is called X 2 so

187
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,490
the X 2 interface is actually meant for

188
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,700
handoff so whenever you're moving

189
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,560
between different radios you have to

190
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,810
coordinate that movement across those

191
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,839
radios and off and also it serves to

192
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,820
send some packets in the user plane why

193
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,409
are you still doing movement so there's

194
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:39,900
a little bit of user plain on that very

195
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:41,700
quick but mostly control playing for

196
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,588
radio coordination and that radio

197
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,360
coordination you see it becomes very

198
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:46,950
important when we go to Dancer

199
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,950
environments I'm gonna talk about that

200
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:52,620
later the other element that I wanted to

201
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:54,480
mention is that because mobile networks

202
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,270
allow you to move between different

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,459
radios you actually need to have those

204
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,040
radios synchronized so they're

205
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:02,109
synchronous

206
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:04,089
going on between all of these radios and

207
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,660
you see here there's different methods

208
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:09,670
for synchronizing those radios many of

209
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:13,689
these radios use ntp actually for

210
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:16,410
synchronization but you can also use GPS

211
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,089
so GPS is very used as another

212
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,579
technology that is widely deployed many

213
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:25,060
of these radios but we can also use

214
00:09:21,579 --> 00:09:28,359
synchronous internet or 1588 to

215
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:29,619
synchronize these radios as well so that

216
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,199
that is another requirement that

217
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,850
typically we run through either through

218
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:38,829
this backhaul network into in terms of

219
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:41,440
sinky or 1588 or NTP or if you have GPS

220
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:47,079
typically you have one GPS / / antenna

221
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:52,449
or / tower now when we look at 5g this

222
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:56,109
is the simplified view of a 5g core 5g

223
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:58,449
has some interesting concepts when when

224
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,360
it was designed so one of the concepts

225
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:04,719
was to have orthogonality of functions

226
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,199
meaning that every function or every

227
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,600
node defining the 5g core performs only

228
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:15,219
one type of function or only one type of

229
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:17,800
of management inside the core what that

230
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,110
means is for example we have the AMF

231
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,469
which is the access and mobility

232
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,839
management function so that only does

233
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,490
mobility management if you compare for

234
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,740
example with the MA mean before in the

235
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,290
40 core DM ami did both mobility

236
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,870
management and session management now in

237
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,880
the 5g course session management is the

238
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,760
responsibility of the SMS so session

239
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,069
management function and those two

240
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,750
elements are pretty much what we have in

241
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:48,939
terms of control plane for a 5g core the

242
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:52,120
key characteristic of the 5g core is

243
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:54,040
that it also came with a clear

244
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,189
separation between controlling user

245
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,959
playing so you see in the bottom we have

246
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:02,079
the radio and by the way it's called G

247
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,508
note B and the the furthest I couldn't

248
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,989
try to understand why G it's because

249
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:11,260
it's new generation radio so go figure

250
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:12,160
but the G note B which is the radio

251
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,889
connects to

252
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,670
a single element in the user plane which

253
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:20,620
is called the UPS user plane function

254
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,649
the biggest change with the five gene

255
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,449
terms of user plane is that apart from

256
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,459
having a single element and we don't

257
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:31,300
have any more ask a 2mp gateway so we

258
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:34,410
only have a user plane element this user

259
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,849
plane element can either be very

260
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,949
distributed so you can have your

261
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,439
internet offload point closer to the

262
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:43,779
user being the content cache or even

263
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,439
even going directly to the internet or

264
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:49,779
you could have a centralized control

265
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:51,730
user plane as well so that centralized

266
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:53,350
user plane serves for more like

267
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,959
centralized peering points and you can

268
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,149
actually have both that's something new

269
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:02,079
now you can have multiple IP anchor

270
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:04,540
points across across your your network

271
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,810
your only obviously going to announce

272
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,240
your IP pools in one side but it gives

273
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,160
you the ability to install some for

274
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,779
example content caches and do local

275
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,000
breakout for specific applications

276
00:12:13,779 --> 00:12:17,439
closer to the user I'm not going to go

277
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,990
through that if there's enough interest

278
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:22,829
we could even do another presentation on

279
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:25,660
how that works but the the other

280
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:27,670
characteristic that I will I think it's

281
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:29,680
worth mentioning is that since we

282
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,029
separated completely the user plain

283
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,089
functions and the session management

284
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:38,860
functions that created a nasty end type

285
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:42,069
of scenario where the SMF acts just like

286
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:44,019
a Sdn controller to program the user

287
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:46,509
plane functions that are actually

288
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:49,389
forwarding packets right so you we have

289
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:50,740
this end 4 interface here or n 4

290
00:12:49,389 --> 00:12:53,290
protocol which I'm going to show you in

291
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,410
the next slide so basically what it's

292
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:58,839
doing is the SMF has once it needs to

293
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:01,089
set up some flows somebody wants to

294
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,000
access the internet for doing Facebook

295
00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:05,829
or whatever it will go ahead and program

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,319
those flows in the user plane functions

297
00:13:05,829 --> 00:13:13,508
so it's pretty much like an SDN type of

298
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:16,420
environment now how does the protocol

299
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:19,509
stacks look like so from a backhaul

300
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,399
perspective there's not a lot of changes

301
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:23,430
comparing to 4G there's actually no

302
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,019
changes in terms of protocol stack

303
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,859
because the user plane is - you're using

304
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:32,379
pee-yew the control plan is to using

305
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,929
setp obviously there's a new control

306
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:39,759
protocol there which is called mg and g

307
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:42,519
AP and we still have that X interface in

308
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,439
this case is not x2 anymore but it's X

309
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,410
and between the different radios for

310
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:49,629
better coordination and handoff there

311
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:52,238
are though a few differences here that

312
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:55,749
you can start to see one of them is that

313
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:58,299
the control plane elements in this case

314
00:13:55,749 --> 00:14:00,869
the AMF SMF and as a matter of fact any

315
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:04,720
other control plane element in a 5g core

316
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:07,749
doesn't use gtp C or diameter anymore so

317
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,939
the two most used protocols in a control

318
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:13,509
plane for 4G networks are the diameter

319
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:16,509
and gtp C gtp control so it's an

320
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:21,249
extensible protocol for sending control

321
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:24,220
information 5g is now based on restful

322
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:28,179
interfaces so all of the 5g core

323
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,459
elements that sit in the control plane

324
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:33,610
they can talk to each other using

325
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:36,099
restful interfaces and we also have a

326
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:38,170
new model which is called the services

327
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,540
based architecture where we get rid of

328
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:43,029
all these peer-to-peer or point-to-point

329
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,129
interfaces between any two elements and

330
00:14:43,029 --> 00:14:48,850
create a kind of a buzz infrastructure

331
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:51,249
in a publisher and consumer model where

332
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:53,499
any of the these functions can publish

333
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:55,629
their own api's and any other function

334
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:58,749
can go ahead and consume those api's as

335
00:14:55,629 --> 00:15:02,019
you need so that that is a pretty good

336
00:14:58,749 --> 00:15:04,980
news because it facilitates reusability

337
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:09,040
of all of these functions and makes

338
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:10,389
standardization much easier and then the

339
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,118
other thing that I wanted to mention

340
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,549
here is the n4 interface as I mentioned

341
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:18,459
this is very much similar to an SDN type

342
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:22,089
of scenario where the asset SMF programs

343
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:25,540
flows in the UPF and the protocol used

344
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:28,059
for that is very similar to GT PC so

345
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,399
actually 3gpp looked at many control

346
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:33,429
protocols for Sdn as alternatives and I

347
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,459
finally decided to reuse GT PC and

348
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:38,709
create something called the PFC P it's

349
00:15:36,459 --> 00:15:39,489
packet forwarding control protocol so

350
00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:41,800
basic

351
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,670
what it does is it sends flow

352
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:47,740
descriptors to to the UPF and with those

353
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,868
flows descriptors it can send some

354
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:52,990
specific actions to do with those flows

355
00:15:49,869 --> 00:15:57,660
right so very similar to what we already

356
00:15:52,990 --> 00:16:01,629
know is the concept of Sdn now is that

357
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:05,469
all so is is it really just same thing

358
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:08,319
as 4G and 5g the same protocol stack we

359
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:11,170
you know we have some restful interfaces

360
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:12,269
here and an SDN type of scenario well

361
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,279
that's not all

362
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:17,259
there's something that I'm sure you've

363
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:21,339
heard it many times called Network

364
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:24,490
slicing so the concept of slicing a

365
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:28,569
network into virtual ventrical virtual

366
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,550
containers or virtual elements is it's

367
00:16:28,569 --> 00:16:31,479
not new for IP networks so we've been

368
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,868
doing this forever

369
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,670
right so with VLANs with verbs or you

370
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:39,910
pick and choose your technology for

371
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:43,479
doing that the difference here for

372
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,850
network slicing in 5g is basically the

373
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,029
sense that you get this slice now all

374
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:51,850
the way from the cell phone to the core

375
00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:54,160
elements so this means that the cell

376
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:57,220
phone needs to be provisioned for using

377
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:59,559
that slice the radio needs to be

378
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:00,879
provisioned for using that slice you're

379
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:03,999
going to need to provision your

380
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:07,750
transport obviously because now you have

381
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,939
some shared elements and some dedicated

382
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:13,480
elements for each of these slices in the

383
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:16,299
network so the there's a shared element

384
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,760
called the NSSF as the name implies it's

385
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:22,589
a network slice election function it

386
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:26,230
facilitates it helps slice election for

387
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:28,299
different connections and the AMF the

388
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,179
access and mobility function is the one

389
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:33,309
who actually selects the slices for all

390
00:17:31,179 --> 00:17:37,659
of the users in conjunction with the

391
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:40,210
NSSF so that is a common element but the

392
00:17:37,659 --> 00:17:42,190
whole concept of slices which is to

393
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:45,100
create a specific infrastructure to

394
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:49,240
serve a set of uese or a set of self

395
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:52,520
cell phones or terminals demands that

396
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,250
you might need to have some specific fun

397
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:57,470
dedicated for that slice to provide some

398
00:17:55,250 --> 00:18:00,170
specific isolates there are different

399
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,110
across slices so you might have a slice

400
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:05,600
that demands some lower latency you

401
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,340
might have a slice that lowers that

402
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,990
demands some higher throughput or a

403
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,629
combination of both and so on and so

404
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:13,940
forth and at the end of the day what you

405
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:16,040
end up with from an IP perspective it's

406
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,660
basically a classical traffic

407
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,810
engineering problem right so you have

408
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,490
some traffic flows that demand low lanta

409
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,520
see some traffic flows that demand

410
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,010
higher throughput maybe proximity is a

411
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,100
factor so you can think about all of

412
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,320
these variables in terms of providing

413
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,719
SLA s in an IP transport network and

414
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,240
that is nothing different than a traffic

415
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,350
engineering problem right so you can

416
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,060
actually pick and choose your own

417
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:42,830
traffic engineering protocols to do that

418
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,450
you can do it you know centralized with

419
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:46,970
a piece app you can do segment routing

420
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,220
you can do MPLS te so whatever protocol

421
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,640
you know and you want to use there will

422
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,950
be good one thing that might be a little

423
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:58,490
different as we move forward and this is

424
00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:01,220
probably not something exclusive to 5g

425
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:05,450
but it's something that 5g will make

426
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,670
bigger or will make a scale much larger

427
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:11,750
is the fact that all of these elements

428
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,460
that we see here SMF UPF AMF NSSF and so

429
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,130
on and so forth

430
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,400
they're not chassis x' being spoke

431
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,110
hardware their virtual elements so in

432
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,200
other words they're gonna be installed

433
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:26,120
as either a VM or a container based

434
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,700
application sitting on a data center

435
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,409
that needs to go through fabric needs to

436
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,260
go through a data center interconnect

437
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,900
and then now what happens is the is that

438
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,030
you need to extend that traffic

439
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,280
engineering domain inside that data

440
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:43,070
center environment so that is a real

441
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,399
problem that we need to solve there's

442
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:49,129
ways of doing it but the biggest

443
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,460
challenge here is that if you start

444
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,470
building more distributed infrastructure

445
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,330
in terms of the core to get closer to

446
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,130
the user that number of many data

447
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:02,899
centers will be much larger and then

448
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:05,000
cross domain orchestration not only

449
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,840
across the data center the physical

450
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,029
network

451
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,250
but also the radio and the other core

452
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:12,640
elements in a 5g network is going to be

453
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,799
very key to realize this vision of

454
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,289
network slice or network as a service

455
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:23,059
over 5g

456
00:20:17,289 --> 00:20:25,580
okay so is this all that we got for 5g

457
00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:27,678
well actually no there's a little bit

458
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,320
more to it because when we look at

459
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:33,830
building networks for mobile for a

460
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,389
mobile operator or for a radio the radio

461
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,520
is the customer right so we are actually

462
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,350
building a dedicated infrastructure to

463
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,059
serve this customer which is the radio

464
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:44,000
network that needs interconnection to

465
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,770
the core and there's lots of advances in

466
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,409
terms of radio that we need to go

467
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:54,350
through to fully understand the impact

468
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:56,179
of 5g so the key theme for deploying

469
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:58,908
radio and mobile networks is

470
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:01,159
densification the reason why we keep

471
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:03,140
getting all those new technologies and

472
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:06,830
new generations is that we need more and

473
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:09,350
more capacity and denser networks or in

474
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:14,480
other words in a given area put more

475
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:17,029
bits which will mean in some way putting

476
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,770
more radios there now if you start

477
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:20,240
pulling putting more radios into the

478
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,340
same area you need some sort of

479
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,529
coordination you need those radios to

480
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,709
work together and not interfere with

481
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:29,450
each other in such a way that it makes

482
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:32,600
actually quality worse

483
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:36,860
so in those specific cases where you

484
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:40,549
need dense radio networks there was this

485
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:43,809
concept of trying to centralize all the

486
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:46,908
basement processing into a specific node

487
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:49,100
in a way that you can now actually

488
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:50,570
better coordinate all of these radios

489
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,750
out there because they're all being

490
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:56,210
processed from a single point and seeing

491
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:57,710
in the network as a single radio rather

492
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:00,289
than different radios that need to

493
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:03,230
communicate amongst them so this led to

494
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:06,020
a an architecture that is called the

495
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,270
Serie nor centralized ran where you

496
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,700
actually split that radio into two

497
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,799
different elements you have the RH which

498
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,440
is called the remote radio head and you

499
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:19,410
have the BBU which is the baseband unit

500
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,250
so for that to happen we actually

501
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:24,690
we need a protocol in between because

502
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:27,210
basically what we're doing is splitting

503
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,520
that radio into two different elements

504
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,800
and the protocol that was created for

505
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,680
this is called supreme common public

506
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,470
radio interface so sipper is a protocol

507
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,260
that runs over a TDM infrastructure and

508
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:43,260
you can look at sip rebase achill ii you

509
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,530
can think about it as radio samples over

510
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:47,940
fiber RF or over fiber radio frequencies

511
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:53,490
over fiber that's what it is

512
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:55,890
so it has a TDM framing where it sends

513
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,820
some radio samples you see here IQ data

514
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:01,260
it sends some control information when

515
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:03,659
possibly you need to send some control

516
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,810
frames to the radio had I need to risk

517
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,600
reset that and so on and so forth and it

518
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,399
also sends synchronization so remember

519
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,169
that I mentioned that radio must be

520
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,410
synchronized so the antenna must be

521
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,010
synchronized now you have the BBU being

522
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:20,580
synchronized

523
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:22,680
by something probably GPS or NTP or

524
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,740
whatever you have there and you extend

525
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,520
that synchronization link to the RH so

526
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,650
because you're sending some digital

527
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:34,770
radio samples and synchronization across

528
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,770
this fiber you have a very little

529
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:40,740
tolerance for delay variation and it's

530
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:44,100
in the order of magnitude of a few

531
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:46,110
nanoseconds and the other characteristic

532
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,320
is that because we are just sending

533
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:51,810
radio samples the amount of traffic and

534
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,330
the C per interface is constant it's a

535
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:57,270
constant bitrate regardless of the fact

536
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:59,220
that if you have one user connected zero

537
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,470
users or hundred users connected to that

538
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,320
antenna it's always gonna be the same

539
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,600
bandwidth so it's a constant bitrate

540
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,179
full of radio samples and those radio

541
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,879
samples are gonna have user data or not

542
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:13,830
but they need to be there and

543
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,500
synchronizations there so all of the

544
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:20,370
deployments for City today they use some

545
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,730
sort of optical multiplexing either DWDM

546
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:27,770
or CWD a most likely CWDM depending on

547
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:31,110
the distances but very likely CWDM now

548
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:33,320
when we take that concept and start to

549
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:38,389
look at 5g there are a few changes

550
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:41,200
and what are those changes so in m4g

551
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:46,309
most of the radio channels that we use

552
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,020
are typically 20 megahertz wide right so

553
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:50,330
you might have typically 20 megahertz

554
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,700
for downlink and plus 20 megahertz for

555
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,490
uplink or it could even have less than

556
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,799
that maybe five or ten megahertz but

557
00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:03,820
most typical networks will use something

558
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:07,490
alongside those lines in 4G networks we

559
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:10,309
we typically use spectrum or airwaves

560
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:14,210
that are closer to or under three

561
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:18,160
gigahertz so 2.5 gigahertz one point a

562
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:21,410
two point one 700 so there's many many

563
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,740
spectrum used across the world in

564
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:26,840
different parts and different areas and

565
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:30,500
what happens is that in that area of the

566
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,659
spectrum which we can even say su or sub

567
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,760
6 gigahertz we don't have a lot of space

568
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:37,340
for four channels that's why we have

569
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:41,960
claiming a 20 megahertz as typical

570
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:44,389
maximum now 5g change that in the sense

571
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,000
that it allows you to go with much wider

572
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,770
channels meaning that you can have up to

573
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,850
four hundred or even we're talking about

574
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:54,470
800 megahertz channels so the wider the

575
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,360
channel obviously the more bits you can

576
00:25:54,470 --> 00:26:00,679
put into it right so and that's in those

577
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,479
larger radio channels that you're going

578
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:05,840
to be able to achieve the very high

579
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,790
bandwidths that 5g promises but there's

580
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,949
one problem with that is that those

581
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:13,250
larger radio channels are only available

582
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:16,640
in a different area of the spectrum and

583
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:18,620
that's why when ever hear about 5g we

584
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,690
typically hear about millimeter waves so

585
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:24,229
millimeter wave are the areas of the

586
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:25,730
spectrum that sit above 24 gigahertz so

587
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:30,049
what that means is that because we're

588
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:33,080
now using a much much higher frequency

589
00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:36,940
we have a lot more space to put some

590
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:39,889
bits there but that signal propagates

591
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:42,200
much less than the signals in the lower

592
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,929
bands so which means that we're now

593
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,320
going to need a lot more antennas to

594
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:49,350
cover the same area if we

595
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,769
to work on that specific spectrum area

596
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:55,080
and the other technology that 5g brings

597
00:26:52,769 --> 00:26:56,850
to enhance the bandwidth is my mo so my

598
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,070
mo basically is the technique that

599
00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,529
allows you to send multiple multiple

600
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:05,279
times the same signal it's gonna reflect

601
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:07,049
in different obstacles and the cellphone

602
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,590
is actually gonna have multiple antennas

603
00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:13,529
and combine all of those signals to

604
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:15,178
enhance the signal strength or in

605
00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:17,159
technical terms enhance the

606
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,230
signal-to-noise ratio so that it can

607
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:21,840
actually have better quality and higher

608
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:24,570
throughputs so if we take all of that

609
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:29,009
and the promising speeds that we have a

610
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:31,168
10 times increase compared to 4G we

611
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:35,039
start to see a little problem with

612
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:37,350
supreme so the typical antenna and

613
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,408
slippery with a 20 megahertz channel

614
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:42,539
will carry roughly 1 Giga bits of

615
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:45,570
traffic 1 gigabits per second in that

616
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:47,220
front hall link right so front hall is

617
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,450
the area between the BBU

618
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:53,100
and the RH so that front hall interface

619
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:56,159
that is this new area created by the

620
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:59,580
centralization of processing of the

621
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:02,970
radios will have traffic dependent on

622
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:04,559
the amount of channel white or the width

623
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,019
of the channel and the number of

624
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,450
antennas so if you have 1 gigabits per

625
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:11,730
second for every antenna and 20

626
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:13,379
megahertz channel if you start

627
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:17,970
increasing the number of antennas some

628
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:21,809
4G antennas have 4 or 4G rages have four

629
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:24,720
antennas you can get to about 4 gigs if

630
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:26,908
you start putting mimal on top of it

631
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,460
which is multiple antennas like 64

632
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:32,100
antennas and that is available today you

633
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,919
can possibly get to 64 gigs per second

634
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:36,750
but now if you go to 5g which is looking

635
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:39,899
at a hundred megahertz channel or even

636
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:43,769
800 megahertz channel you can go upwards

637
00:28:39,899 --> 00:28:46,620
of 300 or even further 320 gigabits per

638
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:49,620
second now anything that you do

639
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,479
regardless of the technology you use 320

640
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,399
gigabits per second is a very expensive

641
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,769
technology right so it's not cheap and

642
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:58,709
if you think that you need to put one of

643
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,620
these links to each and every radio in

644
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,120
your network

645
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,120
you're suddenly gonna realize that

646
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:06,639
that's just not cost-effective that

647
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,489
doesn't doesn't doesn't close the

648
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,880
business case right so it's very

649
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:15,490
apparent and you can see that for 5g we

650
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,140
need to start changing the radio

651
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:18,700
infrastructure for those denser

652
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,669
deployments because that slippery

653
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,120
interface that front-hall interface that

654
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:27,700
exists today just doesn't fit 5g now

655
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,149
many standards body started looking at

656
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:34,419
this problem 3gpp being domain standards

657
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:37,270
body that standardizes all of the

658
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:39,880
technologies for 5g but we also have

659
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,158
other standards body looking at this

660
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,720
problem so one of them is I Triple E so

661
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,899
I Triple E came up with a standard

662
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,919
called 802 the 1 cm or many-colored by

663
00:29:46,899 --> 00:29:53,408
TSN time sensitive network so that is a

664
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,100
new standard for Ethernet based type of

665
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:55,750
front halt

666
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,789
I'm going to talk about it in a bit and

667
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:01,149
there's actually two other working

668
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:03,129
groups at I Triple E called the

669
00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:06,729
next-generation front hall interface

670
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:08,409
19:14 dot one which looks at basically

671
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:13,210
the requirements for front hall over

672
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:15,870
packet networks and 19143 which looks at

673
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:19,270
how to encapsulate all of those cypriot

674
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:21,039
signals into Ethernet into packet based

675
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:24,340
networks as well

676
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:28,658
Seabury which is actually a consortium

677
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:30,699
of many companies including Nokia came

678
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:33,039
up with a new specification for the

679
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:36,250
protocol so there's now a sipper which

680
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:39,070
is Ethernet cypriot name implies how you

681
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:41,620
transmit cipriani thirat link and i'm

682
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:46,450
gonna show that you in a second and

683
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:48,820
there's also math the math has it it

684
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:51,460
standardized the requirements for

685
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:54,490
different types of traffic or different

686
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:56,950
types of services over a a packet

687
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:59,169
Network a Metro Ethernet path work it is

688
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:01,779
also working on specifications for front

689
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:03,760
hall and there's many other centers

690
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:05,679
bodying working on that such as iran

691
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,580
that is looking at how to have

692
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,350
interoperability of slippery or easy pre

693
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:13,090
links those mouse or foramen cessful

694
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,070
working on some different

695
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:19,090
and so and so forth so there's lots of

696
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:20,740
activity in this area now in order for

697
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:23,799
us to address that problem with the

698
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:27,730
front hall bandwidth we need to look a

699
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:29,320
little bit into the radio protocol split

700
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:31,629
so I'm not going to go through all of

701
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:34,059
the details but on the top here you have

702
00:31:31,629 --> 00:31:36,820
the IP packet that you need to transmit

703
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:38,379
to the to the cell phone and in the

704
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,249
bottom you have the antenna on the

705
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:41,980
physical antenna

706
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:44,919
DRF and you have all of these protocols

707
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:49,509
in between layer 1 layer 2 encapsulation

708
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:54,970
right so the way we look at it is that

709
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:57,820
as you move from the IP to drf your

710
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,499
bandwidth increases and why is that

711
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,570
because you're getting actually more

712
00:31:59,499 --> 00:32:04,749
encapsulations and more redundancy right

713
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:08,439
so you're actually trying to code to to

714
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:10,210
give you some protection for errors for

715
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,100
retransmission ins and so on and so

716
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:14,830
forth so as you move down the stack

717
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:18,869
you're gonna have more bandwidth but as

718
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:24,460
you move down the stack you also have a

719
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:26,379
lower latency tolerance right because if

720
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:28,240
you look at an IP packet what is the

721
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:30,369
latency tolerance for an IP packet it's

722
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,860
anything right you can see are no

723
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:35,350
seconds but what is the latency

724
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:38,258
tolerance for a clocking signal on a

725
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:40,418
radio it's very little right so once you

726
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:43,690
get to the RF your latency tolerance

727
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:46,149
starts to be very little so the way to

728
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:47,919
look at it is that with the SIP protocol

729
00:32:46,149 --> 00:32:51,789
we're actually splitting the radio

730
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,340
between the fire and the RF so that is

731
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:55,869
possibly the worst place in terms of

732
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,809
latency tolerance because it's the

733
00:32:55,869 --> 00:33:00,789
smallest latency tolerance and possibly

734
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:02,918
the worst place as well from a bandwidth

735
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:04,179
perspective because you have all the

736
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,600
encapsulations there already

737
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:09,940
right so it's where you have the most

738
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,779
bandwidth and the minimal latency

739
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:15,399
tolerance so the way 3gpp looked at and

740
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:17,889
you see different options those are the

741
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:20,830
options that were studied is actually

742
00:33:17,889 --> 00:33:23,189
with 5g we now need a different approach

743
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:26,740
we need two different splits

744
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:29,260
we need a lower split which many times

745
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:32,230
is referred to as a real-time split and

746
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,270
we have a higher layer split which is

747
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:37,809
sometimes referred as a non real-time

748
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:42,190
split and the way it's done is such that

749
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:44,980
everything now between the low layer and

750
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,860
the high layer is encompasses all the

751
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,660
real-time functions over radio and

752
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,879
everything on the top encompasses the no

753
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,679
real-time functions of the radio right

754
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,100
so basically what we're trying to do is

755
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,990
trying to get a better latency tolerance

756
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,439
a little less bandwidth in front home

757
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:04,360
and also the ability to have a non

758
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,420
real-time element where we can deploy

759
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,489
that more flexibly so when we put that

760
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,760
all together we come to this

761
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:15,520
architecture where actually a GNote ba

762
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,850
5g radio is actually now composed of

763
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,699
three different elements right so we

764
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:25,179
have now the Ru which is the radio unit

765
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:26,949
the Ru has the RF layer but it also it's

766
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:29,050
also a little bit more intelligent than

767
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:31,239
the typical remote radio had that we had

768
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,950
in 40 because it has a little bit of the

769
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,888
five processing on that we're on that

770
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:37,989
radio unit we have the D U which is the

771
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:40,270
distributed unit that does all the

772
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:42,609
real-time processing of the radio and

773
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:45,129
now we have another unit which is called

774
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:47,859
a centralized unit that does all the non

775
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:51,190
real-time processing of that radio now

776
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:53,739
because the Cu processes things that are

777
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:56,168
no real time it allows you to actually

778
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:59,200
use a virtual form factor so we have a

779
00:34:56,168 --> 00:35:01,480
VM type of deployment a virtualized type

780
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,419
of deployment for that Cu and that's why

781
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,000
many times when you look at the 5g radio

782
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:10,180
you think about it or it's referred to

783
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,770
as a cloud Ram because now you have some

784
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,930
elements that can be installed in a

785
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:15,880
cloud right in a virtualized form factor

786
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:17,980
and also some elements that are going to

787
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,520
be physical or bespoke type chassis that

788
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:24,490
process the real time now if we take

789
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,530
those three elements we now have not

790
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,979
only the backhaul which already had and

791
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,780
we talked about here we had the front

792
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:33,880
hall which already talked about as well

793
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,010
but we actually create a new area in the

794
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,170
network called the mid hall and the mid

795
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,170
hall is what sits between the D U and

796
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,210
the see you

797
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,640
so let's start to take a closer look at

798
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:46,039
that so the mid hall interface what is

799
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:48,799
it at the end of the day the mid Hall

800
00:35:46,039 --> 00:35:51,200
protocol stacks are very very similar or

801
00:35:48,799 --> 00:35:53,119
actually the same as the back hall so

802
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,460
you see the user plane is encapsulated

803
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:58,400
in GT PU the control plane is

804
00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,410
encapsulated in SCTP and you can

805
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,210
actually have it's optional but you can

806
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:05,210
actually have a separation of control

807
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:09,380
and user plane for the for the D for the

808
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:13,069
Cu sorry so if you do that you actually

809
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:16,190
have an action additional extra control

810
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:18,170
protocol which is called a1 and that the

811
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:21,319
mead hall interfaces are called f1 by

812
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:24,619
3gpp right so at the end of the day main

813
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:28,180
hall is nothing similar as nothing

814
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:30,769
different sorry form front hall the only

815
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,348
really difference here is that the user

816
00:36:30,769 --> 00:36:35,808
plane packets are not IP because

817
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:38,900
remember again this is an intra radio

818
00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:41,359
interface and we have IP encapsulated

819
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,740
into AP DCP protocol here in the user

820
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:45,470
plane but other than that it's pretty

821
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,410
much the same IP network same IP

822
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:51,288
requirements it's good old IP networking

823
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:53,538
right now

824
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:56,990
what about front hall so front hall in

825
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:59,059
5g uses the EC pre protocol and not the

826
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,979
Cyprian e more so what is the EC pre

827
00:36:59,059 --> 00:37:03,829
protocol it's basically it the

828
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:07,329
adaptation of the SIP protocol for using

829
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:09,920
Ethernet networks now you have here the

830
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:12,140
ethernet network I put there the eater

831
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,359
type you can use VLANs you can use 802

832
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:17,808
the 1p so anything that you know and use

833
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:20,690
today for for Ethernet it still applies

834
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:23,779
for for easy pre you have an optional IP

835
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:25,640
layer with UDP many of the

836
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:27,589
implementations are gonna use IP because

837
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,299
it's obviously much easier to remember

838
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:31,308
and configure IP addresses than MAC

839
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:34,099
addresses between many elements in the

840
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:36,740
network so IP is optional but will

841
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:39,740
probably be there and then you have a

842
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:42,049
single ECP protocol header and this

843
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:45,140
protocol header carries all the

844
00:37:42,049 --> 00:37:47,630
information that the CP protocol needs

845
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:50,598
so basically all the radio samples which

846
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:52,770
are user data the real-time control and

847
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:54,480
some other services

848
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,100
for example remote access to the radio

849
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,810
if you want to update the software for

850
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,910
the radio you have a channel if you want

851
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:02,490
to reset the radio you can do that and

852
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:05,190
so on and so forth now one of the things

853
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:08,779
that is different and it's key to

854
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:11,730
understand is that ISA pre doesn't carry

855
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:14,130
synchronization if you remember one of

856
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:15,930
the key characteristics of Zipporah is

857
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,560
that it used to carry synchronization

858
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:21,629
and ec pre doesn't so whenever you do EC

859
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,029
pre front hall we need to provide

860
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,680
synchronization external to the SIP

861
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:29,460
protocol and that is typically done

862
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,759
through the typical packet based or

863
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:36,510
physical Ethernet type for

864
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:38,880
synchronization like sync e and PTP one

865
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:44,600
thing that I wanted to mention is that

866
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:48,860
the five G radio uses a duplex type of

867
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:53,430
technique which is called TDD so time

868
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:57,240
time now duplex and what it does is that

869
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:59,339
it instead of using a single chunk of

870
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,410
spectrum or a channel for uplink and

871
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:04,470
another channel for downlink what

872
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:06,990
happens is that you use a single chunk

873
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,250
of spectrum and you split logically what

874
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:10,979
do you want to use for downlink and

875
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:13,560
uplink because it's a time division

876
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:17,370
duplex type of characteristic and not a

877
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:20,009
frequency division duplex you now need

878
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:24,330
time and phase synchronization for 5g so

879
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:26,550
that is mandatory in 4G time and phase

880
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:29,220
can be also mandatory if you use some

881
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:32,000
specific techniques like TD away for

882
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,200
specific increasing the precision on

883
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,450
localization of users on location based

884
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,490
services in the u.s. that is very much

885
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:42,089
used in Canada it's not for example in

886
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:43,890
other countries it's not so you might

887
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,440
get away with just frequency

888
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:49,470
synchronization for 4G but not for 5g

889
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:55,320
for 5g will require time and phase

890
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:56,430
synchronization now how how is EC pre

891
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,940
better than Cyprien

892
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:02,609
so this is a scenario assumptions that

893
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,260
you have here 100 megahertz and a bye

894
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:05,550
for my mo and so on so forth I'm not

895
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,270
going to go through all the radio

896
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,090
characters

897
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:12,990
here but when we compared that specific

898
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:16,260
radio scenario when we would have 236

899
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:18,990
gigs with a slippery interface an easy

900
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:21,930
pre interface will give us roughly 20

901
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:23,520
gigs in terms of user plane and tank

902
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,310
it's less than 10 gigs in terms of

903
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,680
control plane right so you see a huge

904
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:31,500
bandwidth reduction here by the order of

905
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,140
magnitude of 10 times when comparing CP

906
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:36,480
2 is debris apart from the fact that now

907
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:41,359
we see pre can be carried over a typical

908
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Ethernet link now 20 is bigger than 10

909
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:48,950
right so that means that when we use

910
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,619
front-hall interfaces for 5g 25 gig e

911
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:54,270
interfaces are gonna be very common and

912
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:56,790
if you think about it 25 gig e

913
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:59,130
interfaces have been mostly used so far

914
00:40:56,790 --> 00:41:01,279
for server infrastructure and not for

915
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:04,590
carrier infrastructure so that's why

916
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,050
whenever you think about Ethernet front

917
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:09,119
hall you better start thinking about how

918
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:11,070
you're going to incorporate 5g Ethernet

919
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,990
transport into your network because 5g

920
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:17,580
will require 25 gig interfaces right and

921
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:20,189
this is specifically for the front hall

922
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,630
for the meet hall for the time being I

923
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:25,859
think 10 gig is gonna be good

924
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:27,720
until we actually go to to higher radio

925
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:29,160
channels and in that case the millimeter

926
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,868
wave we might need some higher

927
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,970
interfaces or higher than tanking now

928
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:40,350
what about latency so I mentioned that

929
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:41,879
latency is actually a key a key

930
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:45,210
characteristic here because we're

931
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:48,119
talking about intra radio interfaces so

932
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:51,180
these are the values standardized by the

933
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:54,600
ECP are recommended by EC pre in 1914 or

934
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:55,770
1 and is actually mentioned in a TSN 802

935
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:59,160
though 1 cm as well

936
00:41:55,770 --> 00:42:01,430
so from the Ru and the D u perspective

937
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:06,480
you have a one-way latency of a hundred

938
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:09,629
microseconds right so that means that if

939
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,480
you consider that a fiber the light and

940
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:15,150
the fiber travels at five microsecond

941
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,780
per kilometer that gives you that gives

942
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:19,460
you around 20 kilometers from the D u to

943
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,670
the area

944
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:25,280
apologize I'm from Canada but it's about

945
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:29,840
12 miles if we convert that right

946
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:34,160
so these Layton sees now start to have a

947
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:36,140
very large impact on where on where we

948
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,170
could place all of these elements in our

949
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:41,750
network right because if we have a radio

950
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:45,950
tower this means that if I'm gonna use

951
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:50,000
this D you and Cu elements a distributed

952
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:52,399
radio architecture my D you must be

953
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,040
within 20 kilometers and that 20

954
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,770
kilometers or that 100 micro second

955
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,950
needs to take into consideration not

956
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:07,310
only the fiber which is valid for both

957
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:10,069
typical typical paths and also protected

958
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:13,520
paths especially if you use rings but

959
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:15,320
also for the for the latency introduced

960
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,490
by any switching elements in the middle

961
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:22,520
right so if you consider that maybe if

962
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:26,629
any any switch with a few decent

963
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,160
features will introduce roughly a few

964
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,830
microseconds there maybe five

965
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:32,629
microseconds for each of these switches

966
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,000
that you put in the path you're taking

967
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:38,000
away one kilometer basically right so

968
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,540
you need to be very conscious of latency

969
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:43,940
when you talk about front-hall now from

970
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:47,480
the D you to the see you it's a little

971
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:48,830
bit more relaxed it's in the range of 1

972
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:51,740
millisecond that's the recommendation

973
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:53,090
and you know if you take that into

974
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:56,839
consideration again that is going to

975
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:59,480
translate into 200 kilometers it's worth

976
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:02,360
noting that this is the hard

977
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,610
recommendations from the standards some

978
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,730
radios might implement some more relaxed

979
00:44:04,610 --> 00:44:10,130
timing here for example we've been

980
00:44:07,730 --> 00:44:12,050
working with winter radio guys to make

981
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:14,690
sure that our radios can cope with a

982
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:17,420
little bit more latency than this to

983
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:20,360
allow for larger spans in terms of

984
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,880
distances but anyway this is what what's

985
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:26,120
in the what's in the standards and then

986
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,370
you you start to ask yourself so Hager

987
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:30,770
you mentioned one millisecond latency

988
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:33,319
end to end in the beginning that that

989
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:36,140
was the goal and you just said that the

990
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:38,630
one way latency here between the D U and

991
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:42,469
C U is 1 millisecond so how do you

992
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:45,170
actually achieve 1 millisecond and 5g so

993
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:47,359
in order to achieve 1 millisecond and 5g

994
00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,849
obviously you need a transport network

995
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,089
that allows you to do that right you

996
00:44:49,849 --> 00:44:55,969
need spans short enough to be able to

997
00:44:53,089 --> 00:44:58,609
have one millisecond there and you also

998
00:44:55,969 --> 00:45:01,400
need to place one of the user plane

999
00:44:58,609 --> 00:45:06,619
functions closer to that see you element

1000
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:08,029
and put the content right there so in

1001
00:45:06,619 --> 00:45:10,940
other words you're only going to be able

1002
00:45:08,029 --> 00:45:13,989
to achieve 1 millisecond latency in 5g

1003
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:17,059
if you have a very distributed content

1004
00:45:13,989 --> 00:45:19,190
infrastructure and if your transport

1005
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:21,499
network from the radio perspective

1006
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:25,969
allows that to happen and that latency

1007
00:45:21,499 --> 00:45:28,879
time frame right typically that doesn't

1008
00:45:25,969 --> 00:45:32,299
happen today right so all of the 5g or

1009
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:34,369
even for 4G today core sites they are

1010
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:38,119
very centralized and that adds a lot of

1011
00:45:34,369 --> 00:45:40,549
latency so actually the only way we're

1012
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:43,039
gonna see reduced latency in 5 G's when

1013
00:45:40,549 --> 00:45:44,660
we actually realize that vision of going

1014
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:48,109
into the far edge and distributing

1015
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:50,299
content very closer to the users and

1016
00:45:48,109 --> 00:45:51,949
then you have the backhaul here with 10

1017
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:53,869
milliseconds so there's no hard

1018
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:56,509
requirement in terms of latency for the

1019
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:58,699
backhaul because it's now an interface

1020
00:45:56,509 --> 00:46:02,089
that is outside of the radio so it's not

1021
00:45:58,699 --> 00:46:03,769
any more an intro radio interface so you

1022
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:05,239
can just think about backhaul the way

1023
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:10,189
we've been thinking today there's no

1024
00:46:05,239 --> 00:46:14,539
hard requirements here now a toe to toe

1025
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:17,420
1cm which was created by by Triple E the

1026
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:19,729
time sensitive Network standard looks at

1027
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:23,420
the way in which you can actually use a

1028
00:46:19,729 --> 00:46:24,919
front-hall link and makes that front

1029
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:28,609
hall link with other types of traffic

1030
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:30,619
because the greatest appeal of using

1031
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:32,299
Ethernet for front hall is not only that

1032
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:34,579
you now get to use a packetized

1033
00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:36,769
interface but now you can actually reuse

1034
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:38,569
that fiber for other types of services

1035
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:41,089
to bring more revenue or whatever you

1036
00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:43,609
need to do that right so whenever you

1037
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:47,180
you do that you need to make sure you

1038
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:49,009
have the right QoS policies in place

1039
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:53,120
to make sure that front hall works as as

1040
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:56,990
expected now a toe to toe 1cm looks at

1041
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,970
two profiles to do that or two typical

1042
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:02,149
ways that we could do that the first

1043
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:06,259
profile is called profile a uses just

1044
00:47:02,150 --> 00:47:08,240
strict priority which any decent router

1045
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,460
or switch can do today so we've been

1046
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,160
doing that forever which means that

1047
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:15,890
anytime you get a more a lower priority

1048
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:18,290
traffic or actually a higher priority

1049
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:20,600
traffic you transmit first and lower

1050
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:22,730
priority traffic wait so you have in

1051
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:25,339
your lap the ingress queue where you

1052
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:28,790
have gray with no priority traffic and

1053
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:31,190
blue with the front hall traffic so what

1054
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:32,930
it actually means is that you start

1055
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:35,390
transmitting your frames if you receive

1056
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:37,370
a high priority frame then you put it

1057
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:39,290
into the front of the queue you transmit

1058
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:40,819
that and then once that's empty you

1059
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,650
transmit all the other frames right so

1060
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,650
we do that today all of the equipment's

1061
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:48,440
in place today I would assume support

1062
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:53,270
that that's that's the case for sure for

1063
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:56,030
us but a 2.1 CM introduces something

1064
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:59,450
interesting which is actually valid for

1065
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:01,070
links that are 10 gig or lower so it

1066
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:03,290
introduces the concept of frame

1067
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:06,620
preemption which is something we have

1068
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:11,000
never done in Internet in Ethernet and

1069
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:13,759
it's just a new concept where the idea

1070
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,310
here is to minimize jitter as much as

1071
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,590
possible so the way you do that is you

1072
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:21,049
start transmitting whatever frame you

1073
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:23,600
have there and the moment you receive a

1074
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:26,570
high-priority frame you actually stop

1075
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,580
transmitting that frame you transmit the

1076
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,680
higher priority frame and then once

1077
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:33,529
that's done you resume transmitting the

1078
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:35,930
lower priority frame right so this

1079
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:39,650
applies to links that are 10 gig or less

1080
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:42,410
and as you could imagine this requires a

1081
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:44,360
change in the Mac processing because now

1082
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:46,730
you have to stop transmitting some

1083
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:48,260
frames you have to signal that transmit

1084
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,720
another frame and then resume

1085
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:54,350
transmitting the initial frame and then

1086
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:58,310
rebuild that frame and end up in the Mac

1087
00:48:54,350 --> 00:49:00,440
chip so if you want to deploy that type

1088
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,350
of frame creation capability you need a

1089
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,990
mate

1090
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:07,259
box both ends of the length need to

1091
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:10,470
support that and you see some specific

1092
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,190
front-hall products supporting that but

1093
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:17,310
again this only makes sense and lower

1094
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:19,650
lowered speed links because the

1095
00:49:17,310 --> 00:49:22,980
serialization delays is larger right so

1096
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:24,660
as you move into higher speed links the

1097
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:27,480
serialization delay gets lower and lower

1098
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:30,560
and then the jitter is just it's just

1099
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:34,800
not a fact that anymore by a strict bird

1100
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,240
now synchronization so I'd like to spend

1101
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,640
a couple of minutes talking about

1102
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,049
synchronization because remember that

1103
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:42,330
we're building this network to

1104
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,580
interconnect radios to the core so the

1105
00:49:42,330 --> 00:49:47,279
radio is really our customer here and

1106
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:49,020
because the radio is their customer the

1107
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,040
synchronization requirements are also

1108
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:55,800
driven by what the radio is doing so if

1109
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,960
you're doing you've seen the the table

1110
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:00,540
and in the bottom here the radio

1111
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:03,690
requirements whenever you're doing basic

1112
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:06,750
radio features just typical TDD and you

1113
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:11,120
have some LTE coordination protocols

1114
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:14,730
there you have an absolute time error of

1115
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:18,029
one point one microsecond from all the

1116
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:21,270
way from the grandmaster or the timing

1117
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:23,250
source to the are you to the radio right

1118
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:25,259
so the timing error is the amount of

1119
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:27,240
error that is introduced in the

1120
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,460
synchronization signal all the way from

1121
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,669
the signal from the signal source to the

1122
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:35,760
consumer right so this is a pretty

1123
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:38,970
relaxed type of scenario where you have

1124
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,100
one point one microsecond but as you go

1125
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:44,009
and and this is named category C by the

1126
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:46,110
way but so if you go do some more

1127
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:48,420
advanced scenarios like carrier

1128
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:50,610
aggregation which is the technique where

1129
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,430
you use multiple carriers or multiple

1130
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:56,070
radios to serve a single cell phone and

1131
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,419
if you do inter band that's two

1132
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:59,760
different radios in different bands

1133
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,530
intra band it's two different ranges in

1134
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,260
the same band in the same spectrum as

1135
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:06,600
you move across those those more

1136
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,330
advanced features that require more

1137
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:13,020
coordination between these radios the

1138
00:51:09,330 --> 00:51:14,400
maximum admissible time error lowers so

1139
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:17,250
your tolerance is

1140
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,710
lower and you can see here that it

1141
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,900
becomes not only lower but it becomes

1142
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:24,569
not more absolute all the way from the

1143
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,240
timing source to the consumer to the

1144
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:29,940
destination but now it's an error

1145
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:33,899
between two any two radios that are

1146
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:36,750
serving the same cellphone right so in

1147
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:38,609
other words it becomes a relative time

1148
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:42,569
error difference between two our use

1149
00:51:38,609 --> 00:51:44,640
right there's something else that we

1150
00:51:42,569 --> 00:51:46,970
need to consider because this timing

1151
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:52,288
signal is going to be traversing routers

1152
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:55,319
right and these routers is these routers

1153
00:51:52,289 --> 00:51:57,690
will introduce some time error and in

1154
00:51:55,319 --> 00:52:02,788
the signal now there are some classes

1155
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:06,029
specified by Jie Jie 82-73 - in terms of

1156
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:08,819
the maximum time error introduced by any

1157
00:52:06,029 --> 00:52:10,920
given router and you have here classes a

1158
00:52:08,819 --> 00:52:13,799
B and C so C is actually being

1159
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:16,859
standardized most of the routers sit in

1160
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:19,950
Class A which is plus minus 15

1161
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:22,288
nanoseconds of error introduced many

1162
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:24,990
routers are now in Class B which only

1163
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:27,690
introduces 20 plus minus 20 nanoseconds

1164
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:31,319
and if some routers will come up with

1165
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:33,990
Class C so why is that important that is

1166
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:36,750
important because now the number of hops

1167
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:38,819
that you can traverse all the way from

1168
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:42,059
the timing source to your destination is

1169
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:43,558
going to be a factor of 1 what you're

1170
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:47,039
doing it with the radio in terms of

1171
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:49,190
requirements and to your capabilities of

1172
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,809
your routers so that's what's going to

1173
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:55,049
limit the number of hops in your network

1174
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:57,809
for the timing signals right and all of

1175
00:52:55,049 --> 00:53:00,390
this leads us to two different scenarios

1176
00:52:57,809 --> 00:53:02,880
so if you have a very relaxed

1177
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:04,618
type of time error budget you're

1178
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,490
possibly going to deploy a centralized

1179
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:10,109
Grandmaster with 1588 which is the

1180
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:12,720
protocol that provides us time and phase

1181
00:53:10,109 --> 00:53:14,609
remember that 5g needs Simon phase so

1182
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,740
we're gonna deploy a centralized

1183
00:53:14,609 --> 00:53:20,460
Grandmaster and that Grandmaster will

1184
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:22,709
serve the timing all the way to the D

1185
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,460
you and the are you right so the D you

1186
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:25,390
and the are you are the only

1187
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,700
in the radio that need to be

1188
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:29,710
synchronized remember that Cu doesn't

1189
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,359
perform real-time functions so it

1190
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:35,020
doesn't need to have a synchronization

1191
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:38,440
signal words are timing signals sent to

1192
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:41,070
it now if you have if you move to more

1193
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:46,270
strict type of scenarios where you have

1194
00:53:41,070 --> 00:53:49,359
a more more integrated functions between

1195
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:51,280
two any to any given are use you might

1196
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,759
go to the scenario on the left with a

1197
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,730
more tight budget where you put a GPS in

1198
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:59,470
the deal and the deal actually becomes a

1199
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:01,300
grandmaster - the two are used at its

1200
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:03,640
serving so that you can guarantee that

1201
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,560
that time error is going to be within

1202
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:10,990
bounds for both of these are use

1203
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:14,680
connected there right and the way we do

1204
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:16,660
this is by implementing 8270 5.1 which

1205
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:20,109
is a full timing support meaning that

1206
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:22,629
every hop across the path is gonna

1207
00:54:20,109 --> 00:54:26,200
support timing support boundary clock in

1208
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:29,260
terms of 1588 right and we also

1209
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:32,020
recommend that we use sync II alongside

1210
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:34,119
that path and the reason for using C key

1211
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:36,220
is that sync II provides us with a very

1212
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:38,980
stable frequency base because it's a

1213
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:41,049
physical signal between Ethernet ports

1214
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:45,040
and different boxes so with that

1215
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:47,530
specific table sync key signal we can

1216
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:50,380
build a very stable time and phase

1217
00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:52,960
signal on top of it with 1588 right so

1218
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:59,560
those two protocols work together to

1219
00:54:52,960 --> 00:55:02,109
create a stable timing scenario now to

1220
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:04,960
close what does this all mean so far

1221
00:55:02,109 --> 00:55:07,480
well this all mean that actually

1222
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,550
transport networks for 5g radios could

1223
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:13,690
become quite complex because there's no

1224
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:16,599
one-size-fits-all so these are four

1225
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:20,920
typical deployment scenarios that we

1226
00:55:16,599 --> 00:55:22,869
have in a 5g network and you could have

1227
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:24,550
either the top one where you have the

1228
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:26,349
core and then you have all three

1229
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:29,140
elements deployed in a very

1230
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:32,260
decentralized way so you have the Cu the

1231
00:55:29,140 --> 00:55:34,750
D U and the are you and in that case you

1232
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:35,589
need to create a front-hall a mid halt

1233
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:39,009
and a backhaul

1234
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:40,839
at work always remember that the see you

1235
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:42,489
were typically to see you and the core

1236
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:47,920
will typically see into a data center

1237
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:50,410
right or if you possibly look in e2

1238
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,989
millimeter wave I'm in the mirror wave

1239
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:55,779
as we saw is where you actually have

1240
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:58,210
lots of bandwidth so you might want to

1241
00:55:55,779 --> 00:56:00,700
combine the D you and the are you

1242
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:02,499
because then you avoid having the front

1243
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:05,019
hall traffic which is where the

1244
00:56:02,499 --> 00:56:07,209
bandwidth is most intensive and then for

1245
00:56:05,019 --> 00:56:10,508
those millimeter wave scenarios you only

1246
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:12,670
have mid hall and back hall or you can

1247
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:14,589
actually do some more centralized radio

1248
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:17,140
deployments where you have the Cu and

1249
00:56:14,589 --> 00:56:19,420
the D you combined and you only have the

1250
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,430
are you in the field and with this you

1251
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:23,109
only need backhaul or it need to only

1252
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:26,078
need front hall but you always lead back

1253
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:28,598
home right and the last scenario in the

1254
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,549
bottom is kind of similar to the most

1255
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:33,670
typical distributed fully distributed

1256
00:56:30,549 --> 00:56:37,960
ran where you combine actually DCU the

1257
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:40,239
ru and the D you so with that you only

1258
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:43,690
have backhaul you get rid of mid hall

1259
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:47,440
and front hall and it's very likely that

1260
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:50,049
if you have a network you're gonna have

1261
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,880
all of these scenarios together because

1262
00:56:50,049 --> 00:56:55,569
you're gonna be operating multiple

1263
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:57,400
spectrum but multiple spectrum in areas

1264
00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:59,380
and all of these spectrum areas are

1265
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:02,799
gonna require different radio strategies

1266
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:04,719
so the summary here is that the 5g

1267
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,599
transport networks needs to be built

1268
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:09,489
handing hand between the IP planning

1269
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,349
department and the radio department

1270
00:57:09,489 --> 00:57:13,210
there's no way around it and very likely

1271
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:15,670
you need to support all of this

1272
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:20,469
combination combination of all of these

1273
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:22,269
scenarios at the same time so with that

1274
00:57:20,469 --> 00:57:25,559
our open for questions I think we're a

1275
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:25,558
little bit over time here but

1276
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:39,560
I must west George with my grid two

1277
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:41,740
quick questions one is there a set of

1278
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:45,200
assumptions around all these different

1279
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:48,290
IP layer devices that they're gonna run

1280
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,270
prominently ipv6 only given that you've

1281
00:57:48,290 --> 00:57:53,660
got all these different things that you

1282
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:55,130
you know say order of tens of thousands

1283
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:57,080
of towers with all these different

1284
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:58,580
elements in them there's simply not

1285
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:01,310
enough IP space even for your using

1286
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:02,900
private to make that work so was that it

1287
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:05,090
was that an assumption for from the

1288
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:08,900
beginning so the sender is done don't

1289
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:10,400
specify ipv4 or ipv6 okay if we well you

1290
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,310
can take I'm not gonna go back because

1291
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:14,960
it's by just in the beginning but

1292
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,950
because we use the GTP encapsulation on

1293
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,530
the user play and you're actually

1294
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:19,759
separating the IP packets from the user

1295
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:21,320
from the infrastructure so the

1296
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:24,200
infrastructure could be anything right

1297
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:27,170
and the user could be anything now any

1298
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,759
best practice scenario that you might

1299
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:31,340
think about it if you're building a

1300
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:33,620
network from scratch that's gonna be you

1301
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:37,700
know that that size you might think

1302
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:39,890
about ipv6 the reality is that all of

1303
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,689
the operators already have some sort of

1304
00:58:39,890 --> 00:58:44,720
IP for structure for their existing

1305
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:46,910
towers some rv6 somewhere before right

1306
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:49,459
so at the end of the day it's there's

1307
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:53,029
nothing mandating v6 and operators are

1308
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:55,490
migrating to v6 as they move to as there

1309
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:57,860
are v4 infrastructure exhaust and and

1310
00:58:55,490 --> 00:59:00,169
they implement v6 so there's nothing

1311
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:03,140
mandated but it's something everybody's

1312
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:10,130
doing ok my other question was relating

1313
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:12,170
to MTU there the internet sort of

1314
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:16,190
generally has this artificial limit on

1315
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:17,870
MTU 1500 because of Ethernet I was

1316
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:20,360
curious if there was anything in either

1317
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:23,690
the standard sort of general design

1318
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:26,390
philosophy about what sort of MTU you're

1319
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:29,030
exposing is user payload and then what

1320
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:30,830
that means in terms of the MTU designing

1321
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:33,140
for in the backhaul networks and in all

1322
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:34,580
these different elements especially

1323
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,850
given that the speeds we're talking

1324
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:37,400
about

1325
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:39,410
I must I'm assuming serialization delay

1326
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,230
is less of an issue but you were talking

1327
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,440
about

1328
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:45,540
strict priority and you know you know

1329
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:46,740
Micra second level latency and so maybe

1330
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,270
that's not true I was just curious if

1331
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:51,750
there was there was a discussion on that

1332
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:54,240
sure that's a great question the front

1333
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:56,430
hall actually asked for two thousand

1334
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,279
bytes so that's what's asked for a

1335
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:03,180
minimum in terms of the TSM da toe to

1336
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:05,160
the 1cm MTU because obviously as we saw

1337
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:09,029
there's multiple encapsulations here you

1338
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:12,000
mentioned that so as a as a backhaul

1339
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:15,360
provider you will want to have an MTU

1340
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:19,830
greater than 1500 in order to provide a

1341
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:21,720
1500 MTU to the IP layer which is deep

1342
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:24,120
inside those are all those encapsulation

1343
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:27,930
so that really plays a role and actually

1344
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:31,020
there's there's lots of lots of work

1345
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:33,240
done in mobile networks because you face

1346
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,980
different MT use across the transport

1347
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:37,799
network and the radio and so on and so

1348
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:40,500
forth and that directly affects the MTU

1349
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:42,770
that is sent to the user so that that is

1350
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:50,240
for sure something of consideration

1351
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:54,660
thanks Lydia folk uhe telecom well okay

1352
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:58,919
essentially I started were with the same

1353
01:00:54,660 --> 01:01:05,460
question as well let me follow up on

1354
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:09,360
that our experience over the years of

1355
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:13,920
actual vendor implementation and full

1356
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:18,960
feature feature equivalence between v4

1357
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:22,890
and v6 used and I think even still is in

1358
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,560
some corners a problem is we expect a

1359
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:28,859
ssin that everything that gets the 5g

1360
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:33,560
label and his soul actually will be

1361
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:36,570
doing will be able to fully work in v6

1362
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:39,060
there's no protocol specification in

1363
01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:41,940
terms of equal v6 for 5g and the

1364
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:44,759
standards having said that the question

1365
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:48,060
is what is actually available in the

1366
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:49,280
market right so you can actually today

1367
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:51,740
in 4G

1368
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,170
can actually already get a v6 interface

1369
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:56,870
right so most operators do especially

1370
01:01:54,170 --> 01:02:00,850
for voice for example it's very much

1371
01:01:56,870 --> 01:02:04,400
used so you can get both the v4 and v6

1372
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:06,980
5g is interesting because it also allows

1373
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:10,010
you before and physics before still

1374
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:14,410
there in 5g so if somebody wants to keep

1375
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:18,050
using before you can there's no mandate

1376
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:19,819
support I think for v6 from a packet

1377
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:23,210
court perspective and transport I think

1378
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:25,190
we're pretty good nowadays obviously the

1379
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:28,760
Devils in the details and we need to

1380
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:32,090
take a look at that but again there's

1381
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,290
nothing saying you need to use v4 v6 do

1382
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:34,880
you think that is different though that

1383
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:37,580
I didn't mention that's not in the

1384
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,820
context here is that actually 5g has

1385
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:43,009
Ethernet as a type of framing as well so

1386
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:46,250
the idea of that is that you can

1387
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:48,110
actually in the future integrate other

1388
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:50,990
types of access that are not radio to

1389
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:53,900
a5g4 that's just a good to know but I

1390
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:57,620
mean v6 is gonna be important for sure

1391
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:58,940
yeah well okay and talking about details

1392
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:02,390
with ethernet

1393
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:04,400
of course the nasty details are well

1394
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:09,279
okay you are not talking if a net the

1395
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:15,380
dix specification from 40 years ago and

1396
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:18,470
you are talking 803 and it looks like

1397
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:28,130
very interesting to get 803 to do

1398
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:30,890
anything in MTU beyond 1500 yeah Jay

1399
01:03:28,130 --> 01:03:34,700
Hanigan with impulse as you go to the

1400
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:37,339
millimeter wave frequencies what is the

1401
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:40,279
effective distance or range from a

1402
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:42,050
handheld device that's changing its

1403
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:44,960
orientation so you can't really use any

1404
01:03:42,050 --> 01:03:47,140
gain antennas what what density of cell

1405
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:50,630
sites are you going to need to support a

1406
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:53,690
millimeter wave in terms of the range

1407
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:56,420
between the consumer radio and the

1408
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:58,190
serving cell-site sure that's a great

1409
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:02,540
question and the answer is a few hundred

1410
01:03:58,190 --> 01:04:04,160
meters so you can think that that will

1411
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:06,650
only work in two scenarios for

1412
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:08,629
millimeter-wave the first scenario is

1413
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:11,210
that you're actually not using cell

1414
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:12,890
phones using CP devices with an antenna

1415
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:14,810
there is gonna be put inside a home and

1416
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:17,210
then 10 is gonna be in the roof for

1417
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:19,490
fix-it wireless so that is one scenario

1418
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:22,010
that is gonna be used and the second

1419
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:25,160
scenario is it is actually possible to

1420
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:27,369
use cell phones but it's with small

1421
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:30,020
cells in indoor environments for example

1422
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:32,330
or stadion where you have very large

1423
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:34,940
density so you want to put that small

1424
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:37,160
cell to serve a very small portion of

1425
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:39,980
people or very concentrated number of

1426
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:43,129
people in a given area but we don't

1427
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:44,990
expect to have millimeter wave for

1428
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:49,000
consumer based cell phone type of usage

1429
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:49,000
across a large geographical area

1430
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:55,369
Joe has fest communications we've spent

1431
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:56,660
some time talking about this and one of

1432
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:59,510
the things that came up in our little

1433
01:04:56,660 --> 01:05:01,879
group was the possibility of having user

1434
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:03,920
caching in other words I have a set of

1435
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,900
cars on the freeway not all they

1436
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,540
actually cache the information for other

1437
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:10,280
vehicles has this come up is there any

1438
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:12,859
provision in the standards for it or

1439
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:17,210
what do you think it would work yeah so

1440
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:19,850
there's some work on use cases for

1441
01:05:17,210 --> 01:05:22,130
cellular to vehicle or vehicle to

1442
01:05:19,850 --> 01:05:24,020
vehicle type of communications in 5g

1443
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:26,810
that is that is part of the upcoming

1444
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:28,550
standard so it's it's not being

1445
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:30,830
discussed now so the current standards

1446
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:34,340
as it is that is not that is not

1447
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:39,799
included it's much more in the concept

1448
01:05:34,340 --> 01:05:43,720
of assisted information so I don't think

1449
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:46,910
anybody expects that we will rely on a

1450
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:49,669
5g link to take driving decisions in the

1451
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:52,100
road right so the vehicles are gonna be

1452
01:05:49,670 --> 01:05:54,830
autonomous and things like you know

1453
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:57,859
you're one kilometer from a traffic

1454
01:05:54,830 --> 01:06:00,500
light or there's been an accident and

1455
01:05:57,859 --> 01:06:03,890
maybe there's a fire truck coming and

1456
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:07,130
things like that can be sent across the

1457
01:06:03,890 --> 01:06:10,790
network now when you talk about

1458
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:12,560
specifically the only scenario where you

1459
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:14,900
could do that closer to the user is that

1460
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:17,900
scenario where I mentioned you must have

1461
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:21,440
a user plane function a UPF and the

1462
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:24,380
content sitting right behind that so the

1463
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,780
closest you get is the closest any

1464
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:29,210
operator will deploy that user plane

1465
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:31,010
function today those sites for

1466
01:06:29,210 --> 01:06:33,260
subscriber management in most operators

1467
01:06:31,010 --> 01:06:36,370
are very centralized so it may be have a

1468
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:39,020
handful of those in most large operators

1469
01:06:36,370 --> 01:06:41,870
then it's a question of how aggressive

1470
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:44,210
the operators are gonna be in terms of

1471
01:06:41,870 --> 01:06:45,650
the point that closer to the edge I

1472
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:47,330
don't think it's realistic to expect

1473
01:06:45,650 --> 01:06:49,340
that we're gonna go from a very

1474
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:51,080
centralized architecture today to a

1475
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:53,720
fully distributed flicking a switch

1476
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:56,480
right but I think we'll eventually get

1477
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:58,700
there but what I think I just heard you

1478
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:01,430
say is that right now today content

1479
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:03,259
distribution is is a centralized

1480
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:05,569
function and that's not likely to change

1481
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:07,520
so if I were out there on the edge I

1482
01:07:05,570 --> 01:07:09,050
wouldn't be able to query other sites

1483
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,880
around me I'd have to go back to the

1484
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:13,280
central controller or it's the closest

1485
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:17,360
location of this content thank you very

1486
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:21,420
much good presentation thank you any

1487
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:25,229
more questions not thank you very much

1488
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:25,229
[Applause]

1489
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,140
you
