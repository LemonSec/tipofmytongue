1
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:17,340
and they been a hot topic lately

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,919
and we've we've recently taken the first

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:23,550
step towards working on this stuff and

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,730
we we about almost two weeks ago

5
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:31,680
started dropping all of our rpki and

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:34,050
valid prefixes on our hearing edge so

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,910
I'm gonna skip this slide because we've

8
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:39,269
heard a lot about our PKI and what it is

9
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,339
and kind of how it is and why why it's

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,899
good and some things maybe why it

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,180
doesn't it's not so good so we're gonna

12
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,940
skip that what I really wanted to talk

13
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:52,769
about was kind of what we did and and

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:56,940
how we got to that point so there's a

15
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,430
very basic drawing we we deployed four

16
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,370
instances of the right v3 validator I'm

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,110
in two different locations for instances

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,810
total two in each of the locations

19
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,360
within our network we established the

20
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:11,340
RTR sessions to our peering routers

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,820
those are the IG RS and they have access

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,590
out to the to the world so they can pull

23
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,869
down all the rows and all those fun

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,250
things so this is kind of what we wanted

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,610
to walk through so we first did that

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,700
deployment got the got the Roiz got the

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,549
VR peas going out to the routers so the

28
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,500
routers have that validation state we

29
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,340
did a lot of checks to verify make sure

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,870
everything's consistent everything is

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,549
the routers are seeing all the state and

32
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:46,409
and seeing the same state from all of

33
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:47,940
the all of the RPS out there and and

34
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,820
that they were stable and everything

35
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:52,590
stayed up and was working so and then

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,600
you can at that point would also be a

37
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,420
good time to start integrating some

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,490
other service checks so that you can

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,990
make sure that your your sessions are up

40
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:05,580
like you would do with any new kind of

41
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:07,169
bgp session or policy the next thing we

42
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,508
wanted to do was we wanted to try and

43
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,730
understand how that you know when we

44
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:15,059
take that next step for of dropping the

45
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,920
the invalids how how is that going to

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,360
impact our traffic how much traffic does

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,760
it impact and you know what's it going

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,460
to do am I going to have VP's yelling at

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,850
me at 3:00 in the morning and

50
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:30,050
like that so we didn't have the the

51
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:33,980
fancy new tools that that job had has

52
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:37,720
contributed to to developing with PM

53
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:41,209
acct but which I've linked to down here

54
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,180
so we put in a just a regular policy on

55
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,400
our bgp sessions to apply bgp community

56
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,840
once that bgp community is in place i

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,810
can use my standard net flow analysis

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,800
tools to look at that traffic and and

59
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:56,450
see what what that what that impacts

60
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,290
going to be what traffic matches those

61
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:02,480
those communities we also started

62
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,220
reaching out to several of our peers who

63
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,530
are had customers that are originating

64
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,970
invalid routes and let them know hey you

65
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:08,840
guys have customers that are doing bad

66
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,260
things

67
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,180
and so we were trying to communicate out

68
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,989
that this is going to be an impact at

69
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:20,510
some point one of the gotchas that that

70
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:22,550
the fancy new tools take into account

71
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,190
that we didn't have the opportunity to

72
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,600
to leverage we had to do it manually you

73
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:29,570
have to watch out for things that have

74
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,910
like a valid or an unknown covering

75
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:34,459
aggregate block so even though the more

76
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:36,350
specific might be invalid so you're not

77
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,420
you're not going to lose connectivity to

78
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:41,359
that when we drop those invalid you the

79
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:45,309
the trick is to do the analysis in such

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,780
a way that it's only only impacting the

81
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:51,530
prefixes that you actually are going to

82
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,960
completely lose visibility to we did

83
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,860
take additional step of depressing those

84
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:00,110
invalids it had a little bit of impact

85
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,060
to drop some to decrease some of the

86
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,220
traffic and shift it away to away from

87
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,430
those prefixes but really a lot less

88
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,590
than we expected it's kind of useful to

89
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,660
play with them look at it's not a

90
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,420
long-term solution it doesn't work very

91
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:17,269
well and then the final solution final

92
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:20,899
step is to is to drop those packets or

93
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:24,370
drop those routes coming in which we did

94
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:29,299
a couple weeks ago what happened

95
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:31,010
really it was almost a non-event we we

96
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,680
saw a very little impact to the traffic

97
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:37,699
after doing our analysis it was

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,370
in the hundreds of megabits of traffic

99
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:45,169
that we were expected to drop and that's

100
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:47,990
about what we saw handfuls of trouble

101
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:50,930
reports and I really think that because

102
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,330
the rpki is such an opt-in system that

103
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:56,210
somebody actually had to actively go in

104
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:59,930
and register or OA and and kind of knew

105
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,669
what they were doing then they were when

106
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,880
when they found out that their prefix

107
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,120
wasn't working within 7018 and they was

108
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,460
pointed out hey maybe go check your OA

109
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,020
they they were very it was very easy to

110
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,520
get them to fix it

111
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,169
we didn't get you know lots of

112
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,820
escalations people jumping up and down

113
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,698
screaming hey you broke the internet

114
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:24,169
don't do that anymore

115
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:26,090
so it went was pretty smoothly just a

116
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:30,139
couple of quick observations on what we

117
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:32,388
saw most of the invalid rowers that are

118
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,800
out there it's it really just seems to

119
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:39,349
be very it's mistake driven you know so

120
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,500
far they there hasn't been very much

121
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:45,349
operational impact to getting it wrong

122
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,570
so so it's very easy for those rowers to

123
00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:48,620
fall out of sync with what's actually in

124
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,680
your network what you're actually

125
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:53,120
advertising in some cases we think that

126
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,099
maybe some operators may have

127
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,389
misunderstood what what's supposed to go

128
00:05:55,099 --> 00:06:02,229
into the rower and in in some cases you

129
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:04,669
know they just they maybe somebody

130
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,409
published for their aggregates but maybe

131
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:08,359
didn't publish for what they delegated

132
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:09,919
to customers lots of different potential

133
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,870
reasons these are just kind of what we

134
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,500
thought of what it looked like probably

135
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:19,669
happened seems to have been minimal

136
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:24,550
impact and so we really think everybody

137
00:06:19,669 --> 00:06:26,349
else should let's get this done any

138
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,349
questions

139
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:29,349
please

140
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:36,040
Rolland Davin's NetScaler ver first of

141
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:39,130
all kudos to AT&T and to MTG this has

142
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,230
been fantastic news recently with with

143
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:43,240
the RPK any stuff I notice the lightning

144
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:46,510
talk but could you talk just a little

145
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,510
bit about any significant layer eight

146
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,090
hurdles that you had to go through to

147
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,370
get permission to do this and anything

148
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:56,109
that you think might also other

149
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,700
operators might need to keep in mind as

150
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,120
they start down this path internally

151
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:03,280
yeah so this was really this was our

152
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,950
experience with with what we did we had

153
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,690
to really sit down and do that analysis

154
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:10,420
and see what that traffic is going to

155
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:13,930
look like and and it's really pretty

156
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:16,030
specific to our customer cone and the

157
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:19,270
the network's externally that they would

158
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:21,609
want to be able to communicate with and

159
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:24,099
so they you know the the intersection of

160
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,790
that with the invalid rowers that are

161
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,920
out there seems not to a bit high so you

162
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:31,480
know you have to do the analysis

163
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,030
yourself and and and make that

164
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,400
justification to your own management to

165
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:39,640
to see they you know that it works but

166
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,469
once we laid out you know what what we

167
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,080
expected it to be and we made sure that

168
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,690
we had all the all the things covered to

169
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,700
notify their operation centers so that

170
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,500
if we did get problem reports that

171
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,990
somebody would know how to look up is

172
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,820
this an invalid round prefix or you know

173
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,130
anything like that it was fairly

174
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:02,409
straightforward to get that approval to

175
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:04,630
make that step Don Smith Centrelink

176
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,400
first off when you did the deep rough we

177
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:10,120
would collect a lot of metrics a little

178
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,729
metric serve not many we didn't have a

179
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,520
lot of metrics on that but you know

180
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,070
anecdotally when we made that change

181
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,900
there was very little change in the in

182
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,840
the prefixes for the you know what was

183
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:25,870
the best path very little change in that

184
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,549
respect which makes a lot of sense when

185
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,650
you go back and look at it because most

186
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,380
of the invalids that we were seeing were

187
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:34,600
in fact the longest match and it's clear

188
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,610
that you would have but deep ref you did

189
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,260
was as low as you could go basically

190
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,650
were pretty darn low it was pretty darn

191
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,650
low yeah

192
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:48,180
Doug Montgomery NIST first

193
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:51,089
congratulations ii want to remind

194
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:53,459
everybody to be careful about using the

195
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,770
term invalid role when you really mean

196
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:58,500
invalid rail route because it's our

197
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,740
examiner's of infinite confusion in the

198
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,740
scale

199
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:12,660
anybody else great

200
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,010
you
