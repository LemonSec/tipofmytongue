1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:17,550
is anybody tired no because I see these

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,710
chairs you guys are sitting I'm standing

3
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,890
I don't have a computer in front of me

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:27,029
so I feel pretty make it actually these

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:32,430
things transparent also so it's nothing

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:36,660
to hide okay here she stumbled on the

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,900
keyword unleashing back in December I

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,629
was working proposing the abstract said

9
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:46,379
you have a great topic Jose but just in

10
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,899
case if you get allocated a slot in the

11
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,739
last day in the afternoon you had to

12
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:55,379
have a very intriguing title and I hope

13
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,599
I did to keep you in the room I hope

14
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,099
nobody's being forced to be here and you

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,109
want to hear what I'm gonna have to say

16
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,510
and it is very important because we're

17
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:06,300
bringing traffic engineering to the

18
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,880
masses we have the problem that

19
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:10,800
everybody is trying to solve in a simple

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,130
way some of you are loaded to simplicity

21
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:16,130
a moment ago so let's get going

22
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:23,929
one of the reasons why we're here is

23
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,658
trying to answer almost philosophical

24
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:32,579
questions are there have you ever tried

25
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:35,250
to tell the IGP what to do tell ISAs

26
00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:39,508
tell OSPF what you really wanted and

27
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:44,060
achieve a path that is for you your

28
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:46,710
macro traffic engineer policy or desire

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:50,280
arrive at a destination minimizing the

30
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,210
delay arrival a destination utilizing

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,479
only encrypted links arriving at a

32
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,460
destination that only uses the

33
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,299
high-speed links and leave the others

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:07,288
behind arriving at a destination using

35
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:11,060
only a subset of your topology and not

36
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:17,370
using nodes because for political or

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:19,130
regulation reasons you cannot go and all

38
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,569
of these use cases are available now

39
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,420
this is not your

40
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:27,390
basic segments routing 101 presentation

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,599
make it clear what we are here talking

42
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,719
about the newest member of the segment

43
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,909
routing traffic engineering family

44
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:40,620
her name is SR AGP flexible algorithms

45
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:43,319
so now you know her you're gonna know

46
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,780
her more in the last 25 in the next 25

47
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:51,420
minutes to understand what can you

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,230
accomplish with it so we're going to

49
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,980
break it into three sections

50
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:59,869
overview get everybody excited I hope

51
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:05,790
how he works

52
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:10,310
boring protocol use cases good okay

53
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:12,989
that's those are the three sections now

54
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:17,010
what I mentioned earlier is to really

55
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:18,810
look at SR ITP flexible algorithm as a

56
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,649
segment routing traffic engineering

57
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:25,290
toolkit the newest toolkit but it's one

58
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:28,349
that must not be thought in isolation it

59
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:30,209
needs to come penetrate with everything

60
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,358
else that you have in your segment

61
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:37,310
routing traffic engineering toolkit

62
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:41,879
whether it is TI LFA on-demand policy

63
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:45,959
creation or automated steering this last

64
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,090
two points are key for the newest and

65
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,470
I'm happy to hear that word because he

66
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:55,489
makes sense is intent the ability to

67
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:59,250
have traffic engineer path that put

68
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:06,900
traffic into a an object when it's

69
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:10,829
needed and stop when it's not needed we

70
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:14,489
call them a flex I'll go and why flex is

71
00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:17,340
because you you and you decide what it

72
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:19,918
will do you could have a flex I'll go

73
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,739
where you will indicate to your IDP that

74
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,840
you want to perform path computation to

75
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:31,219
minimize based on a metric I GP or delay

76
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:34,888
you will also tell the IEP to exclude

77
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:38,550
resources based on link affinities or

78
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:41,039
our lg's so you pack this information

79
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,249
the IGP you will see what he will do and

80
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,889
then we'll compute a path to honor your

81
00:04:44,249 --> 00:04:54,240
minimization objective and to honor your

82
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:55,800
constraints what really makes the point

83
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,870
is what's on the slide

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,629
imagine you have a topology with a

85
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,599
routers as shown on the lower left-hand

86
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:07,860
side and you decide that you want to

87
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:12,029
have a red shadow area everybody calls

88
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:14,639
this now a slice I have a network slice

89
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:17,939
that only includes five out of my a

90
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,580
routers and I want my IGP to compute a

91
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:24,750
path to any destination in the slice

92
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:28,229
that minimizes the IGP metric and avoids

93
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:32,719
the brown links what you see in the blue

94
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:32,719
arrow is a representation of such a path

95
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:38,849
who made that call that they wanted to

96
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:41,159
avoid Brown and include only these

97
00:05:38,849 --> 00:05:44,128
routers you made that call the operator

98
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:46,409
did in the next example the same

99
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:47,370
operator or another operator I guess is

100
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,250
the same because it has the same

101
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:53,039
topology it has the same routers in the

102
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:56,219
so called slice but this time he wants

103
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,490
to minimize on the delay to reach the

104
00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:02,969
destination now you see a completely

105
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:07,289
different path to go from node 6 to not

106
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:08,789
for in the violet arrow two completely

107
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,779
different objectives between two

108
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:17,159
destinations and that is what flexible

109
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:23,099
algorithm is trying to do but really the

110
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:25,969
point to bring home is this question how

111
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:29,389
many LEM pls labels were needed to

112
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:35,819
instantiate the blue or the violet arrow

113
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:37,979
and the answer is one label so what

114
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:42,899
we're here it is to introduce the new

115
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:45,568
flex algo seed is a customizable prefix

116
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:48,210
seed that you tell the router what it

117
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,789
means it could mean

118
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,039
to the destination minimizing delay get

119
00:06:50,789 --> 00:06:55,380
to the destination minimizing IGP and

120
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,770
avoiding brown and now with that

121
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:03,479
instruction which is a single label you

122
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,789
realize your traffic engineer path if

123
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:08,520
you read a lot into it and if you read

124
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:12,500
what I wrote I'm doing a SR traffic

125
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:17,070
engineering policy with a single label

126
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:19,169
which many people who may have see a lot

127
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,380
of benefits on doing that whether it is

128
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:24,750
the imposition at the source a router

129
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,520
that cannot impose nine or ten labels

130
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:30,380
well what about if he can impose three

131
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,508
can I ask him to impose one sure you can

132
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:37,199
what about in the middle back to ecmp if

133
00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:39,870
i need to ecmp and I have MPLS multiple

134
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,419
MPLS next hops which one do I choose I

135
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:45,270
want to go down into the packet can you

136
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:49,130
ecmp when when you get one label from

137
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,130
this source yes you can

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,039
so how it works we begin from the

139
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:03,090
foundation the first foundation concept

140
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:07,080
is membership a node in your IDP will be

141
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,549
declare a member of a flex algo we call

142
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,609
them by letters you will see them in

143
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:14,970
reality they're really instance numbers

144
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,159
but we call a flex algo que routers in

145
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:19,979
this picture you see how many ten of

146
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,020
them all the routers are part of the

147
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:26,729
algorithm zero which includes all ten

148
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:29,698
routers six of them on the top will be

149
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,440
green routers router 0 router nine and

150
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:34,709
the green routers are the flex I'll go

151
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:41,159
for algo 128 and the bottom routers are

152
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:43,978
my red routers my algorithm 129 as you

153
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:48,510
can see a node can belong to one or

154
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:51,660
multiple flex I chose a flex I'll go can

155
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:58,310
have being able on all the nodes or a

156
00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:01,240
subset of the nodes the next concept is

157
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,699
what does the router advertised

158
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,970
when a router belongs in a flex I'll go

159
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:08,889
he will advertise a flex I'll go seed

160
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:11,139
otherwise please no point for him to

161
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:13,110
being on that flex a legal so in this

162
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:17,470
picture if you look at RADA number nine

163
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:22,629
he will advertise a label for all the

164
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,980
Flex angles that he belongs to and you

165
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:26,410
see the label values on the screen

166
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:30,309
sixteen thousand nine as an example

167
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:34,300
sixteen 809 sixteen nine oh nine for the

168
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:36,969
different Flex algos node number two on

169
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:39,878
the other hand he belongs to only one

170
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:45,029
flex I'll go and the I'll go zero so he

171
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:46,149
advertises two labels and when I said

172
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:51,249
labels

173
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:54,550
I mean labels associated to what to a

174
00:09:51,249 --> 00:09:58,420
single prefix so if you look rod a nine

175
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:02,649
has one loopback one dot one dot one dot

176
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:05,529
nine and multiple labels advertised for

177
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:08,170
that loopback the same label numbers I

178
00:10:05,529 --> 00:10:10,089
told you in the previous slide so you

179
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,089
should be able to come in say one

180
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:15,790
loopback multiple labels now each label

181
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:19,769
has a completely different meaning to

182
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:22,929
get to nine I want to get to nine

183
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:26,049
considering the entire topology or get

184
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:31,170
to nine according to my Flex alga 128 or

185
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:31,170
get to nine according to Flex alga 129

186
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:41,290
so let's summarize the operation four

187
00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:44,259
main steps I mentioned the first one

188
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:47,139
already membership I belong if you look

189
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:50,170
at the upper right hand side I borrow

190
00:10:47,139 --> 00:10:53,499
that apology from before I have a node N

191
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:57,939
and he's exposed to a topper leader has

192
00:10:53,499 --> 00:11:05,079
flex al goes KMP well n is told to be

193
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:06,849
told of flex algo que every router in a

194
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,029
flex algo needs to know the definition

195
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,910
of the Flex algo and that definition has

196
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:14,189
to be consistent and one of the main

197
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,769
things that

198
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,040
we'll see later in the ietf is to have a

199
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:22,129
very solid mechanism to achieve

200
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,980
consistent definition of the Flex algos

201
00:11:22,129 --> 00:11:28,860
how do I know the definition you decide

202
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,439
the definition of the Flex I'll go

203
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:33,810
that's why it's called flex then the

204
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:36,509
definition has to be told to the members

205
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,250
of the Flex I'll go you can include the

206
00:11:36,509 --> 00:11:40,680
definition as part of your day zero

207
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:43,379
automation when you configure no then

208
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,660
you tell him the definition or the

209
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,379
definition can also be learned through

210
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,990
floating in the IGP

211
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:56,939
so I'm a member I know what is the

212
00:11:51,990 --> 00:12:00,569
definition of the Flex I'll go the next

213
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:02,910
step is I need to compute paths in the

214
00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:05,339
Flex I'll go now if you look at the

215
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:08,430
pictures in the upper right hand side

216
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:11,009
you see three pictures the picture of

217
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,920
the entire graph of nodes in the

218
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:16,829
topology the next picture only includes

219
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,579
the rudder in the Flex alga 1:28 graph

220
00:12:16,829 --> 00:12:23,180
and the last graph is the Flex I'll go

221
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:27,120
1:29 or flex I'll go P as I call it

222
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:30,120
so what n will do is he will run

223
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,889
multiple Dijkstra's one for flex I'll

224
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,529
goes for alga zero which includes

225
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:38,100
everybody and then he says wait a moment

226
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:40,620
I'm a member of flex I'll go Kay Kay

227
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,589
happens to be the red topology you see

228
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,680
third in the picture he will remove any

229
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,449
node that is not in Flex I'll go k he

230
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,569
will prune any node that is being

231
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:54,089
excluded from flex I'll go K and the

232
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:57,240
result is what we call the topology of K

233
00:12:54,089 --> 00:13:00,630
and this is the topology that I used to

234
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:04,949
compute my Dijkstra for any destinations

235
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:09,899
that are in the topology of K according

236
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:13,559
to the metric of K and you decide what's

237
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:18,509
going to be the metric of K IG p te or

238
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:22,290
delay so now it's time to move from

239
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:24,630
control to data plane so now I have the

240
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:27,900
different routers who advertise the flex

241
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:31,320
I'll go prefix seats in K now

242
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:35,069
to program the rich ability so n will

243
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,700
install a label cross connecting fib to

244
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:40,710
reach the destinations in topology k

245
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:46,760
those destinations will be along the

246
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:46,760
shortest path to them computed by a GP

247
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,939
at the very beginning I mentioned that

248
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:59,280
this solution is completely ingrained

249
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,310
with the srt toolkit and the SR

250
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:06,740
architecture and the most important

251
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:11,010
piece to highlight now is LFA and TI LFA

252
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:15,870
the TI LFA algorithm is executed per

253
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:18,540
flex algo topology so if I ask for a

254
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:22,530
flex I'll go to compute a primary path

255
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:27,660
to minimize on delay the backup path

256
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:31,140
will minimize on delay even more the

257
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:34,650
backup path will stay among the members

258
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:38,040
of the Flex algo I will never leave my

259
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:41,069
topology flex algo que has a topology

260
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,280
que out of the a topology I have to come

261
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:46,620
up with primary and backups and they're

262
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:52,920
both optimized for the objective that

263
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:55,260
you told me to do so now we arrived at a

264
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:59,010
very important milestone I am able to do

265
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:00,870
traffic engineering with one label to

266
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:04,200
achieve the goals that I put him into

267
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:06,810
the IGP my backup path will obey the

268
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:12,320
same rules and it will stay in the same

269
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:16,770
Flex I'll go topology take us an example

270
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,470
the case of a random topology like the

271
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:23,670
one showing where all the routers belong

272
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:27,540
to the algaas 0 and the algo 128 the

273
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:32,579
algo 128 has a special clause I want to

274
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:35,160
avoid the red link and now what you see

275
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:39,150
in the slide is a primary path to go

276
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:43,310
from 1 to 3 according to Al Gore 0 and

277
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:46,709
algo 128 they are the same

278
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:49,829
no.3 has one loop back and two labels

279
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:54,330
I'll go zero label and I'll go 128 label

280
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:57,900
for his loop back 1 2 1 2 3 so far there

281
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:00,660
is no no mystery here same path for both

282
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,390
legs I'll go the backup paths that TI

283
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,719
LFA will compute are going to be

284
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:10,740
different the backup path that I compute

285
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:13,920
in algo zero if you follow the gray and

286
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:17,910
then the blue arrow will go over the red

287
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:20,760
link so I'll go zero is allowed to use

288
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:23,550
the entire topology and that is what I

289
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,580
did with the backup path of I'll go zero

290
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:30,630
however look at the backup path of algo

291
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:35,370
128 which is gray arrow and then the

292
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:38,939
violet arrow it avoids the red link so

293
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,800
primary path backup path follow the same

294
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:46,530
rules of the topology of your flex I'll

295
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:49,859
go it's very important because as we

296
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:53,699
move into some of the use cases some

297
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:57,030
customers by design by business we're

298
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,970
not allowed to live the confine of their

299
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:03,060
slice no matter what no need not even

300
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:06,510
for 20 30 or 40 microns or milliseconds

301
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:12,149
of backup enforcement always in the

302
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:14,910
slice everything I show until now and

303
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,260
maybe I may have slipped the word is a

304
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,350
yes even though I was trying to be

305
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,500
careful and say always IGP is because

306
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:27,060
this solution is protocol agnostic it

307
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:29,880
applies to is is it applies to OSPF this

308
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:35,389
solution is data plane agnostic it

309
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,390
applies to sr MPLS it applies to sr b6

310
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:46,620
this solution is not a cisco proprietary

311
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:48,840
solution we already have all the drafts

312
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,659
and you will see them here on how the

313
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:54,270
Flex algo solution was already born four

314
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,020
years ago four years ago when you open

315
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,139
the

316
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,300
he textured raft at the ITF there is a

317
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,850
particular area that most likely got

318
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:06,120
omitted by many people reading which is

319
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:09,060
the presence of an algorithm number when

320
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,340
you signal a prefix eed the algorithm

321
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,429
field was already in the books four

322
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:17,659
years ago so there you can refresh your

323
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:21,960
memory and see the algo concept in the

324
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:24,090
advertising of a prefix seed the segment

325
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,950
routing policy draft includes all the

326
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:28,110
behaviors that I'm going to show you in

327
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,420
the use case like on-demand Police

328
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:33,419
instantiation and automate the steering

329
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,820
because nobody makes money just building

330
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,490
an IGP path which is traffic engineer I

331
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,889
have to put services on those paths so

332
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,980
you need to care what's happening on the

333
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:48,240
head end to put my customer traffic into

334
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:51,240
that path but the new draft that for

335
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,160
sure some of you may have noticed is the

336
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:56,970
third draft on the slide that defines

337
00:18:53,160 --> 00:19:00,350
the extensions to ISAs and OSPF to

338
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:07,350
advertise the definition of a flex alga

339
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:10,649
we called it the fad the F ad there is

340
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:13,080
another draft that also well for those

341
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,210
of you who want to optimize multi-domain

342
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,750
networks and you are using a segment rod

343
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:20,670
in PCE how can the PCE learn these flex

344
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:24,180
algo topologies so then you have

345
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:27,420
extensions to bgp LS to propagate the

346
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:31,710
the flex algo topology definition to the

347
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:34,650
controller and then the next to our

348
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:38,630
existing drafts that probably live for

349
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,630
your readings okay

350
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,730
this is the interesting part of my view

351
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,290
because I told you things maybe people

352
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:49,510
who already have problems already

353
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:52,560
realizing how this can be useful to them

354
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,000
I will tell you what is being useful to

355
00:19:52,560 --> 00:20:00,159
many of the Cisco customers that we

356
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,690
interact well the picture that I was

357
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,800
using all throughout this presentation

358
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:08,380
is nothing but the multi-plane design a

359
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,800
multi plane design that is realized so

360
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,780
trivially that there is no tomorrow for

361
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,180
multi plane now you can have your green

362
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,790
plane you can have your red plane you

363
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:22,690
can have notes like 0 & 9 that belongs

364
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:25,899
to both planes you can define how you

365
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:30,190
route in the plane because it's your

366
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:32,140
algo is flex I can do IGP minimization

367
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:35,170
in the green plane I can do delay

368
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:39,610
minimization in the red plane I can make

369
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:45,730
the planes overlap I can do whatever I

370
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:48,459
want from that point of view so what

371
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:52,000
would happen if node number 0 where to

372
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:54,340
send traffic imposing the label that I

373
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,980
show with a gray background which is

374
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:59,139
sixteen thousand nine sixteen thousand

375
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:03,960
nine is a prefect seed of algal zero of

376
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:06,490
the loop pack of nine I think by now

377
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,800
many of you may realize what's going to

378
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,560
happen to that traffic I'm going to load

379
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,310
violence across both planes and I'm

380
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:18,250
going to load balance within each plane

381
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:21,340
so multi plane is CMP and intra plane a

382
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:24,010
CMP this is what happens today so

383
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:27,250
nothing new this is my algo zero

384
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,900
everything okay remember actually I

385
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,600
didn't say this in all of these until

386
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:34,360
now this is only one IGP process there

387
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,209
is no multiple IG piece is one loop back

388
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:42,129
one IDP process in this whole discussion

389
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:44,170
here back to simplicity okay what would

390
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:46,810
happen if node number zero wanted to

391
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:48,780
send traffic to node nine and he was to

392
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:51,850
push the green label the label

393
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:54,850
16800 and nine which is representation

394
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:59,919
of the loop pack of nine in flex al

395
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:03,250
1:28 I no longer will do ecmp

396
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,770
on to the plains I only go to the green

397
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:11,140
plane and then I do ecmp

398
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:15,160
in the green plane again one label allow

399
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:20,020
my entire network to realize this multi

400
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:22,960
plane behavior the next one is obvious

401
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,810
now if you were to push the red label of

402
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:31,030
nine you know what's gonna happen

403
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:34,000
you go down so multi-plane use case is

404
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:37,210
one of the leading use cases of people

405
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,860
who are looking to implement flex I'll

406
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,860
go as quickly as I can

407
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:48,610
the next point is a point of how do we

408
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,590
connect flex I'll go with traffic

409
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,620
engineering at the head end and

410
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:57,070
especially how do I put traffic into the

411
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,229
Flex I'll go for those of you who are

412
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,750
familiar with iOS XR I leave you some

413
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,790
iOS X our CLI but for those of you who

414
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,180
prefer to read English I just want you

415
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:10,590
to read the blue text what I have done

416
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:16,030
here is I have told my hair ends watch

417
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:19,959
four routes with color 100 color 100 the

418
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:24,430
intent that I put on my network I now

419
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:27,460
have a service a BGP service route an e

420
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:30,190
VPN or an IP VPN route that is coming

421
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:33,040
with a color community it's a color

422
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:36,880
community with a value of 100 I know

423
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:42,760
that if I receive 100 I want to reach

424
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:46,570
the BGP next-hop of that route using the

425
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:54,010
Flex I'll go 128 prefix Eid of my BGP

426
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:57,210
next hop and I'm done let's look at an

427
00:23:54,010 --> 00:24:00,160
example the same multi-plane topology

428
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:02,310
the sample configuration I gave you in

429
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:08,320
the previous slide which is basically

430
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:11,440
intent 100 means flex alga 128

431
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,669
now rodder number nine is advertising a

432
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,580
bpn before prefix evpn drought doesn't

433
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:21,670
matter I have a color on that route with

434
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,710
a color 100 you see that in green the

435
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:28,780
route is coming with a BGP next hop of

436
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:31,720
nine with the template I told you in the

437
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:35,080
previous slide which is configure no

438
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,750
zero with that template I'm going to

439
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:41,169
program directly in fib

440
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:44,680
an entry for that prefix where I'm going

441
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:48,210
to push two labels the first label is

442
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:51,880
the bpn label of my prefix or my BRF

443
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:56,410
which in this case is 80,000 the next

444
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:59,920
label is the prefix seed 128 algo label

445
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:06,910
of my BGP next hop for that prefix which

446
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:09,280
is 16,000 809 directly sort of so Phoebe

447
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:13,420
is directly programmed to put the

448
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:15,850
traffic into the flexible path there is

449
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,610
no other feature you are doing onto the

450
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:21,010
ingress router all you did at service

451
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:25,000
provisioning is provision the service

452
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:29,050
with the intent and the intent was this

453
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:31,810
color 100 now when I receive traffic for

454
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,450
that destination the traffic will

455
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:39,090
automatically go only onto the green

456
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:44,890
plane we call this behavior on the Heron

457
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:47,260
automated steering but what would have

458
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:50,860
happened if the prefix that came from

459
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:54,160
nine came with no color it didn't come

460
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:57,040
with a color 100 at least I'm not

461
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,520
showing you any color there so in that

462
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:03,610
case I will program directly to my

463
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,430
algorithm zero label of my BGP next hop

464
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:08,770
which is sixteen thousand nine followed

465
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:11,800
by the VPN label seventy thousand in

466
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:15,430
this case so now my traffic will go

467
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,649
across any plane all of this intent and

468
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:21,710
this coloring we're showing it to you

469
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:23,630
here at a a per prefix level so

470
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:26,210
you could have all the prefixes in a

471
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:30,169
service have the same intent or you can

472
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,880
change the color per intent something

473
00:26:30,169 --> 00:26:35,210
we're not showing you we don't have time

474
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:40,370
for that you can also place intent per

475
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:46,399
flow as well it's a very powerful

476
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:51,799
concept the second use case has to do

477
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:53,629
with delay optimize routing I have a

478
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,690
topology I show you in the upper right

479
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:59,690
hand side in that apology there are some

480
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:02,779
green numbers next to every link those

481
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:06,529
numbers are not static metrics those

482
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:12,130
numbers are the measure link delay on

483
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:15,620
those interfaces so 23 is 23

484
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:18,830
microseconds 20 16 micro seconds and so

485
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,600
on I have the ability to do two things

486
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,720
before I go into what I'm going to tell

487
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:28,010
you first I have to measure the delay of

488
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:32,120
my link second I have to flood that

489
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:35,419
delay value in is is or OSPF and then

490
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:40,549
third I give it to a GP to compute a

491
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:43,520
path to minimize the delay and I do have

492
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:46,750
for that purpose I have one algo 1:28

493
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:49,299
where I'm going to minimize on delay

494
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:54,130
across all the routers in the topology

495
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:57,260
everybody's a member so the obvious view

496
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:59,360
assuming IDP metrics are the same what

497
00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:02,809
you see in blue in the lower left is the

498
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:07,699
paths to go from 0 to 9 following a GP

499
00:28:02,809 --> 00:28:11,330
metric nothing new there for that I push

500
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:15,770
the label 16,000 9 which is the algaas 0

501
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:18,080
label of my destination what is new is

502
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:20,059
what's happening next what you see in

503
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,809
the lower right hand side in the green

504
00:28:20,059 --> 00:28:27,590
arrow is the delay minimized path from 0

505
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:30,399
to 9 and that path only follows the path

506
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:34,370
that is shown on the green arrow that

507
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,209
path was computed by the IGP that path

508
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:39,080
only

509
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:41,179
it's to push one label by the hem that

510
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,039
label is sixteen thousand eight or nine

511
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:52,100
which is my prefix heed of I'll go 128

512
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:54,820
for my destination the next use case

513
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,399
which I'm very excited because

514
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,379
everything you hear these days about

515
00:28:57,399 --> 00:29:03,889
encryption security encryption security

516
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:06,159
encryption and security in this case we

517
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:08,630
call it the intelligent secure path I

518
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,299
now have a topology that has grown

519
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:16,640
naturally over time and it includes a

520
00:29:11,299 --> 00:29:19,270
mix of encrypted interfaces Mac sack

521
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,890
encrypted hub link by link and

522
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,200
interfaces that are not encrypted maybe

523
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,570
some of my line cards can not do

524
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,669
encryption so I only have Mac sakie in

525
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,129
the newer line cards maybe some of my

526
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:34,340
notes are too old or even support Mac

527
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:35,840
sack the newer no support Mac sack so

528
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,928
what you see on the upper right hand

529
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,049
side is a organically grown topology

530
00:29:38,929 --> 00:29:45,620
that includes Mac second able and open

531
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:47,899
unencrypted links the Mac sect links are

532
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:51,918
in green the links with our encryption

533
00:29:47,899 --> 00:29:55,668
are in brown I can go in and in a very

534
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:58,880
trivial fashion I can tell i is is or

535
00:29:55,669 --> 00:30:02,360
OSPF in this topology to install a flex

536
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,659
algo instance that avoids unencrypted

537
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:10,000
links or I could tell him the opposite

538
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:14,029
that includes only encrypted links and

539
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,610
then again the same starting point is

540
00:30:14,029 --> 00:30:19,789
CMP no restrictions you see the blue

541
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:22,668
arrows with a flex I'll go instance now

542
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:25,730
defining the way I told you I am going

543
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:30,409
to have my path that goes over the green

544
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:32,059
arrow only using Mac SEC links and I

545
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:35,419
think the next common I'm gonna make is

546
00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:38,000
perhaps the most important the il FA is

547
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:40,309
enabled in this topology so you are

548
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,340
guaranteed if you have an off topology

549
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:45,350
to have a backup path the backup path

550
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,419
will be installed less than 50

551
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:50,730
milliseconds IDP will converge your

552
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:55,290
back up path will only use encrypted

553
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:57,630
links you will never leave encryption so

554
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:59,700
you are always encrypted even for the

555
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:03,390
smallest amount of time even during

556
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:07,530
backups that's why this is such an

557
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:09,900
interesting use case these are another

558
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:13,430
one that is very very pragmatic it has

559
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:15,870
to do with high bandwidth preference I

560
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:18,390
think many of you may relate to

561
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:21,270
topologies like this where the bandwidth

562
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,730
on your interface your interface speeds

563
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,470
is all over the place you have super

564
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,850
high speed high speed and low speed

565
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:32,310
interfaces the goal not to repeat myself

566
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:35,699
too much is to go through the to the

567
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:38,040
topology through for example my high

568
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:40,440
speed interfaces only I want to go

569
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:42,899
through hundred gigs or above when I'm

570
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,790
ready for 400 gig as an example and

571
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:48,660
those are the interfaces that I want to

572
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:52,020
traverse so very trivially now with Flex

573
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:56,640
I'll go I can actually tell a flex alga

574
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:59,910
instance to avoid low speed or include

575
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,840
high speed how do I achieve that those

576
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:07,110
semantics I do that by using link admin

577
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:11,280
groups link colors so I tell Flex I'll

578
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:15,620
go to include hi or exclude low and you

579
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:18,090
color the links same starting point and

580
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,959
with a flex I'll go that does what I

581
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,939
told you about

582
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,600
here's your path that only uses a

583
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,600
hundred gig or more speed interfaces

584
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:37,930
if we had more time we will come back to

585
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,000
what is a very top of mind to Cisco and

586
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,559
I hope to customers is well how do I

587
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,580
make use of flex I'll go for multi

588
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:45,700
domain topologies

589
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:48,309
I want my SRP ce2 computer multi domain

590
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:52,930
path that leverages the Flex I'll go as

591
00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:55,110
I Traverse from domain to domain we'll

592
00:32:52,930 --> 00:33:02,110
do that next time

593
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:04,990
in conclusion flex algo is the newest

594
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:09,909
member of the SRT toolkit and you should

595
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:13,870
see it as your way to customizing prefix

596
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:17,850
segments to your needs you will realize

597
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:21,070
a te path computed by the IGP and

598
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:27,610
enforced with a single label which are

599
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:29,649
significant benefits and lastly you

600
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,870
cannot look at flex algo in isolation

601
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:34,300
you have to look at your vendors and

602
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:38,229
look at the Flex algo in conjunction

603
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:41,559
with how can i generate on the man based

604
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:45,250
on intent a flex a policy that uses flex

605
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:48,220
algo how can I automatically put traffic

606
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:51,280
into a flex I'll go into a policy that

607
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:54,460
uses flex I'll go per if exceeds they

608
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:58,360
all have to go together okay this is no

609
00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:00,340
Frankenstein if you want to stay in

610
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:03,639
touch there are many links in here that

611
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,740
you may be familiar with beginning from

612
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:09,429
the Sacramento area net website which I

613
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:13,929
highly recommend in the bottom there are

614
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:16,149
some news to share two and a half years

615
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:19,590
ago we released the very first and the

616
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:22,899
only textbook on SR we call it part one

617
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:25,899
part two is now available in pre-order

618
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:31,210
if you go to Amazon part two is focus on

619
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:32,739
traffic engineering and with that I want

620
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,940
to thank you for for your time if there

621
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,699
are any questions please come to the

622
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:39,870
mics or be glad to take it one or two

623
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:42,009
questions I think I'm over time already

624
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:44,969
but it doesn't matter because I'm almost

625
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:44,970
the last speaker right

626
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:50,530
thank you

627
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,230
you
