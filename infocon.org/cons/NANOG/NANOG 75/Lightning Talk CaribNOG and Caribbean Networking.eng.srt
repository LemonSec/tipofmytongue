[Music]

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,820
okay

3
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:20,770
[Music]

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:23,290
last presentation all right all right my

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,259
name is Steven Lee from company in

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:28,090
Florida called architects and I'm the

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,169
program manager for Carib knob the

8
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:34,230
Caribbean network operators group which

9
00:00:32,168 --> 00:00:38,349
you all would know what that is about

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:41,169
since we are here can can I see my show

11
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:44,610
of hands anyone who's been to the

12
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:48,909
Caribbean recently or is working with a

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:51,280
few okay so but part of my goal here is

14
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:55,659
to give give everyone reasons to come to

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:59,170
the Caribbean really soon you know so

16
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:02,640
let me talk a little bit about about

17
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:05,500
carb nog it's it's a not-for-profit

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,220
organization community that's dedicated

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,860
to to to basically building technical

20
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:20,050
capacity in the in the Caribbean region

21
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:24,280
much like Na Nog is doing right we care

22
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:28,030
nog serves 17 in the Caribbean region

23
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:31,150
most of them are Island States but also

24
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,400
we have a few in Central and South

25
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,070
Central and South American continent

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,160
mostly english-speaking so that's about

27
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,539
a market of well so the members of

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,929
carbon are mostly in english-speaking

29
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:49,750
where carbonyls concern is as a whole is

30
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:51,700
a region as a whole and so we the the

31
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,150
region is served by both Aaron and

32
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:58,840
latnok so we have a nice collaboration

33
00:01:55,150 --> 00:02:02,230
going on there inside of the region not

34
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,640
everyone would be aligned to Carib nog a

35
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:07,060
country like porto rico

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,800
would be more aligned to nanog the dom

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,500
rep and someone Spanish speak income

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,670
countries would would be aligned to lat

39
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,980
nog and that's that's where the the the

40
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:24,730
primary resource comes from Cavanaugh

41
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:27,310
was started in in 2007 actually out some

42
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,100
some initiatives of the Catholic

43
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,450
Telecommunications Union

44
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:39,150
and and packet Clearinghouse actually

45
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:41,310
one of the the initiations for it was my

46
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:46,470
first nanog meeting I think it was

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:50,340
October 2007 Nanak 41 in Albuquerque and

48
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:53,250
I was at that meeting within who some of

49
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:56,070
you would know also carbonyl co-founder

50
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:00,390
we sat in that meeting and we were

51
00:02:56,070 --> 00:03:05,090
hearing about router leaks and BGP flap

52
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:08,279
and spawn like you know of the geeking

53
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,680
and one of the things I realize is that

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,930
this we have operators in the Caribbean

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,020
but this kind of discourse isn't taking

56
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,750
place in the region and so we started to

57
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:21,180
work together with the CTU with packing

58
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,270
Clearing House started a long track from

59
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:26,910
2007 and in 2010 who actually had our

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,820
first meeting since then we've had 17

61
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,430
regional meetings cabinet needs twice a

62
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:35,640
year and on average we have around 50

63
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:38,430
persons 50 to 100 persons would be in a

64
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:42,299
meeting and we'll be covering a lot the

65
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:45,210
topics you see here routing v6 cloud

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:49,290
computing and hosting internet exchange

67
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:51,060
points which are a huge part of the

68
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,400
infrastructure development that we that

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:57,380
we were concerned about networking and

70
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,180
resilience the meetings move between

71
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,490
Caribbean countries and so we would have

72
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,980
a meeting in the spring meeting in the

73
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,610
fall and we move between different

74
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,799
countries which you see here a real

75
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,290
concern and an accord thing that we're

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:17,420
interested in is its networking or

77
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:22,048
people or operators or IT providers

78
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:26,750
students regulators government or Carib

79
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:26,750
dog meetings are really vibrant

80
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,760
get-togethers of of persons who are

81
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:36,780
interested in in this subject matter

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:39,090
we have ICT forums and committees and so

83
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,299
on but the kind of flavor that you have

84
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:45,570
in a nanometer an iron mitten in which

85
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:48,389
you can have a community-wide discussion

86
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:51,719
and discourse on person and topics that

87
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:55,650
been quite exist and and carbon art has

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,080
given a form for that with support of of

89
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,960
the organization's work very closely as

90
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,310
I mentioned with with armed with latnok

91
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,830
with the Internet Society with ICANN and

92
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:11,810
with packet Clearing House and since

93
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,520
2007 we've basically been building on

94
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,330
strengthening the infrastructure in the

95
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:21,299
region so what do we have in the region

96
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,210
we have high high end lots of fiber

97
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,710
connectivity there's lots of fiber

98
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,080
connecting the island and have a few

99
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,229
major data centers especially in the

100
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,260
major population errors Jamaica and

101
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:36,690
Trinidad and so you know broadband

102
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,940
penetration mobile penetration those

103
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:42,450
were those would be things that that our

104
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:44,789
operators and IT persons are working

105
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:48,060
towards so we have that and then at the

106
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:51,150
other end we have satellite you know in

107
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,729
remote areas and this would be a picture

108
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:56,580
of the grenade and internet exchange

109
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:59,370
point gets in spun up right just a few

110
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,280
devices in Iraq at the starting point a

111
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,940
few of you might actually know recognize

112
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,349
Johnny Martin instead of that photo

113
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:10,889
Johnny it's spent a lot of time with us

114
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,990
helping to get a lot of this stuff off

115
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:19,010
the ground and so we have the full range

116
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:22,289
of concerns inside of the community and

117
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:26,190
and what we're working towards so just

118
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:28,020
to give a sense of of what we have on

119
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:33,270
the schedule for this year and this is

120
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:35,520
my pitch for come to the Caribbean we in

121
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:38,700
addition to the carob knob main meetings

122
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,950
themselves we have a number of smaller

123
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:44,639
meetings and interventions targeted at

124
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:48,440
specific topics one that you might be

125
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,840
particularly interested in is the

126
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:55,530
catalog 17 meetin in Barbie

127
00:06:51,840 --> 00:07:00,179
in April it's on the 10th of April right

128
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:02,159
after the iron mitten so if you come for

129
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,060
iron you could steal a four-carat knob

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,630
if you're so if you're so inclined and

131
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:13,530
also we have rotated workshop resilience

132
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:15,479
workshop planned in in Dominica carpet

133
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,960
for Caribbean peering an interconnection

134
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:22,830
forum in in Grenada this year is an

135
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,229
annual meetin supported by bicarbonate

136
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,409
and is basically the peering forum in

137
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:31,349
which we get or operators and content

138
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:35,639
providers connected up this would be the

139
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:40,550
fourth year fourth year of existence and

140
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:43,620
it's really caused a leap forward in the

141
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,620
performance of the networks options

142
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,410
available as caches have have come into

143
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:53,220
the region to share in forums like this

144
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:56,400
and then targeting our schools and our

145
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:00,030
students we have a next-gen bootcamp

146
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,760
coming up in in August and an emergent

147
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:05,820
networks workshop for for community

148
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:09,659
network operators and those really small

149
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,960
ISPs who want to get get off the off the

150
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:17,190
ground so that's that's just to give you

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,669
a snapshot of what of what we we have

152
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:23,820
going on in carob knob and I really do

153
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:27,150
encourage encourage you we have a lot of

154
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,669
support already from members of of Nano

155
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:32,520
their number of persons inside of this

156
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:34,848
community who who not just come out to

157
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,490
meetings but actually lend assistance

158
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:41,700
through in the 2017 hurricane season a

159
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:45,050
lot of Na Nog members actually helped in

160
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:47,190
the in the background in terms of the

161
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:50,790
resilience discussions and the

162
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,220
rebuilding work that was going on so

163
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:56,490
we're looking right now to even

164
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:00,240
strengthen our relationship with Nana

165
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:03,750
as as Karen objets goes into the next

166
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,640
phase of of its journey so hope to see
