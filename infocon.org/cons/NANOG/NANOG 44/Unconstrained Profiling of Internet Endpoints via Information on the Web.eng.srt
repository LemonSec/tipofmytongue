3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:13,980
here for much long so this talk is about

4
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:17,100
how we can use google for doing

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,670
networking research and the title of the

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,230
talk is unconstrained profiling of

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet endpoints that is IP addresses</font>

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,529
via publicly available information as in

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,320
on the web this is joint work done with

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">said is it possible to to use google for</font>

18
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,839
doing networking research that is can we

19
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,699
if you wanted to find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

20
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,860
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about an IP address could we</font>

21
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,530
just send a google query for it and

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,039
could we learn something about it as it

23
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,540
turns out you know you you whenever you

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,640
get a chance try it out you will find

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,130
tons of information about IP addresses

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
are already available on the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

27
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is can we do this in a</font>

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,630
systematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so that the results</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">we get are they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more structured and</font>

30
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:32,270
that is the question that we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

31
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:32,270
address in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this work oops</font>

32
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:42,520
so and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> applications for</font>

33
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:45,350
this would be for example if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

34
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:48,229
security portal via which you are

35
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,960
monitoring for ddos attacks in in a

36
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,960
Security Operations Center and you see a

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,110
DDoS attack and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the IP addresses</font>

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,270
which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> launching the attack then one</font>

39
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:01,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the first questions which which could</font>

40
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,899
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your mind is how what have these</font>

00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:07,880
IP address has done in the past are

42
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:09,860
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOTS or are these actual human</font>

43
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,750
beings who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably contributing to</font>

44
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the DDoS attack as we've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

45
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:16,820
past they have been quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few DDoS</font>

46
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,400
attacks for instance a one which was

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,810
recently launched again CNN in which it

48
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,600
was actually human beings who were

49
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,700
clicking on CNN refreshing the page

50
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,359
continuously in order to potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

51
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so now as it turns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out about one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959
the first things you would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

53
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:35,060
maybe a do an nslookup for that IP

54
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,100
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you could do a whois query to</font>

55
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,440
find out what else has these this I

56
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">theaters been doing in the past</font>

57
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,769
sometimes you may not get any

58
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:47,000
information out of nslookup or who is

59
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:48,980
and then you turn back to google and you

60
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,890
would find terms of information which

61
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:57,170
comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> with both the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URL and the hit</font>

62
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,690
text surrounding the IP address as found

63
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,790
on the web<font color="#CCCCCC"> pages and now as you would</font>

64
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,459
see there are tens of keywords over here

65
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,429
such as that the most common one is stat

66
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:09,440
and usage now you would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking how</font>

67
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,720
so and this is the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> we try to</font>

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,370
address how can we now make use of the

69
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,170
results that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got out of Google for</font>

70
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,180
better understanding what this IP

71
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,940
address has been doing in the past on

72
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,890
the internet and the other question

73
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:24,230
which the obvious question which<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may</font>

74
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,048
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where does all this information</font>

75
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:30,440
come on a search engine where does it

76
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:32,630
come from so there are multiple ways one

77
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the ways there's a lot of servers for</font>

78
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:39,200
example gaming servers are they their IP

79
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:43,040
addresses are I are listed on very

80
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known websites similarly it turns</font>

81
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,420
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> even you could learn a lot of</font>

82
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,750
information not just about servers but

83
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,019
even

84
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,850
what clients and the way you would the

85
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,310
way this happens is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

86
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,590
websites they run logging software and

87
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,950
sometimes their web logs are posted on

88
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:03,950
the internet and Google crawls it and

89
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,119
you could in fact if if the web block

90
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,700
contains the information you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,470
find out for example what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

92
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,869
operating system that this IP address as

93
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,730
a client was associated with what is the

94
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,010
web browser that the client accessed it

95
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:21,980
with and so on similarly a lot of proxy

96
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:24,800
services they have the Lord's available

97
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,810
on the web and even p2p information is

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,640
available on the internet because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

99
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,100
first point of contact usually with the

100
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,770
PTP swarm is is a publicly<font color="#CCCCCC"> available IP</font>

101
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:36,260
address for example for bittorrent you

102
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,659
you typically go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a torrent portal and</font>

103
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:42,830
find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list of torrent service you</font>

104
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:46,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">could contact and moreover for a lot of</font>

105
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:49,099
a lot of ban lists<font color="#E5E5E5"> black lists and spam</font>

106
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,919
lists they also have web interfaces and

107
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,410
even that information it finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> its way</font>

108
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,190
into all the search engines as they

109
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,960
crawl the web now<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we wanted to do</font>

110
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:03,830
was to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could answer a couple</font>

111
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,960
of networking research questions so one

112
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,469
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first ones we try to answer was</font>

113
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this information available</font>

114
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">on Google to get an idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for what kinds</font>

115
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,860
of applications are people using in

116
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:21,740
which parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world and can we most</font>

117
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,350
importantly can we do this without even

118
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,530
having access to any traces from those

119
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,600
countries the second question<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted</font>

120
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:32,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address was can we use this</font>

121
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:36,800
information for<font color="#E5E5E5"> classifying traffic as</font>

122
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:38,390
in when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see when we see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we do</font>

123
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,910
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to a trace and we see a</font>

124
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,190
packet from one IP address to another IP

125
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,140
address then can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make use of this</font>

126
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,020
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we got from google for</font>

127
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:50,450
better classifying this packet as in

128
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,490
which application it belongs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and</font>

129
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,000
there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of approaches for</font>

130
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,800
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic classification those which</font>

131
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,270
those which are behavior and statistics

132
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,430
based and just look at the layer for

133
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,440
information some which

134
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,060
the deep packet inspection utilities

135
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,990
which go deeper and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layer</font>

136
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">seven headers and payloads however we</font>

137
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,860
wanted to answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question that</font>

138
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're just by using layer for</font>

139
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,760
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the port numbers and</font>

140
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,560
IP addresses in conjunction with a real

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:22,700
information available on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web can you</font>

142
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,300
actually classify traffic so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will</font>

143
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:28,039
first present the methodology for the

144
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,200
methodology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we developed for</font>

145
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:32,030
harnessing information out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google and</font>

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:35,450
presenting it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a more structured</font>

147
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:39,080
format so the first thing we the first

148
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:41,960
the first thing our tool does is you

149
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,020
give it an IP address it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it</font>

150
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:50,210
queries at on google and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

151
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:52,310
returns a list of results with both the

152
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,710
URL and the hit text<font color="#CCCCCC"> where the head text</font>

153
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:58,760
is defined as all the texts surrounding

154
00:06:54,710 --> 00:07:03,590
the IP address as<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun in the in the web</font>

155
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:07,070
page then a one of the first things we

156
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,750
do is we we try to just try to just take

157
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,719
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the URL that was returned by</font>

158
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google and see if from the URL itself we</font>

159
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,470
can make sense for what kind of

160
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:19,280
information does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage contain</font>

161
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,960
about IP addresses it turns out there

162
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,929
are some very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple rules you could use</font>

163
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,150
for example a website like DNS server

164
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:28,670
let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk very evidently it contains</font>

165
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,849
information about lists of DNS servers

166
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:35,420
so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find an IP address</font>

167
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:38,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">for which Google returns a result from</font>

168
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:42,080
DNS server list<font color="#CCCCCC"> dot are very likely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

169
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:46,250
IP address is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS server and we have</font>

170
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:50,630
come up we define a mapping from a list

171
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:56,000
of keywords to a class for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

172
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:59,000
so so I so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if a website</font>

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,550
contains the keyword blacklist spam list

174
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,320
or block list then very likely it

175
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,990
contains information about blacklisted

176
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:09,140
IP addresses similarly if the website

177
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">contains information about it contains</font>

178
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,770
the keyword mail server then very likely

179
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,169
all that matters is mentioned there are

180
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,998
mail servers if it contains

181
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:19,370
the word spam or dictionary attacker

182
00:08:16,999 --> 00:08:21,800
next to or very close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keyword</font>

183
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:26,419
mail server then this website also

184
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:30,379
provides information about spammers now

185
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:32,510
it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that a the very simple rule</font>

186
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:35,930
where you just take a look at the URL to

187
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,760
identify what does this website provide

188
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:40,218
you it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't turn out to be very</font>

189
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,838
useful most of the time and then what

190
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:45,470
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do is take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at the hit</font>

191
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,589
list for example this IP address in

192
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,800
question it returned this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular hit</font>

193
00:08:48,589 --> 00:08:54,699
text which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Chinese what we do then</font>

194
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:57,740
is we use we<font color="#E5E5E5"> override on Google's</font>

195
00:08:54,699 --> 00:08:59,990
translation translator converted into

196
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:05,329
English translate it into English and

197
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:08,300
then we build a cache we we try to see

198
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:11,120
if this particular URL is returned as a

199
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">result for many different IP addresses</font>

200
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:19,430
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if this particular website returns</font>

201
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,800
results for a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of IP addresses</font>

202
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:24,500
greater than a certain threshold then we

203
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,050
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this website contains some</font>

204
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:31,940
pertinent information about about IP

205
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:34,969
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a V also then in in this</font>

206
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:38,839
website<font color="#E5E5E5"> cash we maintain a list of</font>

207
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:43,579
keywords which are commonly<font color="#CCCCCC"> found on</font>

208
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:47,449
this web page so in this instance we see

209
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:49,699
the the keyword QQ server it commonly

210
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:52,910
occurs next to the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address and</font>

211
00:09:49,699 --> 00:09:55,490
therefore we maintain that<font color="#E5E5E5"> association</font>

212
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:58,630
that this website maintains or contains

213
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,560
information about potential QQ servers

214
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,019
so now I've told you about how we

215
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,518
classify websites which contain

216
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:10,699
information about IP addresses now we

217
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:14,329
make use of the way we classified a

218
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:17,449
website to now classify an IP address so

219
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:20,660
in our example before if this particular

220
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:22,069
IP address it it returned the URL which

221
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,339
contain information about Q charge

222
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:27,199
servers we become with a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

223
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:28,820
rule saying that the

224
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,220
IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses very likely a QQ chat</font>

225
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:35,090
server and some additional rules as

226
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,950
shown here are for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if an IP</font>

227
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">address for instance is listed in a</font>

228
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">website which was classified as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

229
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:46,489
list website then this<font color="#CCCCCC"> what IP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses</font>

230
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:48,170
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS server and so on now but one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

231
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,690
the as I mentioned one of the first

232
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:54,709
things we wanted to do was answer the

233
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,510
question as can you predict what kinds

234
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,930
of applications are people using in

235
00:10:56,510 --> 00:11:02,870
which parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world very often</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

236
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,689
come up with with with some ground

237
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:09,770
truths like this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to rely on</font>

238
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">having access to network traces but very</font>

239
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:12,890
often than not you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't actually have</font>

240
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:17,600
access to network traces then how do you

241
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:22,819
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you answer such questions so</font>

242
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:25,100
so so what we did was be we took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

243
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:28,250
couple of traces which we had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

244
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">for from China Brazil we also took a</font>

245
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:36,140
trace a sample<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow trace which we</font>

246
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:39,470
had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from us and we took as as</font>

247
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:41,870
a straw<font color="#CCCCCC"> man we took France for which we</font>

248
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:46,250
didn't use any trace and we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

249
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:49,010
just by googling for IP addresses which

250
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,740
are allocated or assigned to these

251
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:55,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries what kinds of information</font>

252
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,410
would be fine so we picked random a

253
00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:00,050
sample of 200,000 IP addresses from each

254
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:02,839
country and we google them we obtained

255
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:05,810
their the keywords which classified

256
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,830
those IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we came up</font>

257
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:13,900
with a statistical histograms for saying

258
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:17,180
what kind of applications are prevalent

259
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:20,840
so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll skip this slide and one</font>

260
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:24,739
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next so so one of the first</font>

261
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:28,460
results we found out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that msn as a</font>

262
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:33,050
chat software is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular in brazil</font>

263
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:34,760
and we also said<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now see how</font>

264
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:37,130
good is this result because this result

265
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,680
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the left on sorry on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right where</font>

266
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,290
we say you EP you

267
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:46,510
for our unconstrained endpoint profiling

268
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:48,910
method so<font color="#E5E5E5"> our method found out that msn</font>

269
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,279
as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chat client is more popular</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

270
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,160
yahoo and any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> chart clients in</font>

271
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">Brazil we wanted to evaluate how good is</font>

272
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,339
our result because this result on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

273
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">right hand side was obtained without</font>

274
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:02,320
using any traces so then we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

275
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:04,959
let's take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the packet trace we</font>

276
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,709
have access to and the packet trace also

277
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,349
gave us a similar result that msn is the

278
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:14,140
most popular chat client of course in

279
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:15,940
terms of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> second and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> third and</font>

280
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">even in the in terms of the order of</font>

281
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:20,380
popularity the results are somewhat

282
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">different and there is a reason for it</font>

283
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">because a packet trace it gives you an</font>

284
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:28,330
information which is temporarily

285
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:30,610
constrained whereas our method using

286
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:33,490
unconstrained endpoint profiling it is

287
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,529
taking a look at what kinds of results

288
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:39,940
do you get for IP addresses so it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

289
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:42,880
better spatial coverage however it does

290
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:44,800
it it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that similar temporal</font>

291
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,589
constraints that the packet trace has

292
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,680

308
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:39,670
even classify traffic so the wavy the

309
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:44,459
event<font color="#CCCCCC"> about doing this is we picked the</font>

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,570
keywords are the tags which classify

316
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,840

317
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:05,710
in a cache and now we replayed that

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:08,470
trace and whenever we see either the

319
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:13,180

321
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:19,300
we classify that flow accordingly and

322
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,540
the classification rule we use is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

323
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,219
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple it is if you see a packet</font>

324
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to a mail server it is very likely</font>

325
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,550
a male flow if you see a packet going to

326
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:34,690
your website say<font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube then it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very</font>

327
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">likely streaming media and so on so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

328
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">course you would have questions as to</font>

329
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">how could how well would such a naive</font>

330
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:44,740
and simple classification will perform

331
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,140
and and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> question you would</font>

332
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,020
have is is this approach scalable at all

333
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:53,260
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer the second question</font>

334
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:58,240
first which is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this approach is</font>

335
00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:01,120
scalable because as it turns out there

336
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,170
are more that there are elephants

337
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:09,520
present in traffic there are top with

338
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:11,140
the top 5% the five percent of IP

339
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,870
addresses they contribute to ninety-five

340
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,720
percent of traffic in any network and we

341
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:18,790
took a look at the three<font color="#CCCCCC"> network traces</font>

342
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,950
that we had access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and it turned out</font>

343
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:24,400
that this this rule was true so

344
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:27,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">therefore we realize that we don't need</font>

345
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go out and Google for all the IP</font>

346
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,520
addresses from the trees we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

347
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:34,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">google for the top</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five percent of the</font>

348
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,740
IP addresses then to answer the first

349
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,870
question that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how well does this</font>

350
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:40,570
traffic classification perform we

351
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:43,540
compared it against a method which was

352
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:47,380
presented at nano 35 called blink which

353
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:50,410
is a method which words in the dark that

354
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">is this approach it doesn't take a look</font>

355
00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:55,930
at the payload it only takes a look at

356
00:16:54,040 --> 00:17:00,130
the layer four characteristics of the

357
00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:01,900
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it takes a look at it uses a</font>

358
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,279
graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's kind of approach where it</font>

359
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,709
tries to see

360
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,689
the patterns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tries to identify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

361
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:12,669
patterns<font color="#E5E5E5"> of who is contacting whom at</font>

362
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:15,100
which port numbers and we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

363
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:17,669
let's let's compare with this method and

364
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:20,079
our approach as I just described is is

365
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:21,789
based on using information which is

366
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,089
available freely available on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the web</font>

367
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:31,658
and by constructing a database of

368
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:33,399
endpoints so so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we did</font>

369
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:35,409
this we ran this experiment<font color="#CCCCCC"> on all the</font>

370
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">faces we had access to I will present</font>

371
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:43,030
results here from<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one of the traces</font>

372
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:45,100
so as you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> total amount of</font>

373
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:48,850
traffic which was classified by our

374
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:53,370
approach is almost twice<font color="#CCCCCC"> as much as was</font>

375
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:56,860
classified by blink and if you did a

376
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:59,530
category by category comparison blink

377
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,289
did not even find a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> categories like</font>

378
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:05,830
streaming mail FTP and so on and the

379
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:08,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason being that that blink is is a</font>

380
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:12,070
method which relies on having a certain

381
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:14,770
threshold that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you see more than a</font>

382
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:16,809
certain number of IP addresses sending

383
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,970
traffic on a particular port to a

384
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:21,330
particular server then you potentially

385
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:26,710
classify it as of a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> type and</font>

386
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:28,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of times you know that those</font>

387
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:33,130
thresholds would have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be dynamically</font>

388
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,809
adjust it and they may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> work as good</font>

389
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,610
it may work on one phrase but may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

390
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,740
work equally good with the similar

391
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,699
thresholds in a different network with

392
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,899
the different traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> editor</font>

393
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:45,909
characteristics it turns out that our

00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:47,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">methodology using google the internet it</font>

395
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:52,270
also provides better semantics<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

396
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:56,169
example for example not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only can we</font>

397
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:58,000
detect p2p not only can be detected for

398
00:18:56,169 --> 00:19:03,370
example a chart traffic we could even go

399
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead and classify it as an msn flow or</font>

400
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">a yahoo flow and all of this without</font>

401
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:10,389
even taking a look at the payloads and

402
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:13,600
without even taking a look at the port

403
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,630
numbers now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other question you might</font>

404
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,300
have is

405
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,700
how good does this method perform

406
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,000
against a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 signature-based</font>

407
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,530
traffic classification now there are

408
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,170
lots of deep packet inspection

409
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:31,790
technologies which which take a look at

410
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:33,980
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> which take a look at strings or</font>

411
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,950
regular expressions in the layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7</font>

412
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:39,950
packet payloads and headers to identify

413
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:43,970
and classify traffic we compared against

414
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:46,250
a against one such solution which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Norris</font>

develops and the signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> based</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that a unconstrained endpoint profiling</font>

419
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,940
it performs as well almost as well as

420
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:03,560
signature based classification you EP

421
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,180
was able to classify sixty percent of

traffic compared to the signature based

423
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,620
methodology which classified seventy

424

it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> very it works equally well or</font>

00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:26,600
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact even better in cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where there</font>

because<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Spees they only</font>

431
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,260
considered to be scalable to provide

432
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:41,020
sampled a flow information for traffic

433
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:43,280
classification purposes and a typical

434
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:48,020
typically packet sampling is deployed

435
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,000
where you would randomly pick one packet

436
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,870
out of every let's say 100 packets for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

437
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,940
one is 200 sampling ratio and it turns

438
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:58,340
out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the first questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

439
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,850
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask was when you're working</font>

440
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:04,639
with sample traffic then what kinds of

441
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,709
IP addresses are still left in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

442
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,810
traffic so we took the trace as we had

443
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">access to the packet traces we</font>

444
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:15,379
implemented an emulated<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco net flow</font>

445
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,629
of packet sampling varied the sampling

446
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,460
rates and as you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the x-axis I</font>

447
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:23,290
have the varied sampling rate going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

448
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:26,210
one is 2121 is 200 and we wanted to

449
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer the question as to how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

450
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,530
addresses are present in the trace

451
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,990
as you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did this for two traces</font>

452
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:34,820
we had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you see the total</font>

453
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of IP addresses that is left as</font>

454
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:41,080
you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and go on sampling it reduces</font>

455
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:46,130
from it reduces to twenty percent

456
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:48,710
however and most importantly the top 5%

457
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,880
of IP addresses which contributed to 90

458
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,760
persons ninety-five percent of the

459
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,360
traffic they they still<font color="#E5E5E5"> remain in the</font>

460
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:58,700
trace even after<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sample it all the</font>

461
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:02,830
way up to one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 and that result is</font>

462
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:06,380
important because it tells you that if

463
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:09,110
you can can go out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google for those</font>

464
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,790
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5%</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of IP addresses then even in</font>

465
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:14,330
cases where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> only have sampled</font>

466
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:22,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">netflow available I don't know what</font>

467
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:23,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened here so uh but no man I I will</font>

468
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:26,060
just talk through the rest of this

469
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">because i was almost at the end of the</font>

470
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:31,790
tour so even in cases where where you

471
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,120
only have sample NetFlow data available

472
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:37,730
our unconstrained endpoint profiling

473
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,669
based traffic classification it performs

474
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:41,990
as well I don't I'm afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't be</font>

475
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,040
able to show you the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it but</font>

476
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:52,880
the results can be found in the paper

477
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:55,700
and so to conclude the this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

478
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,830
those this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those wacky ideas</font>

479
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,630
we had that let's see if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

480
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:02,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">google for IP addresses and and see if</font>

481
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,850
we can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> this for answering a couple</font>

482
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,970
of questions that is can we predict or

483
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,230
can we come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some sort of ground</font>

484
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,750
truth about what kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of applications</font>

485
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,570
are used in which parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world and</font>

486
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:17,600
we showed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> results about that and the</font>

487
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:19,820
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> question we we had was can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you use</font>

488
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">this such an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach for even</font>

489
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,200
classifying traffic and I showed you a

490
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:27,050
couple of results about that more

491
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:30,920
details about this can be found at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

492
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:34,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">tour paper and that the talk can be</font>

493
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,960
found online on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog site and and</font>

494
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,580
there is a URL over there which

495
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,560
pinpoints to where the paper can be

496
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,889
downloaded so that brings<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to the end</font>

497
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:48,360
of the talk if you have any

498
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:52,490
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I be happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take them cool no</font>

499
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,490
questions thank you
