14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,800
academics here will probably notice the

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:59,578
trick I'm going to do with the

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:01,949
statistics bear with me so unique IP

17
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,030
addresses basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the state is</font>

18
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,310
based upon what Akamai is seeing people

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,939
are making requests from so we're seeing

20
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,220
requests from about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 46 million</font>

21
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">unique IP addresses on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

22
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,179
you heard dr. Cerf this morning

23
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,720
mentioned other people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> estimating</font>

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,340
there's probably over 500 million IP

25
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:26,970
addresses on the internet so obviously

26
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,380
there we're not seeing everything oh we

27
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,869
estimate there's probably about a

28
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:33,509
billion<font color="#E5E5E5"> users behind those IP addresses</font>

29
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:40,110
are hiding out behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP napped and so</font>

30
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:42,810
forth and for some countries we saw less

31
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,049
than a thousand IP addresses and when

32
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,990
you get down that small it gets hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

33
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:51,240
make any sense out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers for</font>

34
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:54,539
example one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the small countries the</font>

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,548
Vatican a very small country very few

36
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,340
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP addresses happens to have</font>

37
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,520
probably the best IP connectivity in the

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">world as far as country level goes but</font>

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,829
and very high density of IP addresses

40
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,129
per number of citizens in the Vatican

41
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,190
but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't the statistics don't make</font>

42
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,870
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

43
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,240
that kind of level so that's kind of the

44
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,950
trick that the academics are going to

45
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:21,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">get upset about that we've kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

46
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,929
excluded a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data but the</font>

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">data that we've left with we think is</font>

48
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:30,420
somewhat interesting so obviously United

49
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:35,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">States's is still big china's coming up</font>

50
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:38,350
and so forth so then we looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

51
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,750
other interesting thing for us is what

52
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,299
speeds are people actually seeing on the

53
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet we all know the advertising</font>

54
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:51,310
speeds that that get advertised it's

55
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:53,769
like we're selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> EE or whatever but</font>

56
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,260
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the typical of speed that people</font>

57
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,060
are seeing and rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and break</font>

58
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">it tell you what's the speed in each</font>

59
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,050
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because then it gets</font>

60
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:04,390
difficult which provider are you talking

61
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,720
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth we're grouping it by</font>

62
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:10,899
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really broad ranges of speeds so</font>

63
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,330
greater than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 megabits per second South</font>

64
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,700
Korea over<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty four percent of the IP</font>

65
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:20,440
addresses that we see in South Korea got

66
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:24,190
over 5 megabits per second all the way

67
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,260
down to number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Denmark eighteen</font>

68
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:29,890
percent of the users were getting over

69
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">five megabits per second that's even</font>

70
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:35,290
though some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those countries were</font>

71
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,120
advertising a much higher speeds these

72
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,510
are the speeds that that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

73
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,280
in practice and you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that the</font>

74
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:48,190
drop-off happens pretty quick it goes

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:49,750
from 60 is it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> me or the drop-off</font>

76
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:52,030
happens pretty quick from<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixty four</font>

77
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,610
percent down to thirty two percent for

78
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:58,390
Sweden down to eighteen percent for

79
00:03:54,610 --> 00:04:00,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Denmark on the other end of the scale we</font>

80
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:02,380
have the what we see is the slowest

81
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,820
countries again we eliminated 38

82
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,480
countries because we just didn't have

83
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:09,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough data and some of those countries</font>

84
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">were probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beyond the slow end but</font>

85
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,320
like I said you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the 38</font>

86
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,640
countries would be on the high end also

87
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:18,399
most of the countries that we see with

88
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:23,820
slow speeds tend to be islands on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

96
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,410
you you would not be surprised that

97
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:48,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rwanda we see is when the slowest</font>

100
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:01,780
for interest the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States is 96</font>

101
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:08,650
with about 8.2 percent of the

connections at less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 256 k but we're</font>

in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business of making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money so it's</font>

like the max<font color="#E5E5E5"> and min is interesting but</font>

105
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,639
really what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it that the sweet spot</font>

106
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to aim at for getting data</font>

107
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,590
to customers and right now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like</font>

108
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sweet spot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now globally is</font>

109
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,900
about 2 megabits per second about sixty

110
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:31,180
percent of the global IP connections

111
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:33,010
that we're seeing are greater than 2

112
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,960
megabits per second and obviously the

113
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:39,640
rest of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson 2 2 megabits per</font>

114
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,620

115
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,110
graph to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the earlier graph of the five</font>

116
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,930
megabits per second you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that</font>

117
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,630
again South Korea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is number one with</font>

118
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,510
over ninety percent being over 2

119
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,000
megabits per second and the United

120
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,870
States drops out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the top 10 to number</font>

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,370
20 with just over seventy percent

122
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:02,800
achieving over 2 megabits per second

123
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:06,669
again these are actual speeds not

124
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,830
advertising speeds so on the TV they're

125
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:10,870
advertising you get 20 megabits per

126
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,380
second or whatever but we're seeing

127
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:21,070
about 27 t %<font color="#E5E5E5"> or getting greater than 2</font>

128
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:24,370
megabits per second and finally we have

00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:26,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">the link for the the full report has a</font>

whole bunch more<font color="#E5E5E5"> statistics and and</font>

131
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:32,409
things that will get the academics mad

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting data</font>

about making scenes between these

alkaline would be comfortable sharing

publicly to show us something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and</font>

on the Akamai website we do have

something that's put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on by our marketing</font>

department so it's slightly<font color="#E5E5E5"> fluffy but</font>

if Patrick or Christian has any more

00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,880
out willy-nilly and we might have to

171
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,929
sign an NDA but we give we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

well<font color="#CCCCCC"> deep rose and she says she did you</font>

for these

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:39,640
things did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into account the</font>

177
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:41,740

178
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,909
seriousness<font color="#CCCCCC"> Akamai servers are not</font>

179
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:46,000
allowed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over sixty percent so</font>

180
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,069
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem so I put it on my</font>

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,140
slide and skipped over it basically we

182
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,910
don't throw the individual TCP sessions

183
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:54,160
but we do control<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

184
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:56,589
connections to a server so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server's</font>

185
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,630
don't get overloaded so we spread<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

186
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,060
load out among server so no individual

187
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:03,550
server will get overloaded so generally

188
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:08,489
the bottleneck always be at the end user

189
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,490
side and on the server side is also

190
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:15,010
correct because if we see overloads and

191
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,959
one data center will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and serve from</font>

192
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,210
other other locations and at this point

193
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,320
I'm moving into<font color="#E5E5E5"> marketing and we got</font>

194
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:24,280
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who can talk to you about</font>

195
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,020
that in just to put a little more on

196
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,430
that remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aqua mais job is to</font>

197
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,520
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people can get served as</font>

198
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,170
quickly and reliably as possible

199
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,970
ignoring the the marketing side of this

200
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:35,650
if we see someone being throttled if we

201
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,480
we actually look at things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

202
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:39,250
retransmits if there's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> T speed</font>

203
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,590
retransmits will stop using that server

204
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:45,820
or stop sending that user to that server

205
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:46,930
that's the point of akamai so I'm not

206
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to lie</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say it's never</font>

207
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:50,500

208
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:53,410
overwhelming majority I mean very<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

209
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,700
90 percentage of our sessions are not

210
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:59,380
throttled at the data center of the

211
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:03,810
server level one more now we have two

212
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:06,240
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> out especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first point</font>

that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp statistics which we don't</font>

were the augment Buster's to the

declines you observe we do have that I

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know if we're allowed to give it</font>

these students are these statistics

provided to customers like if someone

you pay us will tell you anything but I

00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,890
quick question<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so they might be</font>

243
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:24,990
invested earlier I'm Jerry Newcombe the

244
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,120
is the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here representative a</font>

245
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:30,089
single TCP session or is it

246
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,000
like a parallel request sciences these

247
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:36,450
are these are broken down by single TCP

248
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:40,290
sessions not aggregate of TCP sessions

249
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:44,160
to a single client and another quirk i

250
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:46,980
mentioned there are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp experts here</font>

some of these measurements but that

would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> true in any case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks</font>

255
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:01,260
like that's it for the questions I

256
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:03,600
assume your analysts also noted that

257
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:06,029
countries with pirates were at the

258
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,160
bottom group and countries with ninja

259
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,510
we're at the top group and the countries

260
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,060
with Cowboys were in the milk anyway

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so Thank You</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean</font>
