00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:07,620
hi my name is Manish<font color="#E5E5E5"> courier I work at</font>

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:11,250
merrick networks today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be talking</font>

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,639
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem that has been coming up</font>

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,770
as a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an undertone to a lot of</font>

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,779
discussions in the hallways and at the

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,300
meeting here over the past in a couple

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,710
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years at least essentially the the</font>

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,300
problem that I'm trying to going to talk

9
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,150
about is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go about improving</font>

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,219
the accuracy of data in the routing

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,480
registry such as our<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATV so roughly what</font>

12
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:34,950
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about is I'm going to</font>

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about an ongoing project that we</font>

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,050
have that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> attempting to rebuild the</font>

15
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,968
RIT be at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> a client side of things</font>

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,769
not not a whole lot of changes on the

17
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,690
server and but at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> a client</font>

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,940
interface to provide a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of more</font>

19
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">information to the users so that they</font>

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,739
can they can try to they have bit more

21
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,270
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

22
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:59,419
their their route objects up to date and

23
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:03,780
in particular of what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is</font>

24
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:05,400
including both route object checks which

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,250
are internal to the registry as well as

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,369
providing a link with a live internet

27
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,710
route feed so once again we're providing

28
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:16,170
this link which has<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been missing</font>

29
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,179
which is you have registered<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

30
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,950
objects on one hand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the actual</font>

31
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,360
information that's get that gets routed

32
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,570
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand and</font>

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,159
the two are never never linked or never

34
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,570
put together in the same place and what

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,729
we're hoping is by making this link

36
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:32,429
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this information where</font>

37
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:34,140
they can they can update their objects

38
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,759
and keep them up to date and it's

39
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,170
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the motivation which we're</font>

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,119
providing them if you provide this

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,860
motivation you get better feedback and

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,790
you have better control of what you're

43
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,009
doing so some background quick

44
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,470
background information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the RDV</font>

45
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,079
it's based on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ird software which is</font>

46
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">available for free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> download but the RDP</font>

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,158
service is more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what we're</font>

48
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,469
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the router in registry is</font>

49
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,920
make prefix policy information publicly

50
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,350
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,060
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registered objects are in</font>

52
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:07,990
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl format which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard</font>

53
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,750
format and these days or up till now the

54
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,160
process of using the RDV has been you

55
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,319
create a maintainer account and you go

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,000
register your route objects a two-step

57
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">process and then if you need to do</font>

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,190
updates to the you you send email to a

59
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,049
specific email address with the right

60
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,730
format and it updates your route objects

61
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,950
or you can go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a website and</font>

62
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,359
update your route<font color="#E5E5E5"> objects that way the</font>

63
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,768
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> big drawbacks with this whole</font>

64
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,530
process up till now has been there was

65
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:34,569
no feedback to the user during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole</font>

66
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:38,290
process other than simple error checking

67
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:40,869
on your syntax is not right and the

68
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,910
other problem up till now has been that

69
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was no relationship between what</font>

70
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:48,010
you registered and what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually be</font>

71
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:50,620
routed on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so we're where</font>

72
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,329
we've started the<font color="#CCCCCC"> erd bng project at</font>

73
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:54,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">merit and what it does is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it essentially</font>

74
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,069
provides a portal based route object

75
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,750
maintenance framework and what you do

76
00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:01,089
when you have a portal a system as you

77
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,970
you you minimize the information that

78
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the user sees to specifically the</font>

79
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,840
objects that they've registered and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

80
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,510
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy for them to add delete and</font>

81
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,890
modify registry objects you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy</font>

82
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">for them to examine what they have</font>

83
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,059
registered and you provide quick summary

84
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:19,660
information so they have a rough idea of

85
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:21,670
how they are using the rdb and we also

86
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,700
provide feedback on inconsistencies that

87
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,200
we observe so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

88
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,709
internal consistency checks that we

00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">perform here's two examples of what we</font>

90
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,519
have implemented so far we do

91
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,650
consistency checks which where we

92
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,470
generate lists of all route objects that

93
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,390
do not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a matching object and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

94
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:42,609
we'll make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a make a recommendation to a</font>

95
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,048
drop-down list saying hey you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

96
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:45,340
a corresponding object which we think

97
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:48,790
you should have and would you like to

98
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,440
add it now another<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of an</font>

99
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:52,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">internal consistency check that we do is</font>

100
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,069
we generate lists of all prefixes that

101
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,109
have multiple route objects now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

102
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:58,208
be something that you intended but more

103
00:03:56,109 --> 00:03:59,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> likely you probably did and we give</font>

104
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:02,739
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user the option of going ahead and</font>

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,470
deleting the redundant route object so

106
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,379
once again<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can keep your information</font>

107
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">up-to-date the second type of</font>

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,000
with the loud

with the live Internet routing feet and

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,380
here's a an example of the sort of

112
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we look for for example we</font>

113
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,840
generate list of all the renounce routes

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:25,210
for your registered autonomous systems

115
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,919
we generate list of all unregistered

116
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,419
routes basically these are routes that

117
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,800
were seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rug table but you do</font>

advantage of the portal based system is

121
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,940
we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of what your</font>

123
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,630
go do these comparisons the results

<font color="#CCCCCC">specifics account another example is we</font>

126
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,640
generate list of all the announced route

you can go back and correct your BGP

133
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,539
feet or you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> up go back and update</font>

134

your ID be<font color="#E5E5E5"> objects and we also generate</font>

a list of unannounced objects just in

137
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,190
you would have the information there to

00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,690
modify that information and lastly one

139
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,620
of the the important checks we've also

140
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:22,300
added is the alerting system which which

looks at the update messages as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,380
good example of what quick example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">right now we're looking at the object</font>

152
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:49,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you see when you log in on the top</font>

153
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have summary information it lists</font>

154
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,580
all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route objects that are</font>

providing summary counts on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the</font>

157
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,330
bottom left we have drop-down<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists</font>

158
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,630
which which are prefixed lists

159
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,890
essentially of all these are the

160
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,169
drop-down lists which lets you select

161
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:09,940
which which object you would like to see

162
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:11,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information for and then finally on</font>

163
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right you will see</font>

164
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,229
details of what you've selected to view

165
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,719
and and you have a button right there to

second tab is the consistency check once

168
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,210
again on the Left we see a summary table

169
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,590
which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown / yes object that</font>

172
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,830
announced objects break down into by

173
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,750
broken down by numbers on the top again

174
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,419
you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop down list which lists</font>

175
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,710
each of these entries so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> select</font>

176
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:45,080
which one you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to view the detailed</font>

177
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,919

180
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,080

you want to view more<font color="#E5E5E5"> information on and</font>

182
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,979
finally on the bottom right you will

183
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,320
actually see that the the exact object

184
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:02,060
as its registered in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ra DB and you</font>

185
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,639
have the option<font color="#E5E5E5"> of editing deleting or</font>

186
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:06,470
adding information and finally the

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,880
alerting which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the feedback coming</font>

188
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,110
from a live update bgp update feed and

189
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,530
what you're seeing over here is the on

190
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:18,560
the top left you see you see alerts

191
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,059
where for your prefixes the a s and the

192
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,210
routing table was different from the es

193
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,919
that was registered in the Reeb and then

194
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,810
you will also see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table that lists</font>

195
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,599
what might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparent misconfigurations</font>

196
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,669

197
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:33,260
announcing some some some prefixes but

198
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:34,940
in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there they're shown</font>

199
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:37,010
up showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as belonging to somebody</font>

200
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,949

201
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,360
belonging to somebody else so finally a

202
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:43,039
quick summary of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've developed is</font>

203
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,229
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrated framework that provides</font>

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,139

206
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:52,039
includes feedback from various

207
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,169
consistency checks and what we've

208
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,870
actually done here is try to build the

209
00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:01,549
missing link between live Internet

210
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:03,500
routing data and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a DB and if you</font>

are we're currently in beta test we're
