00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,750
give you some<font color="#E5E5E5"> chance to have open</font>

have the student committee elections

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,579
rather than sort of leaving the election

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,289
give the candidates an opportunity to

23
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,229
say a few words we're then going to

be shortened if you wish now have

72
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:38,440

73
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,050

report from the purlin committee as and

80
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:58,929
the mailing list committee so we keep a

81
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:01,239
general watch over how they are

82
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:05,710
functioning help with any issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

forth highlight since<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nanak 43</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

84
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:09,100
some of the main things that pop up mean

85
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,100
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's been quite a bit of</font>

86
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,170
preparation work for nano<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44</font>

87
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,799
participating the engineering calls the

88
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:19,610
joint meeting with Erin

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:24,740
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as assessing future other</font>

90
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:27,080
network experiments we also finalized

91
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,750
the media situation at nano basically

92
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,919
who asked for policy regarding

93
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">complimentary registration or the media</font>

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,910
representatives so we had that

95
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,729
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of nano futures and well</font>

96
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,590
that's now on the website I don't know

97
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:43,480
if anybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking advantage of it yet</font>

98
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:46,729
so far no<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> least it is there now</font>

99
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,680
initial planning for Nanak 45 when I was

100
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,600
mostly will know nano 45 is going to

101
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,660
Dominican Republic which is taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,700
little bit more supposed effort to try

103
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,040
and do so we've been helping out with

104
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,039
that and we're also planning for future

105
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:03,110
now also trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get about an 18-month</font>

106
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,990
future planning window just so it

107
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,880
reduces the difficulty that merit have

108
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:11,570
with trying to find venues and and

109
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,800
handling the costs and so forth as well

110
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,690
as giving us the advantage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font>

111
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,820
promotion people can start planning the

112
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,860
travel with the various employers and so

113
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:22,540
forth and also lets<font color="#E5E5E5"> a probe committee</font>

114
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,310
get to work earlier for future events

115
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,020
many of you are seen the new website and

116
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:29,810
again the steering committee<font color="#E5E5E5"> helped</font>

117

Merritt with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> input with with</font>

119
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,020
together and we've also been taking a

120
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,330
look at some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> charter revisions</font>

121
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:42,830
which Steve will be talking about next

122
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:46,310
or in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit so mailing lists if you want</font>

123
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:48,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how to contact various things or</font>

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,580
nano to org is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main list for</font>

126
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,590
engineering operations discussion

127
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,159
engineering operations content is always

128
00:05:54,590 --> 00:06:00,619
highly welcomed there none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> futures is</font>

130
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,030
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about general nanog itself and</font>

131
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,860
where to go and how to go again is very

132

<font color="#E5E5E5">welcome on the Nano futures list it's</font>

133
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:13,250
been kind of quiet of late steering and

134
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,620
nanog is basically hard to contact us

135
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:20,360
the steering committee you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact</font>

136
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,490
the PC via the nano<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC address their</font>

137
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,620
think that's right and the mailing list

138
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,500
committee can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> at via Edmunds that</font>

139
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:32,000
none of the org

140
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,530
so any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> about any of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

141
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:40,530
before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual steering</font>

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that without confusing on every it's</font>

147
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:54,840
basically the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> no not going to</font>

148
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,310
calendar year there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are three positions</font>

149
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:02,039
available st members can only serve two

150
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,500
consecutive terms and then they must

151
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">take one year holiday before they become</font>

152
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:11,910
eligible again so Randy and I are the

153
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:13,740
first two people who are term limited so

154
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:17,700
we cannot stand again for another year

155
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,500
so we get a rest so this steering

156
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,490
committee will see at least two new

157
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:29,220
members in it going forwards which will

158
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:32,100

for years on this steering committees a

253
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,620
long time they both put in a year's

254
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,720
chair which is a rather thankless job

255
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,870
I'm herding cats but it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

why do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a charter what do we care</font>

260
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,969
it's like bylaws or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a constitution we're</font>

261
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:24,859
kind of a funny organization in that we

262
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,200
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist as a legal entity but we're</font>

263
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:30,140
an activity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> merit so everything we do</font>

264
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,270
is cut a colored by that but we have an

265
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:34,189
agreement as a community with merit that

266
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:36,260
we will behave like a community

267
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:38,779
organization that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow the</font>

268
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,010
Charter and marital fall of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter</font>

269
00:13:38,779 --> 00:13:45,860
to the extent possible and so far it's

270
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:48,709
worked really really well and we want to

271
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:53,390
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we have amendments so that</font>

272
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:56,089
we can fix mistakes during the general

273
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,010
election which is now amendments can be

276
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,149
one is by petition of membership there

student community we call procedure just

281
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:18,680
provides a way that the membership can

282
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:23,180
tell us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad job and</font>

about one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us off hopefully it'll</font>

never be needed but it's there for

288

member removal<font color="#E5E5E5"> commits committee member</font>

292
00:14:44,949 --> 00:14:51,878
removal basically this just adds text

293
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:54,129
luring that for a removal of program

294
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,959

295
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:59,289
two-thirds vote of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the steering</font>

297
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:04,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">something we would hope would be used</font>

298
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:07,869
often but it's there in case it's needed

299
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:11,439
third one is cleaning up<font color="#E5E5E5"> some language</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Charter the intent here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to fix</font>

301
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:16,238
mistakes spelling errors bad word

302
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:18,279
choices without actually changing the

303
00:15:16,239 --> 00:15:21,879
meeting of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter from what was</font>

304
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:23,470
intended the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is use of the</font>

305
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,879
word<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex-officio</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which I actually happen</font>

306
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:31,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look up once and it doesn't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

307
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:35,259
we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it bad so we're fixing that</font>

308
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:38,169
there's also one of them changes that I

309
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:40,509
didn't mention here but was kind of

310
00:15:38,169 --> 00:15:44,109
interesting changing the word

311
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:46,779
recommended to enacted in terms of

312
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:49,509
charter amendments the word recommended

313
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:52,769
was in the original charter because of

314
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:56,439
the relationship with merit<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

315
00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:58,899
but looking at it out of context it

316
00:15:56,439 --> 00:16:00,849
seemed to me to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly confusing so</font>

317
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:03,429
we're changing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look like it would</font>

318
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">in any other organization to say the</font>

00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:09,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Charter there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really doesn't change the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">way we do business Merritt still has the</font>

322
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,629
ultimate authority because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> control</font>

323
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:17,410
our money and they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the legal</font>

325
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,459
up except that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> language is more</font>

326
00:16:19,029 --> 00:16:24,269
clear so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the three minutes we</font>

that replicated perfectly but I did

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,540
actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together this particular</font>

357
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:45,090
slapdash presentation myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go</font>

358
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:47,159
fast my main intent for this

359
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,600
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to clarify for those of</font>

360
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,040
you who are not in the know what the

361
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,980
heck the program committee is and

362
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,720
somehow encourage you to either submit a

363
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,220
bunch of fantastic talks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

364
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting under your hat that you've just</font>

365
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,230
neglected to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us about or better yet</font>

366
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to volunteer for the program committee</font>

367
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,460
so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are my two goals we will see</font>

368
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,080
whether they are accomplished so the

369
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,610
program committee just<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is is</font>

370
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,710
we're responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for putting together</font>

371
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:13,860
the program we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are selected by the</font>

372
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:17,160
steering committee there's 16 of us all

373
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:19,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">over the world and we do a lot of stuff</font>

374
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,059
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular we recruit talks we</font>

375
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,470
recruit a lot of talks because<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of</font>

376
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:24,629
you who know anything about the way

377
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,220
networks work don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any time to put</font>

378
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,690
together<font color="#CCCCCC"> a presentation about any of the</font>

379
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:29,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">things you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know and so it takes us</font>

380
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,200
bugging you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> create the sort</font>

381
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,090
of circumstance where you would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

382
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,600
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our job is to bother you and</font>

383
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:38,399
so that's why we're so popular we review

384
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,919
the talks once we have recruited them

385
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,660
and some of them are quite bad and many

386
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,890
of them are quite fantastic and most of

387
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,230
them are somewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle and</font>

388
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:48,870
need a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of help or need some</font>

389
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:51,059
direction we organize those talks into

390
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fantastic program that you see here</font>

before you on those little sheets of

392
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:58,320
paper and we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them together into this</font>

393
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,399
conference so program committee members

network engineers and operators and

444
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,490
here's the reality is that most of you

445
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:08,080
have been

446
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:10,420
I want Lee are in voting most of your

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,149
cases not so silently saying for many

448
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:14,830
conferences what crap you think the

449
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,150
program is and here's your chance to

450
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,740
show us<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

451
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,750
together a better program because we

452
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,520
think you can do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're frankly not</font>

453
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:23,890
that good at<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're very good at it</font>

454
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">but you could be better at it some quick</font>

455
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:29,550
metrics we got 36 total submissions 23

accepted<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 withdrawn and 10 declined</font>

457
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,320
that's pretty par for the course we used

458
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,240
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically not decline anything we</font>

459
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,669
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like declining things but</font>

460
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,220
the evidence of having some talks that

461
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:44,530
we didn't accept shows us that we didn't

462
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,940
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> take you know the the talks we</font>

463
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,990
could to fill up the space that there's

464
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,820
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of people who</font>

465
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,740
submitted talks that were either<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

468
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:55,389

469
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:57,370
reject talked in general we try to

470
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,020
provide specific feedback about what we

471
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,729
thought was inappropriate about the talk

472
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,250
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> audience and how people might</font>

473

make it better in some cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that's</font>

474
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not possible in some cases it's it</font>

475
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:11,320
is in most cases it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> NaN</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on 45 is</font>

476
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,510
going to Santo Domingo we are very very

477
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">excited</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that there's a ton of</font>

482
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,410
a bunch of events that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sort of</font>

483
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,540
swirling in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the air around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's</font>

484
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,030
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> a peering event after nanog</font>

485
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,340
there's likely a lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick event right</font>

486
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:36,660
on the beginning of nanog so there's the

487
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,909
potential for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week and a half long</font>

488
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,650
justified time period in<font color="#E5E5E5"> January in</font>

babysitting for you if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

and I personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> loved Toronto in</font>

497
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,210
February I really did I thought it was

498
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:03,790
fantastic but y'all griped about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

499
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:05,890
lot you guys grumbled about it a lot and

500
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:08,920
so this being an organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> of extreme</font>

501
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,110
overreaction this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to</font>

502
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,450
februari in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Toronto what we've done is</font>

acceptance<font color="#E5E5E5"> schedule for this conference</font>

508
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:25,389
because many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to have to</font>

509
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,430
go through extra large corporate

510
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,170
bureaucratic hoops to get travel

511
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:31,360
justification because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US although it's not so much outside</font>

514
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,820
of a draft program out there so that

515
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:42,429
travel justifications can have something

516
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">substantial attached to them so if you</font>

2005<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit actually ran the mailing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

526
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:29,380
and the community spoke out and said

527
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,879
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to take control of the</font>

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:34,960
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of her own destiny</font>

529
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,700
here and we had ourselves written into

530
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter so that we could govern</font>

531
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:44,440
ourselves we do work with rules and

532
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,060
they're an acceptable use policy this is

533
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,560
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's owned by the steering</font>

534
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">committee and not by the mailing list</font>

535
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">committee our job is basically to</font>

536
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:55,570
enforce those rules if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

537
00:24:52,990 --> 00:25:01,290
read<font color="#CCCCCC"> more about this interesting subject</font>

538
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:04,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can click on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that link there so</font>

539
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:07,000
right now the mailing list is composed

540
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,400
of four<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are selected by the</font>

541
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,380
steering committee we're volunteers

542
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:16,680
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> David barrack</font>

543
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:18,420
Simon Lyle Tim<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yoakam and myself the</font>

544
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,280
steering committee has one of their own

545
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,250
representatives on the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

546
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:27,500
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that we're not running out of</font>

547
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:30,780
control<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zoo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Joyner who</font>

548
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:34,170
merit appoints to sit on the mailing

549
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:36,620
list committee at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of this nanog</font>

550
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:44,730
there's actually two spots opening up

551
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:46,530
that's Tim and David so what do we do

552
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:50,400
what do we don't do we don't write the

553
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:53,970
AUP but we do moderate the list

554
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,520
according to the AUP our approach so far

555
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,890
has been very light handed we've been

556
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,820
contacting people off list we haven't

557
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:08,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">been really intervening directly in the</font>

558
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:14,010
threads we have been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

559
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:15,870
consistent in who we contact and under

560
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:20,850
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> circumstances were contacting them</font>

561
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:24,770
so if you're on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad list then don't</font>

562
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:24,770
worry you<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't been singled out</font>

563
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,940
everybody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been warned has</font>

564
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,410
been worn into the same conditions and

565
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,630
if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else has met those conditions</font>

566
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:39,330
we've warned them as well but you're not

567
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to hear about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it what the mailing</font>

568
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,810
list committee would like to ask of you

572
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:53,399
and we're really looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the people</font>

573
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,909
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are posting the people that are</font>

posting quality content to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

gentle nudges to the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that aren't</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">quite posting things that we find</font>

acceptable things that aren't

operational or engineering or technical

579
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:14,310
a few statistics for you you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

580
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:15,659
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is almost 10,000 subscribers so</font>

581
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,639
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you send a message there's</font>

582
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:22,110
potentially 10,000 people that are

583
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,040
reading it you can see the number of

584
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,229
posts the

585
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,620
we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> per month and we've actually</font>

586
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:31,440
had relatively few reminders sent out to

587
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:33,659
people about the AUP you can see in

588
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,110
October so far today we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send</font>

589
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:43,050
out nine there was a one list that got a

590
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:45,330
little political a note of control there

591
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:48,120
are two other lists for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to use</font>

592
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:51,240
there's the nanog attendee list which if

593
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,330
you register<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the conference you had</font>

594
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,600
a choice to opt out from it so we had

595
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,889
appreciate social messages going<font color="#E5E5E5"> off to</font>

596
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,870
this list so that we can keep

597
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,790
operational stuff on the nanog list and

598
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,070
if you want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the nanog list</font>

599
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:08,159
or nanog in general there's nanog

600
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:13,409
futures so meta discussions not

601
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:14,760
appropriate for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in August if you</font>

00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:17,289
registered registered attendees and

644
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,559
those are pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers they're</font>

645
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:22,658
kind of our our minimum of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

646
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:25,360
to break even and the types of people

647
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:31,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">who attended so speaking of breaking</font>

648
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:33,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">even this is what the the financials</font>

649
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,919
were for Brooklyn it's a black number at

650
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,949
the bottom and I like black however i

651
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:42,639
would have liked a little bit larger

652
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:45,130
black number but you know you take what

653
00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:47,080
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get attendance looks pretty good</font>

654
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,789
here so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get some one of</font>

655
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,850
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we talked about was trying to</font>

656
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:54,039
plan meetings further out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> married is</font>

657
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:56,918
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> non-profit nanog is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> non-profit line</font>

658
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:58,929
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> of merit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

659
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:02,230
profits<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we try and build a reserve</font>

660
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:04,779
and we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to build a reserve</font>

661
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,639
enough so that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go out</font>

662
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:10,120
and make these arrangements for these

663
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,559
venues in advance so so we need to put a

664
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,889
little more money into the reserve

665
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:17,559
before we can with good conscious go out

666
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:22,658
and make commitments for for these

667
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:23,918
venues and as you elect members of

668
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:26,500
steering committee we work with the

669
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">steering committee to try and to make</font>

671
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,559
like venues and number fees and so forth

672
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:37,658
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see we're getting by we</font>

673
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:40,690
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nana odd more valuable to</font>

00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:45,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">some limits as we come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into uncertain</font>

676
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:47,168
times financially so the next steering

677
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,549
community that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you elect we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

679
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:53,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these numbers stay in the black and</font>

00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:55,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are lots of options some of them</font>

681
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,120
are just raising the the attendance fees

682
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,529
many of you who registered at the last

683
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,330
minute we appreciate because of course

684
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:03,789
you pay more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it helps us for an out</font>

685
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:05,678
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the black but it does make make for a</font>

686
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:08,590
little bit more exciting times I keep

687
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,799
asking Betty how we doing on tennis and

688
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:14,230
she fills me in as we become into that

689
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:16,899
there are other<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of things that we</font>

690
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:19,149
could do we could hold nanog in places

691
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:20,408
that are not as expensive which means

692
00:32:19,149 --> 00:32:22,928
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably have to change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> planes</font>

693
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:24,399
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know that may be an</font>

694
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:26,830
option but these are the things the

695
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,289
steering committee will represent you on

696
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,360
or we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more aggressive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

697
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:32,860
sponsors get them to kick in more money

698
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:36,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that would mean they probably have</font>

699
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:39,580
more access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you but but think about</font>

700
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:42,159
that and think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how nanog can be</font>

701
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:43,600
more valuable to you and realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

702
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,090
the steering committee will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones</font>

703
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you will speak for you so when you</font>

00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,700
steering committee keep those things in

706
00:32:49,779 --> 00:32:55,860
mind tell the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that you elect</font>

707
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:57,630
what your thoughts are<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that they can</font>
