1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,960
can snoop or modify all traffic that

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Allison's so really when we're talking</font>

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,519
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> host authentication and building a</font>

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,309
peek at really the only question we're

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,110
trying to answer is is this key really

6
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:18,540
belong to the person that I think I'm

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to talk to that's essentially</font>

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,049
what this talk is about so the first

9
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,759
question you probably want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask is</font>

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,470
hope do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to carry about</font>

11
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:27,059
care about this stuff you know people

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up with hypothetical attacks all</font>

13
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,119
the time and I would argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:31,829
unfortunately you do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about</font>

15
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,660
man-in-the-middle attacks and in fact

16
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:36,390
you probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to care about them a</font>

17
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,800
lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> now than you used to there are</font>

18
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,330
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple recent trends that increase</font>

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,279
man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability

20
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,879
the first is probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's distracting</font>

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,140
you right now that's a wireless network

22
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,240
basically so much of our connectivity

23
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,030
these days is over wireless but a shared

24
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,460
wireless LAN lets you spoof ARP and DNS

25
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,739
packets for example there's the recent

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">ARP I framework so really when you're</font>

27
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,709
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a man-in-the-middle</font>

28
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,120
attack your mental model probably

29
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,280
shouldn't be Mallory in a dark room

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,140
typing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on some keyboard but should</font>

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,270
really be a compromise laptop for

32
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,950
example that's using man-in-the-middle

33
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:14,179
attacks to snoop logins or to inject on

34
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,470
inject content<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your web session</font>

35
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,880
another problem that's increasing

36
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,850
man-in-the-middle attack vulnerability

37
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,890
is growing prevalence of home routers

38
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,270
and access points that have known

39
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,950
vulnerabilities these are the so-called

40
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,440
farming attacks that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

41
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,390
read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on yahoo or other you know</font>

42
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,399
mainstream media that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a farming ooh</font>

43
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,920
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the fact of the matter is</font>

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,740
that these have these devices have<font color="#E5E5E5"> known</font>

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,180
vulnerabilities and chances are you know

46
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,979
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times when you connect your</font>

47
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,180
connecting at some coffee shop or the

48
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,179
person actually in charge of running

49
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,770
this access point you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

50
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,110
main responsibility is making<font color="#E5E5E5"> good latte</font>

51
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,640
it's not running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a secure network so</font>

52
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,929
that's another reason you might be

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,390
worried about man-in-the-middle attacks

54
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:56,670
and finally you're probably all sick of

55
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,890
hearing about the Kaminski DNS attacks

56
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,299
that was yet another attack factor that

57
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,790
we've seen come out and come out

58
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,799
recently that allows someone to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

59
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:09,810
Mallory in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle so those of you</font>

60
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,150
that have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of following</font>

61
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,810
following security trends should also be

62
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,550
interested in

63
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,720
that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these attacks these</font>

64
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">man-in-middle-attacks have become</font>

65
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,800
increasingly automated and<font color="#E5E5E5"> profit driven</font>

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,359
which might set up a red flag<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

67
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,480
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> worried worried about them</font>

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,090
becoming a bigger problem in the future

69
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,709
so you know man middle tax are nothing

70
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,760
new in fact they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been around for you</font>

71
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:32,550
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> as long as the internet has been</font>

72
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">around people propose solutions well</font>

73
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,420
there's two major solutions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

74
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,459
both use you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and maybe you both use</font>

75
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,958
every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first is a public key</font>

76
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,420
infrastructure this is where a

77
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,950
certificate authority like verisign take

78
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,109
some of your cash and gives you a

79
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,690
certificate saying that you know you do

80
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,080
own this domain name the second

81
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:54,390
mechanism is prayer now that may sound a

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,080
little weird but if you've ever just

83
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:00,569
typed yes at an<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH prompt or clicked ok</font>

84
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,040
to accept a self-signed certificate

85
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,579
you're trusting a bit of your internet

86
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,679
security it's some higher authority so

87
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,709
what exactly do I mean by prayer well

88
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,910
first of all you know in academia we can

89
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:13,950
never get away<font color="#CCCCCC"> with calling something</font>

90
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,470
prayer authentication so we're going to

91
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:18,929
refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this prayer mechanism is ssh</font>

92
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,260
style authentication so what exactly do

93
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,299
we mean well ssh style authentication

94
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,519
the basic steps go something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

95
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,319
first when you first connect to a new

96
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,670
server you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically pray that there's</font>

97
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,369
no adversary on the first connection

98
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:34,649
then you cash the key you keep

99
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,269
connecting and everything's fine as long

100
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,920
as the key changes but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the key of our</font>

101
00:03:36,269 --> 00:03:40,739
changes you panicked<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't know what</font>

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,809
to do so what do you do well a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

103
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:47,910
are guilty probably praying again and

104
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,829
just connecting anyway right well why

105
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:51,630
would anyone use prayer this sounds

106
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:54,060
silly you know we have this PK I think

107
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,269
we figured this out move on well the

108
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:01,829
fact that matter is PK is that unlike

109
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:03,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">API using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH is cheap and simple right</font>

110
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,220
so they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> something right there they</font>

111
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">just weren't so strong on the security</font>

112
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:12,150
parts think about what a pain a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki can</font>

113
00:04:08,579 --> 00:04:14,310
be so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say a PK I mean is secure</font>

114
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,048
pki well we'll get maybe we can debate

115
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:18,120
that later<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know whether all PK is</font>

116
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:20,638
they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually secure but a secure</font>

117
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">pki is often costly because the</font>

118
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,500
certificate authority has to manually

119
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,599
verify that you are the

120
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:29,080
in your head you say you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it</font>

121
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,000
can grant you a certificate plus I is a

122
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,490
server administrator have to manually

123
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,550
generate a cert you know email does the

124
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:38,350
the certificate signing request into the

125
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,940
certificate authority get the response

126
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,620
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and manual install it have to do</font>

127
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> for each one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my servers every</font>

128
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">year and this admin costs also also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

129
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,320
another reason traditional PK<font color="#E5E5E5"> eyes are</font>

130
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,550
not simple to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use so you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font>

131
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">when was the last time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did any of</font>

132
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">these concerns about SSH SSH is a</font>

133
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,810
straight model you just plug it in and

134
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,640
it starts working right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

135
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">is one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons we saw SSH</font>

136
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,030
just very quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and vigorously replace</font>

137
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,619
the completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> insecure talent so what</font>

138
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,150
we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> with perspectives was kind of</font>

139
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,310
look at this model and say there are a

140
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,840
lot of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this very simple SSH</font>

141
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,120
style authentication that we'd like to

142
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,190
keep basically the simplicity of

143
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,950
administrating the servers and the low

144
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost of verifying the identity of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

145
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,479
of the server owner but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course we</font>

146
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:27,210
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve the attack resistance so</font>

147
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,260
those are that's kind of the key

148
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,380
principles that are driving<font color="#CCCCCC"> our design</font>

149
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,960
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective so here's the 10,000</font>

150
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:38,050
foot view in pictures of how

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,349
perspectives works so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob calm</font>

152
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,910
and Bob pops up with the Internet's pops

153
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,560
up onto the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet at some point he</font>

154
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,940
doesn't in our scenario he doesn't

155
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,470
contact a certificate authority at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

156
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:51,160
he just generates a key just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like your</font>

157
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:52,660
ssh server would so perspectives uses a

158
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,430
set of nodes scattered across the

159
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet that we refer to as network</font>

160
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,310
notaries so once the network notaries

161
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,679
learn about Bob they periodically mimic

162
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,600
clients and just ping Bob with requests

163
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,790
they connect to Bob they say hey Bob you

164
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what's your public key Bob responds</font>

165
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:12,880
and they build up a history of the key

166
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:14,590
history of the keys used by Bob<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm no</font>

167
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,969
no Bob calm doesn't actually have to

168
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:17,020
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network notaries</font>

169
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,640
connecting because these<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

170
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,070
notaries just look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal clients</font>

171
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,740
to Bob calm so Bob calm doesn't need to

172
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,870
be modified at all so let's return to

173
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,660
our original example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Alice connecting</font>

174
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Bob calm so Ellis again is going to</font>

175
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,400
send a hello to Bob calm

176
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was going to send back the key now the</font>

177
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">future will refer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this key that Alice</font>

178
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,550
received directly from the untrusted

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network which he hopes is from Bob calm</font>

180
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,810
as the offered key of course the

181
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:46,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">question she again wants to answer is is</font>

182
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:49,169
this really Bob<font color="#E5E5E5"> coms key what well in</font>

183
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,229
perspectives what Alice can do is query

184
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:54,060
the notary's and this this is actually

185
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> communication will go over the</font>

186
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,099
details later<font color="#E5E5E5"> but Alice gets back a set</font>

187
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,840
of keys<font color="#E5E5E5"> are key histories from each of</font>

188
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,389
the notary's and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call</font>

189
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,758
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notary observations and then</font>

190
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:07,889
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice basically does is runs a</font>

191
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,169
client policy which is just a fancy name

192
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:12,389
for she does a kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a basic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sanity</font>

193
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:15,270
and consistency check does the offered

194
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:17,550
key i received make sense in terms of

195
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:19,500
the of the notary observations and if

196
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,810
they are consistent she will accept and

197
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,430
use the key to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Bob calm if</font>

198
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,750
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are inconsistent she will</font>

199
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,699
determine that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to attack</font>

200
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:31,500
or something suspicious she'll reject

201
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:33,330
the key and abort the connection so what

202
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:35,310
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> protection can this system</font>

203
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,109
actually give you well we talked about

204
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,449
the protection that perspectives offers

205
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:43,740
in terms of two types of resistance the

206
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:45,330
first is spatial resistance so<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

207
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,710
notaries probe<font color="#E5E5E5"> from all over the</font>

208
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,409
internet and so they give you multiple

209
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,448
vantage points oftentimes attackers are

210
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:53,219
localized in a particular area for

211
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,069
example your wireless network or they

212
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:59,279
come or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromise a few DNS</font>

213
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:02,159
servers that way for weak attackers that

214
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,539
are localized<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network notaries provide</font>

215
00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,969
these multiple vantage points that can

216
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:09,628
easily let Alice detect that this is an

217
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:11,430
attack well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about really powerful</font>

218
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:12,870
network adversaries<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

219
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,449
perspectives offer something called

220
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:18,089
temporal resistant<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is the history</font>

221
00:08:15,449 --> 00:08:20,189
of the key the keys over time can

222
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:22,979
actually let Alice potentially detect an

223
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:27,389
attack even if Mallory is on all paths

224
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,860
between all notaries and Bob so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

225
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:30,599
see that when during<font color="#E5E5E5"> normal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

226
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,130
circumstances the notaries are probing

227
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,429
and building up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key history of Bob's</font>

228
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,698
legitimate key at some point Mallory

229
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:41,179
gets on all Network paths between

230
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:43,609
between um Alice all of the node

231
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,819
raised in Bob and so we see even the

232
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">notaries report incorrect results right</font>

233
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,760
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the notaries don't know what's</font>

234
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,839
right or wrong they just know what key

235
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,950
they're getting when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

236
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,720
connect to Bob calm and so the point

237
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:58,520
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that Alice can look at this key</font>

238
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,649
history notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was a sudden</font>

239
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,110
change and be suspicious of that and

240
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:05,240
potentially reject the key so what we

241
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,339
see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is with temporal redundancy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

242
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,770
spatial redundancy we get a model that's

243
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">not bulletproof but is significantly</font>

244
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:15,290
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH model so by now you</font>

245
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,149
probably have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of practical</font>

246
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,310
questions buzzing on your head like hey

247
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:22,100
who runs these note of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your things or</font>

248
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,050
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly are the notaries doing when</font>

249
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,660
they when they contact the clients or

250
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,550
sorry when they contact the servers and

251
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,380
more most importantly how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do clients</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

252
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,569
this data from the notaries and actually

253
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,649
decide to accept or reject a key so now

254
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,920
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look at some of</font>

255
00:09:33,649 --> 00:09:38,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">these questions so first off who's going</font>

256
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,610
to run these<font color="#E5E5E5"> network notaries well the</font>

257
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,020
short answer is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's one</font>

258
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the reasons I'm here talking you guys</font>

259
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,100
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a couple models first</font>

260
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:49,160
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be someone you know someone</font>

261
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,480
with money and with kind of the will to

262
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,880
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet someone like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

263
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,740
Mozilla or Google or an eff basically

264
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,630
says listen buying these network notary

265
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,459
server is you know hardware super cheap

266
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,520
bandwidth super cheap let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just make</font>

267
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:03,430
this happen another possibility and one

268
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,990
of the main reasons I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is</font>

269
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:08,209
we think there might be useful community

270
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,670
deployment model in which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> peas</font>

271
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:14,660
universities you know web hosting

272
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:17,300
companies etc each volunteer to run a

273
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,800
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> network notary node now this kind</font>

274
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,000
of a model<font color="#E5E5E5"> where everyone pitches in a</font>

275
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,770
little bit is actually not with that

276
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">president many of you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

277
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,949
familiar with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the network of</font>

publicly<font color="#CCCCCC"> available traceroute and</font>

279
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,390
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> last servers that exists for</font>

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,140
diagnosing networking problems in

281
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:35,779
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there's planet lap or</font>

282
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,939
test beds like<font color="#E5E5E5"> planet lab and Ron have</font>

283
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,850
actually been built by universities and

284
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:43,180
ISPs donating one or two

285
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,889
machines at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time now well we don't</font>

286
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:46,000
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the details well I don't</font>

287
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">really have time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get in the details</font>

288
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">during this talk kind of a fundamental</font>

289
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:52,930
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the perspectives design and</font>

290
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,209
security analysis assumes that some

291
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:58,060
notaries at any given point in time may

292
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:59,739
be malicious are compromised and so we

293
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:04,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">really did design with this kind of</font>

294
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:05,529
community deployment model in mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

295
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so when we're talking about these</font>

296
00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network notice how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many are we are we</font>

297
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:11,769
thinking well the short answer is we

298
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:13,599
don't totally know in fact I have a

299
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:16,690
strong disagree with my advisors<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

300
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,970
this but I would imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere in</font>

301
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:22,089
the realm of 10 to 30 global vantage

302
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,130
points um would be what we want some of

303
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:25,540
these servers may actually want you know

304
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:27,310
have multiple servers in a particular

305
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">location for redundancy or load</font>

306
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:32,859
balancing depending on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many people</font>

307
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,979
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the system so what else is</font>

308
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:37,750
necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the system happen well</font>

309
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,610
any client software that is going to use

310
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:42,519
this needs to be shipped with a master

311
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,430
key and this master key basically

312
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,709
bootstraps the trust and so daily the

313
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,870
clients will contact the central Central

314
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:52,180
notary<font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority they'll download a new</font>

315
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,490
list and say what notaries are part of

316
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,349
the notary system and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are their</font>

317
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,410
public keys and right we'll need this

318
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:03,569
information in a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> steps in order</font>

319
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,920
to securely connect to the notaries so

320
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next question we want to look at is</font>

321
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,630
what exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens within us within a</font>

322
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,519
particular notary well you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

323
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,560
the notaries logically being broken into

324
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:16,420
two different components the first

325
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,569
component of the probing modules of the

326
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,779
second is a notary database probing

327
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:24,069
modules are really just a fancy name for

328
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:26,680
software that mimics<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behavior of a</font>

329
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:28,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">client basically this protocol specific</font>

330
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:32,079
modules that can connect to the server

331
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:35,350
and grab public keys and then disconnect

332
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,449
and so on a daily basis the network

333
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:39,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">Notre basically looks at every service</font>

334
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:42,459
it knows about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this database sends a</font>

335
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:45,008
query to it acts like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client once once</font>

336
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:47,170
the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSL session or the ssh session</font>

337
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:49,660
has exchanged the public key they

338
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,540
disconnect and they update the results

339
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,459
of the database

340
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:55,079
so what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly in this database well</font>

341
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,390
that's zero in on a particular record

342
00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,540
for an imaginary domain called shop<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm</font>

343
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:03,330
so each record in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> database is is</font>

344
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,810
identified by<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS name a port and</font>

345
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocol used to probe and so each of</font>

346
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:11,279
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> records will contain one or more</font>

347
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,680
keys here we represent them as md5 sums

348
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,900
and each key will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> associated with one</font>

349
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,729
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> more time spans you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

350
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,860
rocket science all we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just</font>

351
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:21,330
basically recording you know recording

352
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,270
the keys we've seen at a different time

353
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:28,110
at um ever since we've been probing this

354
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,490
host and so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one more thing we</font>

355
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,740
had which is a signature which is

356
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,930
updated each time<font color="#CCCCCC"> the notary probes and</font>

357
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:38,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this signature is created using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

358
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">notaries private key so let's look at an</font>

359
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:45,570
example now where a client<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Firefox</font>

360
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:48,089
wants to use notary data well we need to

361
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,010
extend the client with a slight amount

362
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:51,630
of extra code in order to do this query

363
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,620
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> notaries and running the client</font>

364
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:58,110
policy and so this notary client code

365
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically when Firefox</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> connect</font>

366
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">co-domain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the notary client code will</font>

367
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:06,029
generate a notary request with the

368
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,250
protocol the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS name in the port and</font>

369
00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:10,890
send it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the notary now these queries</font>

370
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,810
are done over DNS so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> UDP</font>

371
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:15,209
Datagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry these are unity via</font>

372
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:16,709
grams that are similar to DNS we're

373
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:19,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually looking at a possibility of</font>

374
00:14:16,709 --> 00:14:22,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">running this entire system over DNS we'd</font>

375
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,020
be interested in your feedback but um so

376
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,880
when the client gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> this result back</font>

377
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,800
first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does is verified the</font>

378
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,390
signature right<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is very important</font>

379
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,010
because if an attacker is launching a

380
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:33,900
man-in-the-middle attack and could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

381
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,730
spoof notary responses there'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

382
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:40,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the designing the system at</font>

383
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:42,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">all so finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the big question what do</font>

384
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">clients due to determine whether they</font>

385
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,310
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept or reject a key well as</font>

386
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,630
we mentioned in the overview slide

387
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,529
essentially what they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

388
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:52,360
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> your spatial and temporal</font>

389
00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:53,649
systemc now there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of</font>

390
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">different approaches you can imagine</font>

391
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,790
this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at just kind of two</font>

392
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,120
primary approaches that you might use

393
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:03,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first is manual keep key policies</font>

394
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,470
these are what you might do if you know

395
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:07,660
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some power users like you or me</font>

396
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:09,730
for example there are very familiar with

397
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:11,050
security and you know all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> details</font>

398
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:12,670
and you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be told more</font>

399
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,420
information so you know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

400
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:18,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">safe to accept or reject this key so</font>

401
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,529
notary client might tell you something

402
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:22,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 or 6 notaries have consistently</font>

403
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,399
seen the offered key for the past 200

404
00:15:22,569 --> 00:15:27,759
days this personally would make me feel

405
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,199
pretty good about accepting this key now

406
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,639
there's some other things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might</font>

407
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,790
see that would actually make me pretty

408
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,889
worried such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 of 6 notaries</font>

409
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:38,230
currently see a different key that would

410
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:39,819
lead me to believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that there might</font>

411
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,129
be an attack now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a moment</font>

412
00:15:39,819 --> 00:15:45,639
compare this to what SSH tells you right

413
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:48,430
now it says hey I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this key</font>

414
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:50,199
cash do you want to trust it right so

415
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:52,779
you can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how having this</font>

416
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,729
extra notary data really lets you

417
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:56,379
determine whether there's likely to be a

418
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:59,559
real attack or whether this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just a</font>

419
00:15:56,379 --> 00:16:02,110
spurious warning so essentially what a

420
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:04,240
power user is doing here is looking at

421
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:06,069
the notary data and saying is they're

422
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,959
kind of there enough evidence that they

423
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:11,469
offered key is correct that it passes

424
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:14,369
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consistency threshold well</font>

425
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,930
thankfully this kind of same consistent

426
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,519
consistency threshold logic can actually

427
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:21,339
be automated because let's be honest

428
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:23,139
most<font color="#CCCCCC"> Firefox</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users have no idea what a</font>

429
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:25,750
man-in-the-middle attack is or even what

430
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:28,720
a public he is so being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to automate</font>

431
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,970
these policies is very valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

432
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,490
what perspectives actually lets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

433
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:36,370
is it allows the user to make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

434
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:39,670

prefer very very strong security even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

436
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,410
it means i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to disconnect in some</font>

437
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:46,000
cases when when the key is valid or they

438
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:48,730
can make the choice where I prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">availability even if it means a very</font>

440
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,740
powerful attacker might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to trick</font>

441
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:55,689
me so let's take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at two example</font>

442
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,810
policies that could be converted<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

443
00:16:55,689 --> 00:16:59,839
automated threshold

444
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:02,540
so first of all you could configure your

445
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:05,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Firefox to say that any time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

446
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,010
key that's self-signed unless one

447
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:09,230
hundred percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the notary's have</font>

448
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:11,569
seen the same key for the past three

449
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:14,000
days<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to reject it well what does</font>

450
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:16,790
this policy really say really<font color="#E5E5E5"> says that</font>

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,910
I want very high security if anything

452
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:22,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">seems even remotely suspicious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

453
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:25,339
be super safe and disconnect of course

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,530
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> users might not want that another</font>

455
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:30,050
policy that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> high availability policy</font>

456
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:32,060
would say that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all i care</font>

457
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,770
about is that at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know fifty</font>

458
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:35,240
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the notary's currently see</font>

459
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:37,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> offered key and I don't really care</font>

460
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,380
about any of the history really<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

461
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,510
person is saying you know I really value

462
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,370
my my ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect to the server I</font>

463
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,900
never want I<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost never want to be</font>

464
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,449
able to not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> connect to the</font>

465
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,130
server but and I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font>

466
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,750
protection against very simple attacks

467
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:53,390
like I want to make sure someone's not

468
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,740
on my local Wi-Fi network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see that</font>

469
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:59,540
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we automate these key policies</font>

470
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:02,179
users can still make<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level choices</font>

471
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:06,290
whether they want to prefer security or

472
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:08,090
availability and of course I'm glossing

473
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:10,850
over lots and lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> details here which</font>

474
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:13,639
you can all read<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in our paper and</font>

475
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:15,020
we also tie these on the different

476
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,510
thresholds and the different threshold

477
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:19,790
parameters to our security analysis so

478
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:21,440
any of this is remotely interesting i'd

479
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:24,678
encourage you to check out the website

480
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,679
and check out the paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what's</font>

481
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:29,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> story so far well we've already said</font>

482
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,940
that tradition the traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> PKM model</font>

483
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,730
is costly costly and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pain in</font>

484
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,500
the butt to use well what perspectives

485
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,020
does is that it retains the good parts

486
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,000
of ssh style authentication that is its

487
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">low cost gives probes or super cheap</font>

488
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,130
bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> is g and it's super simple</font>

489
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:47,720
because server administrators don't have

490
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,179
to do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> special they don't have</font>

491
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,400
to manual install certs or communicate

492
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the certificate authority but what</font>

493
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,029
we've done is with spatial and temporal

494
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,889
redundancy we've greatly improved

495
00:18:56,029 --> 00:18:59,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">hack resistance of the standard ssh</font>

496
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:01,639
model so what we're left with is

497
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:03,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's not bulletproof but</font>

498
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:06,379
might be useful might provide a useful

499
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:09,289
security trade-off for some non-security

500
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:12,049
critical websites so now what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

501
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:15,499
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is look at three potential uses</font>

502
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:16,789
for perspectives in the real world the

503
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:18,529
first is something we've actually

504
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:21,799
already been using perspectives to do

505
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:25,999
which is to strengthen on existing uses

506
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:28,309
of ssh in ssl against the tax as many of

507
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:30,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are probably aware Firefox and</font>

508
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:32,450
Internet Explorer recently made changes

509
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,029
that make<font color="#CCCCCC"> as self-signed certificates</font>

510
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,159
essentially security errors and it's a

511
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:39,499
real pain in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the butt to use on these</font>

512
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,739
web browsers with<font color="#CCCCCC"> with cell science</font>

513
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:44,839
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> now so we've actually written a</font>

514
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:47,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">Firefox extension that automatically</font>

515
00:19:44,839 --> 00:19:49,580
queries the notary's and will<font color="#E5E5E5"> override</font>

516
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:51,259
these error pages if the notary results

517
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,928
provide strong evidence that there's no

518
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:56,419
no attacks we've actually had over

519
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,099
10,000 people download this and so

520
00:19:56,419 --> 00:20:00,440
apparently they find it useful or at

521
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:02,059
least interesting so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one place</font>

522
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">where I think perspectives</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

523
00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:05,629
definitely have an impact a couple more

524
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these that might be a little more</font>

525
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:12,228
contentious but what the hell go for so

526
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the second is that perspectives might be</font>

527
00:20:12,229 --> 00:20:16,700
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> attractive alternative to the low-end</font>

528
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,489
see a signed certificate market that

529
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,889
exists today so what do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean by the</font>

530
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:22,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">low end cert market well for those of</font>

531
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,738
you that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been paying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

532
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:26,509
attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pique eyes and well maybe</font>

533
00:20:24,739 --> 00:20:29,779
that's just me cuz i'm a big dork but

534
00:20:26,509 --> 00:20:31,609
anyway what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see is that each the</font>

535
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:34,269
https certificate market is is

536
00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:37,369
bifurcating into two different

537
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:39,739
compartments basically there are secure

538
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:42,379
but expensive suits these are high-end

539
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:44,029
certs you know granted by by verisign

540
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:46,908
you may have heard the terminology

541
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:49,070
extended validation these are certs that

542
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:51,409
cost serious money and have manual

543
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,559
processes that that verify you are the

544
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:56,090
person requesting the cert the other end

545
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,309
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low end market that I'm</font>

546
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,260
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about low inserts are you know</font>

547
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,178
from people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> GoDaddy you know they</font>

548
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,919
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey you know give us give us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

549
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:05,779
bucks or 20 bucks and we'll give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

550
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,460
cert you know what we'll do basically is

551
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:09,049
will look and who is<font color="#E5E5E5"> will find out what</font>

552
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the DNA or what the email address</font>

553
00:21:09,049 --> 00:21:13,490
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this domain is well send</font>

554
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,520
in an email you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can send an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email back</font>

555
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:18,770
that's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough for us right so while</font>

556
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:22,010
these are super cheap they're also less

557
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:23,418
secure and so why do I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

558
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:25,549
perspectives might be good for this

559
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:27,710
market well compared to these low

560
00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:30,320
inserts I would argue that perspectives

561
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:33,080
actually offers comparable security now

562
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,178
why is that well if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about what</font>

563
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,340
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes for an attacker just to fool</font>

564
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:41,330
perspectives you need an attacker that

565
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:42,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">can basically block or basically take</font>

566
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,230
control of large number of paths in the

567
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet to Bob com or whatever</font>

568
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,309
destination you're talking about well an

569
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,500
attacker with equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> power could</font>

570
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:55,730
very likely spoof these verification

571
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,740
email sent by low<font color="#CCCCCC"> n CA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in fact well</font>

572
00:21:55,730 --> 00:22:00,559
with perspectives there's this notion of

573
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,539
temporal resistance which is that you

574
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,520
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to sustain your attack</font>

575
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:06,200
for a long time in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fool all the</font>

576
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">notaries there's no such requirement</font>

577
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:10,010
with a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these low inserts and</font>

578
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:13,070
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> email verifications I could just</font>

579
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:15,440
hijack something request a cert right

580
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,470
spoof<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email and then quit my hijack</font>

581
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,429
and I have a valid cert for that domain

582
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,440
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other reasons I think</font>

583
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:23,750
perspectives is actually attractive too

584
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,610
so it's if it's comparable security I

585
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:28,039
argue that it's much more convenient for

586
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,918
server admins to use remember that with

587
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:33,110
ssh style authentication the server

588
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,600
admin doesn't need to manually requester

589
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:38,570
install a certificate the server can

590
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,189
just auto generate a key and start using

591
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:43,370
that because the network notaries will

592
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:45,559
start probing also this is a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

593
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:48,289
detail but those of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that have ever</font>

594
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:50,299
tried to use SSL with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual hosting</font>

595
00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:52,129
solution that has shared IP it that

596
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:54,230
share multiple services on a single IP

597
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,850
address know that it doesn't work well

598
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,919
actually with perspectives this would

599
00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,500
work because perspectives treats all

600
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,630
self signed cert and any cert basically

601
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,640
just as a public key and so it could

602
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,770
bind the same public key to whatever

603
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,310
domain name you

604
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,600
even if you're sharing an IP address so

605
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,190
not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it more convenient for</font>

606
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,020
server admins but I argue there are

607
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:16,600
benefits to having a solution that's

608
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:19,629
based on freely available data first

609
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,370
because this data is generated is

610
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,350
generated by<font color="#E5E5E5"> these network notaries</font>

611
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,260
there's no transaction that ever happens

612
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:30,010
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> server's necessarily and the</font>

613
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:31,330
network notary and we argue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

614
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,560
there's no reason the server owners

615
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:34,960
would have to pay anything for this

616
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,850
service in fact it's so dirt cheap to

617
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,310
run these<font color="#CCCCCC"> navarette notaries that the</font>

618
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,929
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know i'm running a notary</font>

619
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,149
right now that probes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know maybe</font>

620
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:44,920
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10k</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different host names and it's</font>

621
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,240
not you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small fraction of a</font>

622
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,670
percent on a box that we're running

623
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now you know band with this cheap</font>

624
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:54,250
hardware is cheap and another advantage

625
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,870
of being based on freely available data

626
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,820
is that clients can actually make

627
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,919
individualized security trade-offs if

628
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,169
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what a see a sign cert</font>

629
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,840
right now says is you know if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

630
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:07,900
has a see a sign cert that means that

631
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,240
that that key is valid but what a client

632
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:12,130
can do with notary data is say actually

633
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I'm a little more worried about</font>

634
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:16,420
this website<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to be pickier about</font>

635
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:19,330
what keys I except for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> website</font>

636
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:21,100
right so if we if we think back to our

637
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:23,980
example they could apply a different

638
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:26,020
client policy right they could say I'm

639
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,380
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to demand very high consistency</font>

640
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,300
for my banking website but you know this

641
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,970
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> website I log into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from my school</font>

642
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">well you know I'm gonna ply a different</font>

643
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,320
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of policy there and that's</font>

644
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:40,540
something you can't do with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

645
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,250
current see a model because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

646
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:46,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">not flexible and it's not based on</font>

647
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:48,970
publicly available data so the third

648
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,130
possible use of perspectives is that it

649
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:55,270
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide an additional layer on top</font>

650
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:57,520
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing on route signed ssl</font>

651
00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:00,070
certificate model what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean by that</font>

652
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I don't know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

653
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,830
ever opened your browser and actually

654
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,600
looked at how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate</font>

655
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,370
authorities are trusted by it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

656
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,800
number is pretty high 30 plus is a

657
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,419
pretty conservative estimate I can't

658
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,350
count much higher than<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know</font>

659
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:15,140
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just quit it 30</font>

660
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:17,418
but the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if any of these</font>

661
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,860
certificate authorities are tricked into

662
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:24,860
granting a tricked into granting a valid

663
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:26,659
certificate basically everyone you know

664
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,389
that they could fool any client and

665
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,220
heaven forbid that there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

666
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:34,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root key would be exposed in which</font>

667
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:36,740
case someone can spoof any website well

668
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,990
how might perspectives on be able to

669
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">help with this or remember perspectives</font>

670
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:45,919
uses the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current state of</font>

671
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:49,039
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network to bind to bind on public</font>

672
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,840
keys to DNS addresses and so even if

673
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone presents you with a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route signed</font>

674
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,418
certificate to you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calm and</font>

675
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:58,909
you query the notary's you could see

676
00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:00,919
from the notary data that Bank calm was

677
00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:03,890
not was not seen using that certificate

678
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:06,380
from any of the notary's and thus you

679
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:09,740
can detect this inconsistency and reject

680
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:13,309
the key even if it was actually signed

681
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,020
by a trusted CA there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of</font>

682
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:18,070
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting possibilities I think</font>

683
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:21,350
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically have to do with using the</font>

684
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,809
excuse me the notary data the data

685
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">collected by notaries to proactively</font>

686
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:30,200
detect attacks for example imagine that

687
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:32,330
the bank you know or a bank or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob palm</font>

688
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,270
for example could actually monitor the

689
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,399
notary's himself and say hey why is this

690
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,110
different key suddenly popping up maybe

691
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,409
I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> look into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe I should</font>

692
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:43,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">report an attack to that isp right so I</font>

693
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:45,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">think there are a bunch of different</font>

694
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:48,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting ways we can also use this</font>

695
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,679
probing data to detect attacks even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

696
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:53,950
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the primary primary data that</font>

697
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,750
is being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authenticate the key</font>

698
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I just do a lot of information</font>

699
00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:00,620
at you so I'm about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap up but I</font>

700
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,450
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a pitch for the currently</font>

701
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,729
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network notary deployment that</font>

702
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:05,929
we're that we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now basically</font>

703
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:08,090
there's something called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong test</font>

704
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:10,669
bed which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an academic test bed and we</font>

705
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,770
have four or five<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network notaries</font>

706
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:15,830
running on it and how it basically works

707
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:17,809
is if if you contact the network

708
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,970
notaries and they've never heard of the

709
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:21,340
service you contacted the

710
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,990
about they will probe on demand and give

711
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:27,549
you results and they'll keep probing

712
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:29,260
that service so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have three types of</font>

00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,059
modified version of openssh will contact

725
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,740
the notary's and present you with the

726
00:27:55,059 --> 00:27:59,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">node rate data this lets you make a</font>

727
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:02,890
better security decision we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

728
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:05,830
the firefox 3 extension that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned</font>

729
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,900
earlier that in this case if it ever

730
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:11,020
gets a self-signed certificate that it

731
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,360
can't validate what it does is it

732
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,860
contacts the notary looks at the results

733
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then based on your personal settings</font>

734
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:20,199
whether you chose high availability or

735
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:23,230
high security it may choose to override

736
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the UM the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> security air of course you</font>

737
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,780
can also configure it to not

738
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:27,760
automatically<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide the security</font>

739
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:30,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">error if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to play with it</font>

740
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,200
and see how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finally if</font>

741
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:35,590
you're allergic to installing software

742
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,049
written by me you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just use the web</font>

743
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,918
to query this on our main website we

744
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:44,679
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know simple PHP page</font>

745
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:47,020
that you can use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter in a dns name</font>

746
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:50,830
a port<font color="#E5E5E5"> a protocol and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see the</font>

747
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:52,570
notary results for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> site so if</font>

748
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:54,490
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in maybe running a</font>

749
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:55,928
network notary server here are some very

750
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,230
quick stats that you should know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

751
00:28:55,929 --> 00:29:02,110
well running running the notary code on

752
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,630
a modern server and it is a fork or two

753
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:07,449
gig machine with tons of<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM basically</font>

754
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that machine can do almost 17 million</font>

755
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:14,200
unique probes per day<font color="#E5E5E5"> or it can handle</font>

756
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,000
25k notary queries per second so<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

757
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty big numbers so we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

758
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,890
reasonable deployment you could just

759
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:23,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a single server running doing both</font>

760
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:24,549
the probing and that the query handling

761
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,230
which is actually what we do right now

762
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:27,490
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of using that old</font>

763
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:29,170
workstation you

764
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,000
sitting under your desk here are some

765
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,490
other numbers you know the probe numbers

766
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,260
are lower but still 2 million probe

767
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,670
today is you know non-trivial there

768
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:39,280
aren't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> that many websites that are</font>

769
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:41,230
running HTTPS so I mean there are more

770
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">than two million but you know that it's</font>

771
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:45,130
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right range and the queries per</font>

772
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:48,429
second is actually comparable to the

773
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,309
modern server so the good news is this

774
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:53,559
code is highly unwise that that's you

775
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:55,120
know that's code for its research code

776
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:57,220
and we got it working but I didn't

777
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,379
optimize it so i actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's</font>

778
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,540
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> room for about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know three</font>

779
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:05,350
or four x improvement in the probing

780
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:07,330
numbers so um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also as we look toward</font>

781
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,949
the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we're going to scale</font>

782
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:10,419
very well with hardware trends because

783
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,670
if you think about these operations

784
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:14,770
they're all tribute parallelizable that

785
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,870
is the more cores you have you know you

786
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,400
you get that that much of an increase

787
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,959
that's one of the reasons why you see

788
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,679
such a jump with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> modern server</font>

789
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,780
versus the old single core workstation

790
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,940
so with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should note that all of</font>

791
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,678
this code is of course open source we

792
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:31,900
have source and binary is available on

793
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,090
the website as long as well as the web

794
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,309
demo here's a link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the paper if you</font>

795
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any you know feedback or flames or</font>

796
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:40,240
you're interested in helping out there's

797
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,420
my email and with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will take any</font>

798
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,420
questions

799
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,740
Justin

800
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,110
I didn't know there's anyone left in

801
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:55,419
here after i did so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Warren Kamari Google</font>

802
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:57,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">uh-huh is there a way for Bob trolls</font>

803
00:30:55,419 --> 00:30:59,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Gilver out ripping the 10 role that</font>

804
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,110
that's a great question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact in</font>

805
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:03,940
the current in the paper we don't

806
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,178
mention anything but we've actually have

807
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:09,130
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about how how you would</font>

808
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:10,809
work then in the design and the

809
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:12,730
unfortunate things we think it actually

810
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:15,309
would require changes to the server and

811
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,230
basically letting the server kind of put

812
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:19,899
two keys out there at the same time and

813
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,029
letting one build up a history<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

814
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:23,949
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then once that history is built up</font>

815
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:25,269
sufficiently you can then start using

816
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:29,919
the second key that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

817
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:32,220
question any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions hi thank</font>

818
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,220
you very much
