00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:00,150
Craig Daniel and Scott so as the title

13
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:03,940
suggests this is yet another ipv6 talk

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:08,020
sure you're thrilled we however looked

15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,270
at traffic data and I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,690
people up until this point have had only

17
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:20,050
indirect estimates of the amount of ipv6

18
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:23,440
traffic on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so I hope first</font>

19
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:26,050
to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk into a bigger context</font>

20
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,450
from arbors perspective a bigger and

21
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,420
bigger measurement to push that that

22
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,550
Arbor is going through right now then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

23
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">will talk about why you might care I'll</font>

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:38,920
repeat why you might care about an ipv6

25
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:42,670
measurement talk introduce our

26
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:45,940
methodology the key results and then to

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,570
preempt some possible objections we got

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:51,460
some feedback mostly very positive but

29
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:55,298
some some complaints with the

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:57,309
methodology so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go over some</font>

31
00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,070
potential weaknesses with a methodology

32
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:01,869
so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> itching when I present the</font>

33
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:05,380
methodology to complain you of course

34
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:10,360
welcome to scream at me but I might

35
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:13,900
cover it later so like I said what we

36
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,810
wanted to do is provide a global and

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,060
longitudal perspective on the amount of

38
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,209
ipv6 traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we observed in the</font>

39
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,120
implement and this really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of a</font>

40
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,620
bigger push at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arbor to leverage their</font>

41
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,570
deployments that the probes that they

42
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:30,640
have in the field to provide a

43
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:35,320
perspective on on all of internet

44
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,450
traffic sort of on the one hand any kind

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,850
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic where is it going what</font>

46
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,640
services applications

47
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:43,850
and what's the the rate of growth and on

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,899
the other hand the pervasiveness of

49
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:49,890
certain specific types of unwanted

50
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,900
traffic such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS attacks so they</font>

51
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,769
want to leverage their I guess

52
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,750
approaching<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3000 deployments now and</font>

53
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,140
have networks participate in this

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:09,480
voluntarily to share anonymize data with

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:11,519

have in this little diagram toy diagram

three networks that I've bought Arbor

60
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,240
gear perhaps peak flow or something and

61
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,869
they send data then back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:31,410
mothership for Arbor to analyze perhaps

63
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,750
in an offline setting such as this or in

64
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,240
real time these networks categorize

65
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:41,360
themselves according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their type and</font>

their predominant geographic coverage

67

the data set what we get is traffic in

and going to from the the given networks

72
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:08,990

to impress you it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little old I guess</font>

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level message is that we have</font>

repeating why my people care about the

ipv6 well we're running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of addresses</font>

96
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,490
internet will implode or explode there's

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone certainty about but I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

98

within the next few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 months was</font>

the order of 28 orders of magnitude more

102
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,150
addresses so that should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be sufficient</font>

103
00:05:36,389 --> 00:05:41,100
for a couple years and because we have

<font color="#E5E5E5">this big problem and there is an</font>

we have this this this problem the

to to make the transition how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

116
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,380
going for you all and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideally what we</font>

117
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,330
want the direct measure is an

understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of ipv6</font>

traffic that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the Internet</font>

120
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:29,760
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> as people have mentioned</font>

121
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,490
today and I can certainly test you as an

122
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,889
academic it's really hard to get network

123
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:37,830
operators to just share you share all

124
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:42,210
their traffic data with you for various

125
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:44,580
largely understandable reasons therefore

126
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,830
we have primarily indirect estimates of

127
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,050
how much ipv6 traffic there is on

128
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,400
internet so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the related</font>

129
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:56,300
work and was talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier three</font>

130
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,888
percent is the fraction of a SNS with

<font color="#CCCCCC">ip6 bgp announcements that's</font>

132
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,889
you know a fairly small<font color="#E5E5E5"> number but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

133
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:08,318
larger than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1% which is the fraction of</font>

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:11,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet to sites with a passing ipv6</font>

135
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,909
grade a little disappointing one might

136
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:15,819
expect them to be ahead of the curve or

137
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:17,998
maybe they are even more disappointing

138
00:07:15,819 --> 00:07:20,889
is that 0.4% of the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> web sites</font>

139
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:23,169
according to some methodology are using

140
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:24,939
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally as you may predict</font>

141
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:28,900
there's an even lower number which is

142
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:31,960
0.2 percent which is the ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

143
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:34,299
queries as a fraction of the ipv4 DNS

144
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,729
load so we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small numbers</font>

145
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,319
here you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an order of</font>

146
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:41,680
magnitude difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a smallest</font>

147
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,240
and the largest but they're all small so

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,930
our contribution is to provide another

149
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,629
number to this but one that is that

150
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:54,279
directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> States from our five terabytes</font>

151

156
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:17,740
now I've told you the the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

157
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:22,750
and the broad methodology so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

158
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:26,020
more specifically what is ipv6 internet

159
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,879
traffic in our case while I told you

160
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,729
what traffic is that's largely from

161
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,949
flow-based measurements by internet we

162
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:35,110
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter domain so this is traffic in</font>

164
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:46,170

165
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:49,810

168
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,540
monitor it the router has to have a net

flow v9 the we have of the two forms of

170
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:07,300
tunneled we have ipv4 protocol 41 tunnel

171
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:11,609
traffic and then 30 traffic which is

172
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,609
tunneled over UDP port 35 44

173

here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another graph primarily meant to</font>

good news 150 megabits you know can

much but I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this we</font>

that our report had an immediate

up the good news I guess so potential

240
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:40,279
objections to the methodology so the one

241
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:43,128
that we heard a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:48,199
guess the corporate perspective there is

boxes and include you in the the

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,619
measurement study the slightly more

248
00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:00,019
scientific response is that at five

249
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:01,730
terabytes per second it's certainly the

250
00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:04,939
largest study today that I'm aware of

251
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:09,709

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,300
more ipv6 intro domain and

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:38,269
something we have access to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

for for the for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks in question</font>

264
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:46,259
so we hope to look at that in future

265
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:50,790
work and also for future work again this

266
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:54,329
data set is flow based primarily we

267
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:58,469
should we also hope to do a measurement

268
00:13:54,329 --> 00:14:02,748
study based on dpi data perhaps ipv6

269
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:08,309
ipv6 traffic is hiding in other ports

270
00:14:02,749 --> 00:14:09,779
then final slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the objections it's</font>

271
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:12,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> under counting native</font>

272
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:15,720
ipv6 traffic like I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to</font>

273
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:19,860
measure it monitor it the router needs

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:24,899
to have v9 and it seems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> b5 is the</font>

the flavor<font color="#E5E5E5"> of choice on the one hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

276
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:27,929
know I can punt on this and say hey you

00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:30,089
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not my fault the route of</font>

278
00:14:27,929 --> 00:14:32,999
the the network operators need to make

279
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,980
this transition the other point is that

280
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:37,170
you know someone somewhere made the

281
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,240
determination that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't necessary</font>

00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:41,819
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this upgrade to perform this</font>

283
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:44,759
monitoring and so one can read things

284
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:48,029
into that it's also possible that we're

285
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">under counting teredo traffic because my</font>

we're under counting it we're probably

297
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:21,899
not under counting it by much and as you

negative news I suppose my talk is

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:06,259
mainly a measurement talk deliberately

311
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:07,639
dry and boring but perhaps and other

315
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:20,660
from a lot of networks perspective

316
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,389
transitioning to ipv6 represents

317
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,339
probably a net outflux of money at least

318
00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:26,749
for now there's there's a cost

and transition upgrades but not clear

00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:34,670
that there's any added revenue it's also

perspective right now ipv4 is working

00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:06,319
well why should I mess with with my

Google has ipv6 google.com which works

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:50,720
very well but my understanding is that

345
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,300
if a number of websites if they were to

346
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:58,070
put a quad a record for for example

347

have ipv6 connectivity would break and

350
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:12,140
so the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font>

352
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:19,250
be a major stumbling block for getting

00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,770
ipv6 content out there it has to be made

354
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:25,090
somehow transparent to the users so that

355
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:28,370
they essentially go to the same site and

356
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:30,770
and that and it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> works so i think</font>

357
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:33,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the customer space needs to have</font>

358

some major upgrades so that if they get

00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:51,950
it's probably one of several major

366
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,320

367
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:10,290
UDP port number yes so what you're doing

368
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,659
is you're counting is signaling traffic

369
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,240
to read oh you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not counting with</font>

370
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:18,270
data traffic right so the data traffic

371
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,670
is civil order of magnitude larger and

372
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:22,670
the signal in traffic so what you are

373
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">measuring these actually irrelevant</font>

374
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:28,620
terrible right so actually where the

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,380

<font color="#E5E5E5">since they only offer it over the m6</font>

431
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,999
that's the only place you can get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

432
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,609
if you turn that news period often talks

433
00:22:06,999 --> 00:22:11,859
by at least two orders of magnitude so

434
00:22:09,609 --> 00:22:12,728
the m6 thing is a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> off that</font>

435
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:13,960
doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not more</font>

436
00:22:12,729 --> 00:22:16,629
traffic in general i'm just saying that

437
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,909
access is a bad data point to say that

438
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:25,059
this data set presented in the slides is

439
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:28,749
wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thank You Randy bush ioj were</font>

440
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:37,840
arguing over how powerful microscope you

need to see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the microscopes of</font>

the bat broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do an enema driven it</font>

443
00:22:41,169 --> 00:22:49,330
sucks when some serious computer

444
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:52,779
scientists are measuring your product

445
00:22:49,330 --> 00:23:00,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a behavioral phenomena you will in</font>

446
00:22:52,779 --> 00:23:00,090
trouble and it's a tournament

447
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,720
Jeff Houston I must admit this whole

448
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,550
issue of exactly what you're measuring

449
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,430
what does it mean really becomes a

450
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:15,230
problem i looked at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

451
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:16,430
traffic and the problem with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

452
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,190
the traffic we actually see on the

453
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:22,160
network is heavy tail distribution then

454
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,410
there's an astonishing amount of large

455
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,960
traffic flows where the volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> is high</font>

456
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,700
but the number is low an awful lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">photo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that very short traffic flow is</font>

458
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,860
where the volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> is extremely low over</font>

459
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:36,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the flow right so what do you mean when</font>

460
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:38,689
you say I want to traffic versus what

461
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:41,530
does it mean to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that industry is</font>

462
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:43,610
making it steps towards migration and

463
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:46,010
part of the reason I suppose why I

464
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:48,889
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what was happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a web</font>

465

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look really hard about the narrow</font>

468
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,310
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was measuring when I was getting</font>

my microscope out right<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

470
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:02,240
packets it just didn't seem to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make much</font>

471
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,130
sense in terms of what's the real

472
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,170
question I'm trying to answer so

473
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,970
absolutely and I mean I didn't mean if

474
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:10,760
if it was I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it all to say</font>

475
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:14,270
that the related work was was not very

476
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,850
useful and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think each</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the each</font>

477
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:20,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the different metrics that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose</font>

478
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:23,830
to measure what will have weaknesses and

479
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:27,950
you know are useful for some things

480
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:31,189
normally just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrap this you looted</font>

481
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,470
five months what time you look to five

<font color="#E5E5E5">months years of 10 min throughs it's</font>

483
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:39,029
it's it's a year so what was it like

484
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,799
or the year before the year after some

485
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:43,109
ways when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually don't know what</font>

486
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:45,779
you're measuring reality as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

487
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:47,399
keep on<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it the comparison</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

488

what happened before or what happens in

00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:51,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">the future then becomes interesting it's</font>

the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> order differential that then</font>

491
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:56,879
becomes you know the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentary or</font>

after that seems amazing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> e-flat but</font>

493
00:24:56,879 --> 00:25:02,879
that's an amazingly short sample a year

494
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:07,889
in this kind of world is it we move very

495
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:10,559
slowly<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone please these are</font>

496
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:12,748
forensics I just want to travel to the

497
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:16,019
previous discussion that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine</font>

498
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:19,859
native ipv6 traffic based on escalator

499
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:21,929
we have and it was true indeed that it

500
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:26,580
was in beginning caused by basically one

501
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:28,859
provider who enabled new services over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

502
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,649
and that is not true anymore at least

503
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:36,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">from what I can see in the growth that</font>

504
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:40,139
happened I mean we do about 6 800 max

505
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:43,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">ugly and 200 of them more this first</font>

506
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,609
provider who enabled would happen

507
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:52,968
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thats</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all our questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank</font>

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> randy talk is cheap how many</font>

providers here grandpa hydroxide how

511
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:13,089
many providers here have public smtp

512
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:19,249
servers that are accessible over ipv6

513
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:21,229
web servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns servers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay could some</font>

514
00:26:19,249 --> 00:26:23,899
researcher actually take this

515
00:26:21,229 --> 00:26:25,279
measurement up by raised hands by

516
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:27,049
actually doing something like that

517
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,809
Medina<font color="#CCCCCC"> godless going they selected out</font>

518
00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:33,440
there and find out through all this BS

519
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:36,019
far we as a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually deploying</font>

than eggs you know

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:59,440
okay thank you thank you well right

523
00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,960
we're ahead so with one more question

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hair and add on make it</font>

really clear chairman<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Aaron oh we</font>

526
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:12,559
don't have to deploy ipv6 if you don't

527
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,720
need more dresses when the central<font color="#CCCCCC"> ours</font>

528
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,570
run out when they settle red bull runs

out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the IRS run out there may</font>

be some reclaimed you're all going to

531
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,929
mine your own infrastructure you may go

back to customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say hey I really</font>

you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need an employee six unless</font>

537
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,470
you're relying on the fact that you

538
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:38,540
continually do new addresses to connect

539
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,980
new customers that doesn't apply to

540
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:41,690
everyone in the room but it does apply

541
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:50,150
to some folks and they were aggressively
