00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:11,820
so Alex could not make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it he had some</font>

2
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,190
last-minute commitments in New York he

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:25,590
wishes he could be here so I'll do the

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:27,990
talking instead so I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the</font>

5
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,198
the title<font color="#CCCCCC"> is perhaps a bit deceptive in</font>

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,500
itself the it is there's nothing being

7
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,570
stolen more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than any other location that</font>

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,059
would experience a<font color="#E5E5E5"> subtle effects hi</font>

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,030
jack has anything stolen the interesting

10
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,040
stuff here is uh it's going to be

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,660
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interception so if i</font>

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,219
could have retitled the slide and got it

13
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the presenter laptop in time you</font>

14
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,969

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,680
different so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go few few</font>

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,719
everyone understands basic stuff about

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the details of that we're</font>

who have talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a lot of</font>

26
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,350
theory that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been spun and then</font>

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,930
talked a little bit about the actual

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,908
application mechanics of this particular

29
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:29,310
operation and then talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of</font>

30
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,810
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do to stop it perhaps ask</font>

31
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,329
for more support from the community to

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,490
continue to push the further development

33
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,220
and then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an analysis of</font>

34
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:40,280
what we did at<font color="#E5E5E5"> DEFCON I think that's</font>

35
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:44,340
probably the more interesting piece that

36
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:48,000
folks have requested in this talk so

37
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:50,040
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you hadn't heard yet this</font>

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,409
is a perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger deal than other</font>

39
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,930
types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff we fix hijacks in the</font>

40
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,880
sense that in essentially essentially in

41
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,909
a blind scenario with no coordination

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,798
and either the attackers network

43
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:04,920
necessarily or definitely be tackies

44
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,470
network you can attract traffic and

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,680
bring it right back to that Network

46
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,930
that's that that in itself is not

47
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">terribly novel but in the mechanism will</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to our knowledge of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar form the</font>

50
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,660
other important point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that to solve</font>

51
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,350
these issues requires direct attention

52
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,090
any providers who are doing adequate

53
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,640
filtering now you're not interesting to

54

this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who are not in the</font>

in if you will so prior work important

60
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:53,510
to cover so the missus report from last

61
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:56,060
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year essentially just states quite</font>

62
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,980
generically yes it can be done we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

63
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,180
intercept traffic somehow no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

64
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:05,359
say how the most recent discovery i had

65
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,660
made was of a particular paper from paul

66
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,730
francis at<font color="#E5E5E5"> cornell and he was using</font>

67
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:13,160
mechanism that essentially pretended to

68
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:15,950
be or would have rather been appropriate

69
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:18,320
to do at a tear to type network somebody

70
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,179
with several hundred edges and his paper

71
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,730
essentially says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you swim</font>

72
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,220
through a s path alone and do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

73
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,840
ugly flicks hijacking what is you know

74
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,200
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually do that successfully</font>

75
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,850
and then also how much edge capacity

76
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,518
which you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> or rather how many edges</font>

77
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be required to net significant</font>

78
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:40,760
amounts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic so interesting</font>

79
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:43,250
approach but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessary like this the</font>

80
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:47,060
next most near match to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of a</font>

81
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:50,090
topic was one from UIUC and this one was

82
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,070
discussing essentially by positioning

83
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:54,230
oneself or finding a network that is

84
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,799
ideally positioned what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done</font>

85
00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:00,380
using essentially traffic engineering

86
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:03,890
techniques to both intercept the traffic

87
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:07,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">and can be re deliberate to the intended</font>

88
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:09,829
destination so interestingly none of

89
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,600
these discussed creation of a path what

90
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,319
I what we will call in this presentation

91
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:18,639
to be a feasible path

92
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:20,769
back to the target again we're not

93
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,080
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to I</font>

94
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,479
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to discuss the particulars I</font>

95
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,820
mean getting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> route out there is this</font>

96
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:30,250
plan is simple I are our updates aren't

97
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,380
secured there's a lack of trust from the

98
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,320
top down we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all know that the</font>

99
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,419
interesting stuff here is that we can

100
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,820
create these selective black holes

101
00:04:37,419 --> 00:04:42,669
through typical techniques we've already

102
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,229
been aware of and<font color="#CCCCCC"> facilitates</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting interception potential and</font>

104
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:50,440
at a large scale and from essentially

105
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,000
any location to any location the other

106
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,740
parts will discuss any other thing

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,979
that's perhaps half novel partially

108
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,350
novel about this is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> by applying TTL</font>

effectively invisible two points that

113
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:12,639
are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probe perhaps twice round</font>

114

and tools like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as far as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hiding the</font>

122
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">we knew of the dozen or handful sites</font>

123
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,760
that we're monitoring and setting alarms

124
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,500
that perhaps would be forwarded through

125
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,620
this technique by including them in the

126
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:48,250
path we'll talk a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

127
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that might be applicable so what is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

128
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:53,229
concept at large what is really

129
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,230
happening so to successfully intercept

130
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,150
data you have to both bring it in and

131
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,850
then again pass it back somewhere and

132
00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:03,659
the interest here is in getting it back

133
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,640
and then not breaking things so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

134
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,040
to create this path the question is how

135
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,719
and the papers discuss prior had

136
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,900
techniques for this and some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

137
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">were shall we say a non-trivial there</font>

138
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:18,020
was work required or coordination

139
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:21,060
required this one doesn't require that

140
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,469
so how do you create this path back well

141
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,420
first to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the path from you</font>

142
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:25,980
the in-place sporting path from your

143
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:29,070
network in the attackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> vantage point</font>

144
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,080
towards a particular target is do you

145
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,690
forward through any particular up

146
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,880
strings if so of course you do if so

147
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:38,070

and I think ultimately this means we

290
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:15,339
need to step it up we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this</font>

291
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:17,709
in 10 years I don't want to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here</font>

292
00:13:15,339 --> 00:13:20,639
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next time and still see similar</font>

293
00:13:17,709 --> 00:13:23,229
issues I'd like to have this fall I

294
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,449
guess of course we heard a discussion

295
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,579
about securing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root fryer and I'd</font>

00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:29,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something similar more</font>

297
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:35,498
about securing things from the point of

00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:37,420
view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our IRS so perhaps the half</font>

300
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,399
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that we did this at</font>

301
00:13:39,579 --> 00:13:43,719
Def Con was was of course to attract<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

302
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,889
traffic but that wasn't cool enough

303
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,049
because it reveals a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> trace route</font>

304
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:52,029
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing anything about it so</font>

306
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:59,460
this last 24 and from the point of view

307
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:03,640
of a router in on a Chicago Transit wing

308
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:05,710
TT was taking a detour of course in two

to TTL upon ingress you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

314
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,130
effectively hide all that and this is a

<font color="#E5E5E5">trivial thing with my P tables it's an</font>

318
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:34,720
so with an adjustment the hijacked route

00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,970
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirteen hops you could have made</font>

329
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,939
this isn't obvious you'd have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

330
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,100
view somewhere ideally someone looking

at things to secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> things would do more</font>

332
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,970
than just look for sub prefix hijacks or

sub<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fix origin changes but also</font>

334
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:12,250
something that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at perhaps a</font>

335
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:14,529
tomography or a topology approach to

336
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:16,480
painting down the intersection of does

337
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:20,230
that edge that we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> or we list it</font>

338
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:24,850
really exists in routing to be open to a

339
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:27,550
lot of interesting perhaps research so

340
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:31,000
the default way to origin it<font color="#E5E5E5"> originated</font>

341
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:33,849
a prefix of course would reveal your or

<font color="#CCCCCC">w/e attackers origin is in the path a</font>

343
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:38,470
friend had turned me on to the point

344
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:41,020
that devices that support transparent a

345
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,830
s or other software damon's such as open

346
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:47,529
bgp d Khawaja can send rounds with any

347
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:50,800
apparent origin is and if your neighbors

348
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:53,709
not enforcing next day s on the neighbor

349
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,400
session no except this prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> no except</font>

350
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:59,410
this advertisement without<font color="#CCCCCC"> any troubles</font>

351
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,260
so perhaps the attacker could even be

352
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,750
completely

353
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,300
opaque in the origin of this sub prefix

354
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:09,720
if you have perhaps a session to your

355
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,880
transit configured as reflector client

356
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,430
or route server client as you went at

357
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,580
say and then PLA style<font color="#CCCCCC"> browse server</font>

358
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:21,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">based exchange so this opens up yet one</font>

359
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:25,170
more Avenue for being somewhat somewhat

360
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,770
stealth again this just will not make

361
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:31,170
any sense from what a real relationship

362
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:34,740
reveal if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could examine the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

363
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:36,089
data point at each particular at JCC and

364
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:42,270
again this could be an avenue<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

365
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:43,920
detection as well so shorter talk then

366
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,310
perhaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> the implant think we have time</font>

367
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">for some questions certainly but I guess</font>

368
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:51,959
all I want to summarize by saying was

369
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:54,180
that this is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> self can be nearly</font>

370
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,500
invisible yet you'll still see some

371
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,660
disturbances from the point of view of a

372
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,240
sub prefix hijack if we consider some of

373
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the papers especially the one from</font>

374

<font color="#E5E5E5">Cornell we know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even need</font>

375

to win the sub prefixes if a certain

376
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,260
Network were co-opted this could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">without suffix I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Jax required suffix</font>

378
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:13,440
wouldn't even matter we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just win</font>

379
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:15,270
through edges if you won the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right edges</font>

380
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,339
for whatever the purpose was then the

381
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:22,199
need is served we know that again path

382
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,329
isn't going to be the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> telltale but</font>

383
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,430
it could be massaged so we can't depend

384
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">on that alone to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perhaps detective so</font>

385
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,930
for I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this points to a combination</font>

386
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,020
of mechanisms required to adequate
