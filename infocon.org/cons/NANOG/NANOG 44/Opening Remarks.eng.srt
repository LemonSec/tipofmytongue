00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:10,260
a year ago when I was tapped on the

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,679
shoulder and<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for the possibility</font>

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,680

I promise not to get too emotional but

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,460
Rodney Jaffe has a very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> long rich</font>

18
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:05,119
shied away from the challenge and the

00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,510
extra resources that it took to<font color="#CCCCCC"> put</font>

104
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,080
the shirt so you all have gotten your

105
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,140
shirt and it's got a character<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jon</font>

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,969
postel on it and a bunch of airplanes

107
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,510
which you may wonder<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the heck is</font>

108
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:28,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and the poss tell law be</font>

109
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:30,979
conservative and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've sent and</font>

110
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,669
liberal and what you receive on the

111
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:37,909
airplanes are in memory of John's love

112
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:41,120
of paper airplanes and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> simplicity of</font>

113
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:43,610
which they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and at his memorial ten</font>

114
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,849
years ago they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> took page</font>

115
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,340
so the RFC's folded them and flew them

116
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,680
out so there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something along</font>

117
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,609
those lines I<font color="#CCCCCC"> won't say specifically</font>

118
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,870
what on Wednesday if you're here so you

119
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">have something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look forward to</font>

120
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,500
something new on that the character

121
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:06,409
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> was loaned to us from the group</font>

122
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:08,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">that does the I can wiki so we were very</font>

123
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:11,300
happy that they allowed us to do that

124
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:14,330
and interestingly enough my son who is

125
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,250
not a geek told me that he hears about

126
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,580
the poss tells law and the internet

127
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,800
gaming community so its far-reaching

128
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:26,060
many people know it in many<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

129
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:30,669
contexts so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought it was</font>

130
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:33,139
appropriate to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the shirt so</font>

131
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:36,020
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to go into these links</font>

132
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:37,969
here but the cop this has hyperlinks if

that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I don't think the best of</font>

322
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,879
we could do that again which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably</font>

323
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:23,129
what we'll do or you guys could actually

324
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,300
just vote and pick the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted</font>

325
00:15:23,129 --> 00:15:26,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be on the steering committee that's</font>

326
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,430

you and finally just a couple schedule

346
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,209
changes the the hoped-for mystery

00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:13,709
presentation will not be later this

348
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:15,839
morning so there'll be some schedule

349
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:17,339
shuffles in the meantime which mostly

350
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,410
means you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little bit longer</font>

351
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,389
version of some other content and the

352
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,800
last point is if you received mail from

353
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:24,540
me saying your lightning talk was

354
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,519

356
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can get them loaded onto the</font>

357
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:31,319
speaker's laptop for later today if you

358
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,389
submitted a lightning talk and you did

359
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:35,819
not receive mail for me that doesn't

360
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean that your talk was not accepted it</font>

361
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:38,640
just means it wasn't accepted yet

362
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,770
it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean it won't be accepted</font>

363
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,810
eventually but we haven't rejected it

364
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:44,400
yet that's my point we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

365
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:49,739

373
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,120
appropriate for a 10-minute presentation

374
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,520
but not for a half an hour presentation

375
