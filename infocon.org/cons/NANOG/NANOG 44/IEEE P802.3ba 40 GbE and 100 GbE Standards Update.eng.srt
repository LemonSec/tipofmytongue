1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:09,389
heated heated discussion around some of

2
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:12,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">the 40 gig and Hunter gig</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> single mode</font>

3
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:15,030
objectives especially on the between the

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">two optics vendors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Finisar and op neck</font>

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,060
so that was fun to watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> we called it</font>

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,680
the Chris and Matt show which was kind

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,470
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> on going offline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and during the</font>

8
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,420
meetings draft one not zero is finished

9
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,880
I have another slide on that one because

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,769
it's such a significant thing that's

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,879
happened and basically the bottom line

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:37,649
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were on schedule for 2010 now an</font>

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,000
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is that there's</font>

14
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:40,920
already demand for things that are

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">outside the official project so that's</font>

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,730
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's okay for things to</font>

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:47,849
happen outside the I Triple E or to

18
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,919
happen later like for tenure<font color="#CCCCCC"> net10 gbase</font>

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">t happened you know five years out to</font>

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,930
the standard or so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thing is</font>

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,000
that the architecture is really flexible

22
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,129
so it allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lot of extensions and</font>

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,399
there are things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in</font>

24
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,378
there for future technology so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,689
expect a lot of MSA as<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSAs or</font>

26
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:08,189
multi-source agreements we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

27
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,639
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people get together and do</font>

28
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,139
something and again that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for it</font>

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,880
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside the I Triple E the I</font>

30
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,470
Triple E is really responsible for

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,320
defining a standard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the architecture</font>

32
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,830
and less responsible for specific

33
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,720
implementation decisions so draft one

34
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:27,298
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is here everyone's pretty</font>

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,158
excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a really really</font>

36
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,049
significant milestone because it

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,290
captures all the technical objectives

38
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,460
now I was going<font color="#CCCCCC"> over my slides with some</font>

39
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,409
of our standards guys and they were

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,079
chastising it for me for<font color="#E5E5E5"> not having read</font>

41
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:42,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire document and it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font>

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">202 292 pages long and they're like well</font>

43
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,380
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the question that you just</font>

44
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,939
asked is answered on page 75<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clause</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 or</font>

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,908
something but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I haven't</font>

46
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:55,169
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so apparently it is long and</font>

47
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:57,570
very detailed so draft two will be

48
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,299
technically complete and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

49
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,419
kind of talk about you know where we're

50
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,070
going and people ask me all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time</font>

51
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,110
ready and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we're going to see</font>

52
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,348
product so I just kind of want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

53
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,818
don't want to sound you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know basically</font>

54
00:02:09,348 --> 00:02:12,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know we're not quite there yet I</font>

55
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:14,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want to sound negative but I just</font>

56
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to you know caution people that</font>

57
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,430
there is some hype around 100 gig and 40

58
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,709
gig and that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still a lot of</font>

59
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,780
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could change so basically one</font>

60
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,610
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero is captures all the objectives</font>

61
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,440
but when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something on paper</font>

62
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,000
then you go and actually try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> build</font>

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,970
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> there stuff that's going to come up</font>

64
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,340
and the I Triple E calls this crossing

65
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,230
the eyes and diving the<font color="#E5E5E5"> t's see they do</font>

66
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,819
have a sense of humor and then there's

67
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:40,040
there's always a careful balance between

68
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:42,109
you know Margot timing and the standards

69
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,269
process and compliance so there's three

70
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,760
drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir that come out one does 0 to 0</font>

71
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:48,200
and 3 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> and each one will be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

72
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">more of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a standards so as time</font>

73
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,488
progresses there's more of a certainty

74
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,559
of being standards compliant if you base

75
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:56,510
your implementation on giraffe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vs</font>

76
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,510
draft one or graph<font color="#E5E5E5"> three versus rep to</font>

77
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:01,700
or something like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can</font>

78
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,018
actually start to evaluate you know what

79
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,780
it's going to take how they're going to

80
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:08,239
do it and start at least scoping out the

81
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,670
implementation based on draft one so

82
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the good news here's a summary</font>

83
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,649
of the reach objectives and

84
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:18,290
specifications this is a old slide the

85
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,230
difference is that the solution has now

86
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,970
been defined so for example we're still

87
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to figure out is 100 get going to</font>

88
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,680
be you know a ten-by-ten solution or 4i

89
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,049
25 all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things have been worked out</font>

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,510
and then again here you see all the

91
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,970
nomenclature for TG based key are for

92
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

93
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:40,130
helps you decide for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of</font>

94
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,690
stuff here's a very extremely

95
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:44,209
complicated slide and I apologize that

96
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,500
it's so dense but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font>

97
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,230
everything I want two slides that it

98
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,450
makes sense at least here's no review of

99
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,340
the architecture basically all the stuff

100
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,709
above the mac is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

101
00:03:52,340 --> 00:04:00,319
stuff below the mac changes so same

102
00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:02,930
frame format you know same same control

103
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,940
and all that kind of stuff another thing

104
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">has changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's new interface</font>

105
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:09,410
definitions below the mac and then of

106
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,580
course higher rates so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

107
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,960
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is in these</font>

108
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,090
blue circles which you probably can't

109
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,340
see unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the presentation in</font>

110
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:19,340
front of you but this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically where</font>

111
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,929
some of the flexibility is in being able

112
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,780
to cope with future technology so

113
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,370
eventually everyone wants to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1400 gig</font>

114
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,409
cereal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but unfortunately</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just not</font>

115
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:30,560
possible with the current technology so

116
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,200
right now it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a multi-lane</font>

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,640
solution for 49 our gig eventually

118
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,219
though we'll get there with technology

119
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,180
that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow us to do a serially so</font>

120
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,940
you can see there's always some

121
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,670
provisions in there for actually you

122
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:47,450
know doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-lane down to one lane</font>

123
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:49,280
which would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> cereal so the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

124
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,020
interesting objective that's just

125
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,580
completely undefined as provide

126
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,430
appropriate support for Chanin we've

127
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,140
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a little bit before</font>

128
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,880
basically 10 gig Ethernet has a what's

129
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,710
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wiz which is the way</font>

130
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,290
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub layer I think that's kind</font>

131
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,419
of a fun word to say it's missing from

132
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:07,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">4100 gig because they've taken that out</font>

133
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,900
in 10 gigs it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

134
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,480
complicated and a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> awkward</font>

135
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you have to you know translate</font>

136
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,100
10 gig Ethernet into sonic framing and

137
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,980
it doesn't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a 10 gig line</font>

138
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,350
rate because of the framing so there's

139
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,660
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of work between the itu-t and</font>

140
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:27,020
the I Triple E to transparently map

141
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:29,120
Ethernet into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw infrastructure and</font>

142
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,729
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I want to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

143
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,160
have these little URLs at the bottom

144
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:35,960
which point you to the full presentation

145
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,730
so these are all available to the public

146
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,760
if you want to download and read<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

147
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:42,800
details but basically it's been worked

148
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,390
out between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU and the I Triple E</font>

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,090
about how exactly that's going to happen

150
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:49,310
and then who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to define like how</font>

151
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,859
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> works and then the other things</font>

152
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,240
instron thing thing that I've always

153
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,760
been mentioning is you know we want

154
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ethernet to be as reliable and have some</font>

155
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:59,240
of the same characteristics as far as

156
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,340
troubleshooting monitoring that people

157
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,990
like about sonnet so link fault

158
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">signaling and those kind of things are</font>

159
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">feasible it's not in the specification</font>

160
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:14,159
to work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why that</font>

161
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:17,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">shouldn't work for otn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

162
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,820
obviously there is a something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

163
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:23,680
Todd yeah you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I should have</font>

164
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:25,780
checked these slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's talk</font>

165
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,710
a little bit about the specifics of<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

166
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,330
type of objective that end in more

167
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:33,909
detail and I try to kind of make this

168
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:36,070
applicable to operators which

169
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,840
unfortunately is is under the text so

170
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,330
the backplane solution is kind of

171
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,799
interesting not necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> for running</font>

172
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,300
a big network but in terms of what can

173
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,380
happen with blade servers and that kind

174
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,390
of technology this was really heavily I

175
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:52,120
don't want to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> pushed but Intel and</font>

176
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,190
some of the the blade server vendors had

177
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,210
a big interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font>

178
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be interesting the</font>

179
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,620
possibilities that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see with a high</font>

180
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,500
density and<font color="#E5E5E5"> high capacity blade servers</font>

181
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:03,460
in the future but basically this

182
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:07,600
technology is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to oughta go she ate</font>

183
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:10,690
from 1 to 40 gigs so as server capacity

184
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,980
and capabilities increase I think blade

185
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,980
server is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be very interesting</font>

186
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,300
it basically is based on CH ng base KR

187
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,130
which is the 10 gig backplane

188
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,470
specification and it does sort of the

189
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,900
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> things now the one bullet that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

190
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:26,110
kinda want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is influence of</font>

191
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,580
Triple E so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tripoli is a project in the</font>

192
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,700
I Triple E called energy-efficient

193
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:33,340
Ethernet and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically introducing</font>

194
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,530
some new control frames to drop the

195
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,739
power when systems are idle to reduce

196
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:40,750
the usage this will probably have an

197
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,770
influence on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backplane technology</font>

198
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,390
you can see if you have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of blade</font>

199
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,130
servers that could have a 40 gig

200
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:46,590
capacity and they're not doing anything

201
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:49,690
and makes sense that kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of drop that</font>

202
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:51,400
utilization or the capacity down to one

203
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,210
gig and then raise it again when they're

204
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:57,669
they're busy talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

205
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,729
these are broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the copper cable</font>

206
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:04,180
specification basically also reuses 10g

207
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:07,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">base KR and the cable parameters are</font>

208
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,650
based on 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> gb cx4 I think cx4 is</font>

209
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,990
personally a terrible an awkward

210
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:13,929
connector<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope we don't have to reuse</font>

211
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:16,810
that but the cable parameters are based

212
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:18,639
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> cx4 it also does out of negotiation</font>

213
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,560
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other thing I want</font>

214
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,210
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> out is that we're trying to figure</font>

215
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,430
out you know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a connector for</font>

216
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:27,580
this kind of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the current</font>

217
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:31,840
proposal is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a four-lane solution</font>

218
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:34,149
would use qsfp qsfp is a quad sfp it's a

219
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,159
basically a high-density pluggable media

220
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:38,828
that has you know for four lanes in it

221
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,708
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten lane solution would use</font>

222
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:43,510
something called sff 80 92 it's a new

223
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,459
small form-factor pluggable standard

224
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:47,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on but again</font>

225
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:52,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a high-density connector for a</font>

226
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:55,300
copper or fiber for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100-meter om3</font>

227
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:58,660
multimode fiber solutions basically it's

228
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:00,250
a parallel solution I don't want to say

229
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,110
it's a ribbon cable because that kind of

230
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,550
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know gives people the wrong</font>

231
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,310
impression but it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some</font>

232
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:07,420
sort of high density fiber connector

233
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would go into a high tendency</font>

234
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,779
connector and then people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

235
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,579
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know well we want to</font>

236
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:15,880
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things go further than 100</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metres</font>

237
00:09:12,579 --> 00:09:17,560
can we do to 300 and then the OM for

238
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,269
fiber manufacturers are talking about

239
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">well you know we could go farther over</font>

240
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:24,310
14 this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is possibly one technical</font>

241
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,160
objective that still could be amended

242
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,079
based on what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are able to</font>

243
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,550
actually do when they get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> samples</font>

244
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:35,319
working the 40 kilometer<font color="#CCCCCC"> single mode</font>

245
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,750
solution this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the heavily</font>

246
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:41,320
debated ones and the bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line is that</font>

247
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:44,290
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a cwdm grid and it's</font>

248
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run these lambdas and then the</font>

249
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:50,740
hunter gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> single mode solutions again</font>

250
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,990
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the heavily debated objectives in</font>

251
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,290
the I Triple E and this one is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

252
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:57,940
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LAN WDM solution and the thing I</font>

253
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:58,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is that again you</font>

254
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,910
know we're talking about flexible

255
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,310
architecture and future technology so

256
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,860
right now if you notice on the back end

257
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,500
going into the block diagram<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all</font>

258
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:10,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten lanes of 10 gigs so basically this</font>

259
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,750
is based on a 10 gig<font color="#CCCCCC"> series intended</font>

260
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">electrical technology so as we get the</font>

261
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,010
capability to do fast reelect<font color="#CCCCCC"> racal</font>

262
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,990
technology we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically whack off</font>

263
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:24,130
the whole back end of that and just do

264
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,110
four times<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 25 gig into the block and</font>

265
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,720
then that will save a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost and</font>

266
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,860
components

267
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,930
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just an</font>

268
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,660
example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how technology can</font>

269
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,089
change and how this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> built re</font>

270
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,870
allow for that technology in the future

271
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:39,860
and then those newer generation

272
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:44,389
components and technology will allow us

273
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:46,910
to drive the cost down the hunter gig<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40</font>

274
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:48,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">kilometer is basically the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same diagram</font>

275
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,959
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's just an amplifier in</font>

276
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:54,740
there because it has to go further and

277
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:56,660
this uses the same grid spacing and

278
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:00,500
again same thing here we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 lanes</font>

279
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:02,149
of 10 gig going into the block and as we

280
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">have new technology that allow us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

281
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:08,420
to do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> by 25</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right where are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

282
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:10,910
now so someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent three years since I</font>

283
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:14,509
started doing these updates and we're at

284
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:18,980
least halfway there again draft 10 is a

285
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:20,930
big big achievement and basically summer

286
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,100
of two thousand ten will see the

287
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,508
standard here's a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more detailed</font>

288
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,000
timeline from the I Triple E the things

289
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:33,889
I want to point out<font color="#E5E5E5"> here are the draft 1</font>

290
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">20 20 and 30 dates in here so when</font>

291
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:37,399
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know when</font>

292
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,410
vendors are going to have technology

293
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,509
kind of keep these dates in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind because</font>

294
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:45,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are when the big changes happened</font>

295
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:47,300
and one question<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

296
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,149
when are we going to have this well if

297
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:54,109
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the timeline draft 20 is</font>

298
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:55,639
going to be the last technical change so

299
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,970
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are going to have a</font>

300
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:02,420
reasonably reasonably good idea what's

301
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:05,000
going to happen by sort of summer of

302
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,979
next year and then if you figure it

303
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,920
takes three to six months to do an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASIC</font>

304
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,870
then basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> nurs have to sell that to</font>

305
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,689
router vendors router vendors have to

306
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,449
take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the board so i think</font>

307
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:19,339
we'll start seeing some some product out

308
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:23,959
there by end of year<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2009 I think that's</font>

309
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:26,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty reasonable date future meetings</font>

310
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:29,180
basically the meetings are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

311
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:31,129
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring comment resolution is</font>

312
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,750
probably one of the most tedious<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

313
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:35,029
that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> ever been through in my entire</font>

314
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,040
life it's basically where you look at

315
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">everywhere of the draft and criticize</font>

316
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,399
every war

317
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:42,069
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like you know there's a comma</font>

318
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,379
missing on this sentence and like a

319
00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:46,540
ticket gets open for every comment and

320
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:48,730
then we all sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a room and go over it</font>

321
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:50,019
and vote on accepting the changes and

322
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,449
there's a lot of technical changes that

323
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:55,180
happen to but I mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

324
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:59,399
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fine-tooth comb and that'll take</font>

325
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:02,349
several meetings actually here's the

326
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">website everything like i said is public</font>

327
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,970
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> download it and read about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

328
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,829
as much detail as you want here's the

329
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">nomenclature this is just for your</font>

330
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,540
reference really but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> explains you</font>

331
00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:15,430
know how we come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all these fancy</font>

332
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,349
nomenclature and then these last five

333
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:21,329
slides are just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the detailed</font>

334
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:21,329
how we get there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's a scanner</font>

335
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:26,639
any questions

336
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:35,640
hey Todd Underwood there are rumors and

337
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:37,380
insinuations that there are existing

338
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,540
vendor implementations can you talk

339
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,040
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> companies or any of your</font>

340
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,930
competitors in what the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale for</font>

341
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,290
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether those are free standards</font>

342
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:48,209
or what you know what standard there

343
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,250
yeah so there's there's been a lot of

344
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,870
demos and this is good because it's good

345
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:54,060
for people to demo<font color="#CCCCCC"> that technology</font>

346
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,220
there's been a lot of demos specifically

347
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,290
around 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig technology and I say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

348
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gig technology because that's</font>

349
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:01,170
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred gig Ethernet</font>

350
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,840
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the standard</font>

351
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,699
it can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet until the standard</font>

352
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,920
is done but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

353
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,140
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that technology again I</font>

354
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,360
would just say that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the draft</font>

355
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:14,910
schedule is pretty well defined so draft

356
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,860
10 we have a pretty a good idea of

357
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on draft 20 we have a lot</font>

358
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,750
better idea and then draft 30 you know

359
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> standard is pretty much done so</font>

360
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:27,510
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people are talking about</font>

361
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I mean draft 10 just came out</font>

362
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:33,960
a few weeks ago so it would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

363
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:36,030
really pretty standard so I would just I

364
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,610
just caution people to to use this

365
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,819
timeline and evaluate what vendors are

366
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,820
saying
