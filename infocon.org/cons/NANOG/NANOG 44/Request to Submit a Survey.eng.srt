00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's cool Tom's going to talk about a</font>

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:16,680
survey he's working on that is quite

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:20,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting hi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Tom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Shaw with AT&T</font>

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,340
and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically put a survey together</font>

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,099
purposes<font color="#CCCCCC"> distributing in here at nanog</font>

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:27,750
and what the survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really about it's</font>

7
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,320
obvious to network operators so it seems

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:34,410
pretty relevant for the group here and

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,700
some of the main things covered in it is

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,860
really what technologies are deployed

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,750
today what practices are<font color="#CCCCCC"> being used</font>

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,450
within a network and really to determine

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,769
maybe what are people doing and

14
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:45,780
potentially what other<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems people</font>

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to run into as things grow</font>

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,399
over the next few years and hopefully

17
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,959
can you know turn you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know perhaps ideas</font>

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,090
into topics of things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be</font>

19
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,710
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about or presentations to come</font>

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,360
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it but just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to really find out</font>

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,410
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of where everyone's at and you know</font>

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,030
one of the things is obviously not

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,288
everyone's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about you know</font>

24
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,600
how they do things in their<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and</font>

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:05,489
in kind of open forum generally I mean

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,729
this proprietary information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot</font>

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so it's just kind of anonymous</font>

28
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,000
survey just to relieve I know what

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,760
what's enabled in people's networks and

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,680
what's going on so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know by</font>

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,920
people filling it out and the URLs at

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:23,220
the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the slides and hopefully we</font>

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:27,090
can get something I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty</font>

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">beneficial for everyone so who's this</font>

35
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,299
targeted that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much anybody</font>

36
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,130
you know if your network service

provider selling transit you know

38
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,570
engaging and peering content hosting

39
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,850
access providers enterprises pretty much

40
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:41,939
anybody so you know if you have enabled

41
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,579
on a box and you run a network of some

42
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,449
sort this would probably be aiming for

43
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:50,429
you some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the questions that are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font>

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,799
covered in it it kind of spans several

45
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,659
different up areas and the first one is

46
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,579
routing technologies appearing

47
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,810
operational practices how you do things

48
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,339
within your network when you the

49
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,680
day-to-day maintenance events things

50
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:04,070
like that network performance how do you

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,259
know monitor things in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

52
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:09,179
security and future concerns going

53
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:10,740
forward as to you know as it relates to

54
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors hardware equipment</font>

55
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,310
potential few features things like that

56
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,580
and I'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through some of these</font>

57
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,320
through each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these first one is</font>

58
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,390
routing technologies basically going

59
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,790
over do you run mpls or not in your

60
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,399
network if you do what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use to use</font>

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">ldp do you use rsvp-te is your signaling</font>

62
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,830
protocol or use a combination of<font color="#CCCCCC"> both if</font>

63
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:35,200
you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp for instance are you doing</font>

64
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:37,630
anything to detect label<font color="#CCCCCC"> ldp based black</font>

gb sink out of how do you mitigate

67
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,160
things like that if you're using rsvp-te

68
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's interesting what are you</font>

69
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,090
doing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it are you using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bama</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">preservations are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you how many</font>

71
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,990
individual LSPs do you have as a head

72
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:55,270
and on a router you know what kind of

73
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,410
scale are you building out and you know

74
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:57,760
if you're using constraint based routing

75
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,890
well what kind of constraints are you

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">using are you using affinities are you</font>

77
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,089
doing explicit path hops how are you

78
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,040
building your hops in your network

79
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,480
basically to find out you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what what</font>

80
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,739
are the popular methods in which people

81
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">are actually you know utilizing this</font>

82
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,850
today other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two there</font>

83
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">are three VPN services some people have</font>

84
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,390
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> some people don't but obviously each</font>

85
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,430
one has its own additional constraints

86
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,290
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know later through VPN services what</font>

87
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,030
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change how you you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know do</font>

88
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:23,980
engineering on your boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many you</font>

89
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,390
know VPN<font color="#CCCCCC"> rots can you store you know</font>

90
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,600
what's the impact on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the control plane</font>

91
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:30,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">ldp or bgp to actually do this you know</font>

92
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,010
do you have VPN router reflectors

93
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:37,330
deployed how many routes you have within

94
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:39,970
your network other things would be I GP

95
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,410
so you know what I GP do you use do you

96
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,680
use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like multi topology</font>

97
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,660
routing somewhat new and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also do tweak</font>

98
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,600
you know SPF timers do you lower your

99
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,670
default timers do you set different

100
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,500
hello data time intervals basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

101
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to find out what knobs people are</font>

102
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,620
really using on their network<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if</font>

103
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:58,420
they're actual by<font color="#E5E5E5"> options or it's only a</font>

104
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,320
few corner cases where people actually

105
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:05,350
do some of this next one obviously is

106
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:09,010
multicast and going into some options

107
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:11,350
there another topic covered would be

108
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:14,440
pairing and this is kind of a you know

109
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,779
Greg myself and I think run worked on

110
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:19,269
this a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> or so ago to go over pairing</font>

111
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:20,458
practices and you know what what's

112
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,620
enabled what do you

113
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,000
doing anything with<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP are using BFD</font>

114
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,009
and the results are pretty interesting

115
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,319
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of takes a little bit</font>

116
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">further to come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like what practices</font>

117
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,599
are you doing at public exchanges you

118
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,130
know at what point do you do engage in

119
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:36,569
any kind of private cross connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

120
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,610
any kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pairing and what percentage</font>

121
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">do you maybe consider upgrading a link</font>

122
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:41,970
or do you wait for people to call up you

123
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:43,919
know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of policies do you apply</font>

124
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:46,229
to peers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you doing community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> based</font>

125
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,940
on filtering or are you doing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

126
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,520
a prefix list and you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do</font>

127
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:53,280
anything on top of that you know

128
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,479
individual requirements and just a lot

129
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions as it relates to</font>

130
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,120
do you preserve like toss dscp bits as

131
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,859
they traverse your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know do</font>

132
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,199
you preserve med thing things like that

133
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other parts would be you know</font>

134
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,440
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering how frequently you</font>

135
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,699
know when you are pairing actively do

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,259
you actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> two deep rough paths</font>

137
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:15,419
because of performance or any other

138
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:17,190
reasons everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is operational</font>

139
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:18,659
practices and this goes into you know

140
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:22,110
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day-to-day operations of your</font>

141
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:24,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">network so anything like router</font>

142
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintence or when you cost out or divert</font>

143
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,539
traffic around a router do any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

144
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:28,949
maintenance work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and if so what</font>

145
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,690
kind of maintenance work it just

146
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:33,210

BGP neighbors are you do gracefully and

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,750
try to deep rough paths and things like

that just trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find out what is you</font>

rear out are they using mpls te based

199

faster you're out there you know who are

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,760
their individual applications that

201
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,440

00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:38,969
performance monitoring how you actually

209
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,460
you have probes actively in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

they running on the rotters themselves

00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,170
or do you have agents that set off the

to your transit providers things like

311
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,970
for you so it kind of goes into a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

312

<font color="#CCCCCC">different concerns and talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about 40</font>

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:24,969
opinion on that so and then I think so

318
00:11:27,699 --> 00:11:31,300
properly well done question or you need

319
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:33,129
to have I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess additional feedback to</font>

320
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:36,310
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd actually submit it there</font>

321
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:38,529
and that's pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it the</font>

322
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:41,529
hopefully the you know get one response

323
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:43,240
/ organization and the survey is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,060
record any IP addresses so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

326
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:47,649
trying to identify who's actually

327
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:50,229
submitting these and trying to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

328
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:51,459
anonymous as possible and hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

329
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:52,839
leave it open for a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks or at</font>

330
00:11:51,459 --> 00:11:54,310
least until<font color="#CCCCCC"> it seems like nobody you</font>

331
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,589
know submitting anything any longer on

332
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,300
it and then basically produce the

333
00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:00,579
results in a nice format and either send

334
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:08,139
