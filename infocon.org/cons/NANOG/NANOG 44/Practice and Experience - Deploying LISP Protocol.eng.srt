00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,710
please start heading this way dave is a

director in Cisco's<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced</font>

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:14,099
technologies group<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably something</font>

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:17,039
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and it's at the University of</font>

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,369
Oregon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking with</font>

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,699
us about Lisp and making routing scale

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:26,490
into you know Stella next decade<font color="#E5E5E5"> South</font>

8
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:29,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">vegetable um ok so this talks about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp</font>

9
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:30,509
I wanted it to be mostly about what

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,740
we've deployed in one hour practice and

11
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,930
experiences but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to give you guys</font>

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit of a background first I'm</font>

13
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,190
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to go through that as fast</font>

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,809
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible so we could talk about</font>

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,218
what's out there right now but I also

16
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,579
didn't want to say that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of</font>

17
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,110
people here are all active in

18
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:47,670
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> and deployment and of Lisp</font>

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,500
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's it's a kind of a teamwork</font>

20
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,270
thing so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go so here's my agenda</font>

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lisbon a nutshell that's the part where</font>

22
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,079
I want to tell you about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

23
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,690
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what it's really all about if</font>

24
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,699
you're not living this day to day it can

25
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,229
seem kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of obscure and then I wanted</font>

26
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to show you what that what we put out to</font>

27
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,860
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> field some about the deployment</font>

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,810
model how we're trying to build names

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,330
and numbers how you might configure it

30
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,360
on the router on your router what we're

31
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,860
doing future wise few open questions

32
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,320
what our active drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are if you want</font>

33
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,820
to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and then some Q&A if we</font>

34
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:26,850
have time so so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it locator ID</font>

35
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,529
separation protocol list how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

36
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:32,460
have been following<font color="#E5E5E5"> this locator ID</font>

37
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,549
split technology issue raise your hand

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,039
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have okay so let me just say this</font>

39
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,979
at the 10,000 mile view the idea here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

40
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,180
IP address overloaded with both both

41
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,429
location and identity and identity since

42
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,320
location since routing really has to

43
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow addressing to scale to be</font>

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,669
aggregated there's a there's a tension

45
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,860
there so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that if you split</font>

46
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,810
location from ID then you can get the

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,579
course ID of the routing to scale better

48
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,790
because you can have it aggregate more

49
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,559
aggregate able and then on the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

50
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,719
the ID side of it you can also get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,429
to aggregate because you can you can be

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,538
couple it from the topology and we'll

53
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,520
see how that<font color="#CCCCCC"> works in a segment so</font>

54
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:12,630
that's like the 10,000 mile view of what

55
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,750
the hope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the low</font>

56
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,220
Gator ID split thing is so we have

57
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,960
endpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifiers as we call them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> e</font>

58
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,940
IDs this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our terminology for</font>

59
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,190
numbering hosts that's what like you'd

60
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,760
look up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in that DNS when you you</font>

61
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,740
know when you try to resolve the name we

62
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,690
have topological routing locators that's

63
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,290
what's in the core right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now those don't</font>

64
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,820
change and then list was mapping and a

65
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,179
map and encapsulation how many people

66
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,070
have heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we'll see</font>

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">what mapping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end cap means but basically</font>

68
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:44,820
if you want to have two numbers spaces

69
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,560
and you only have 32 bits like you have

70
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,540
an ipv4 you got to put another header on

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,210
to get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other bits so that's the map</font>

72
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,650
and in cap part but we'll see that which

73
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,770
we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that didn't</font>

74
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:57,960
require host changes because host

75
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:02,340
changes always seem to be a you know

76
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:04,290
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that slows us down a lot no</font>

77
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,180
new addressing insights we want sites to

78
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:08,850
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use their own addressing</font>

79
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,580
schemes and devices trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the</font>

80
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:13,290
configuration down and we'll see that we

81
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted it to be incrementally deployable</font>

82
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:20,070
and address family agnostic so ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6</font>

83
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:23,490
MAC addresses whatever there's tutorials

84
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,290
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> wws for net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too if you want to see</font>

85
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:27,690
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that some of the talks that</font>

86
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,609
we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> given</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around there's tuning</font>

87
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,950
network elements here<font color="#CCCCCC"> too on one's</font>

88
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,960
called ITR<font color="#CCCCCC"> ingresa tunnel routing this</font>

89
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,690
by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> this terminology is kind of</font>

90
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:39,090
found its way into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lexicon abut all</font>

91
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,030
of this so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty standard now but</font>

92
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the this is the device</font>

93
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,200
that sits<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the edge of your network</font>

94
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that finds the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Eid to our local map</font>

95
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,970
that's the map part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> map and account</font>

96
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,360
and then it encapsulates to the locator

97
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,890
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> our loke at the source site and</font>

98
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,300
that's the ink<font color="#E5E5E5"> a part and of course it</font>

99
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,970
sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> it across to the other end that</font>

100
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">decap slates it that's the ETR and then</font>

101
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:06,300
senses on sends it on to this location

102
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside the side so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ETR and ITR think</font>

103
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,209
about the ITR is the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does the</font>

104
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,519
encapsulants the mapping does

105
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,750
encapsulation<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTR is the thing that D</font>

106
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,220
capsulate sit at the destination site

107
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:18,600
one other thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is we've kind</font>

108
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,840
of taken to this terminology that we

109
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,410
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> xt are like little you'll see this</font>

110
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:26,570
times a little xtr the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex is we you see</font>

111
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,880
Zach's once both an ITR and an ETR which

112
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,389
is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> common so here's how that list</font>

113
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,409
data plane works this is the map and

114
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:36,500
encapsulate the stock will try to keep

115
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,840
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SROs the green things and the</font>

116
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,139
routing locators are the our logs are in

117
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:47,560
red and in this example there's a

118
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:49,970
mapping entry in in the ITR s1 and s2

119
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,260
that it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it got it</font>

120
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,280
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it could have been static it</font>

121
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,900
could have learned it through a mapping

122
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,520
system or whatever but it has a mapping

123
00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:00,130
and basically that's let's see we have a

124
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,280
laser pointer here will that<font color="#CCCCCC"> work no</font>

125
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:08,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">well yeah well it I don't know how to</font>

126
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,250
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right yeah um so</font>

127
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,659
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mapping this mapping</font>

128
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,760
entry<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's this mapping entry</font>

129
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,560
there that mapping entry basically says

130
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:19,130
if you have this prefix the ID prefix

131
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,430
green tea / 8 then when you're

132
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:25,490
encapsulating it send it to the routing

133
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,139
locator 1200 to or 1300 to with

134
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,200
priorities and which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain what</font>

135
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,720
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> later but just for now imagine</font>

136
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,570
that either of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itrs on the left side</font>

137
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,070
umm have that mapping so what happens is

138
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:42,070
this host s wants to send a packet to on

139
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,599
the host ich and host these addresses

140
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,330
2002 you just look<font color="#CCCCCC"> that up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

141
00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:49,520
like today so it gets the<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns entry and</font>

142
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,260
now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to send the packet</font>

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,120
like it does today right and what it

144
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:57,950
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not so right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

145
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,550
salmon animation got crushed out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

146
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:04,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">i might have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just talk through that</font>

147
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:06,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok i guess there's no animation in here</font>

148
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,229
um let me just talk through it then for

149
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:12,289
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm basically what happens is the</font>

150
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:15,139
packet gets sent from ass gets to s1 and

151
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:18,560
s2 either whichever one you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

152
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,300
GP routing takes it to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's s say</font>

153
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,789
it's s2 in this case what else to does

154
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,530
is it encapsulates it in the routing

155
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:25,820
locator that it chooses for this

156
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:28,580
particular one and it does that by

157
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,050
hashing to the into the into the mapping

158
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,960
entry so what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it puts a</font>

159
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,210
header on it that says

160
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> destination is 1200 to which</font>

161
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:42,090
is the eid which is interesting we're

162
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:44,400
going to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that way and the source</font>

163
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:51,539
is actually the routing locator of the

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:54,719
ITR thanks I know if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font>

165
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,300
work either<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright well I can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

166
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">see it from here so anyway what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

167
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,690
to happen here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the packet gets</font>

168
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,310
encapsulated with the header that looks

169
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:03,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like this right here let's see if I</font>

170
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,740
could get that to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> right there</font>

171
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">right that's what the packet looks like</font>

172
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,910
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get sent across the</font>

173
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet as it is as the network is</font>

174
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:15,060
today 212 2002 and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

175
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,419
side it's just going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get d capsulated</font>

176
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,849
and and the EGR over here is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

177
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to d capsulate it and send it along so</font>

178
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:25,590
it's pretty simple right basically you

179
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,530
look up a host IP address turns out to

180
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,239
be an eid in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS you send the packet</font>

181
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,008
along your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP to the border the border</font>

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,650
encapsulate the packet because it has

183
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:36,900
the it has this mapping entry we'll see

184
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,370
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got that in a second and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then it</font>

185
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,560
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sends it across the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D capsulate sir</font>

186
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,150
notice that that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the e IDs</font>

187
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,220
even though we're calling them identify

188
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:46,948
errs have to be routable in that inter

189
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:50,099
domain scout so over here and over here

190
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:51,840
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then the bar loucks are</font>

191
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,090
routable in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if</font>

192
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is working at all but it'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

193
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,500
easier if the animation actually worked

194
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,139
here but ok so that's basically the

195
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">mapping cap operation so you can think</font>

196
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:04,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as just send a packet to the</font>

197
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:10,530
border encapsulate it to the other side

198
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:12,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D capsulated that's it now now now</font>

199
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:13,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm an h er and I'm thinking how do I</font>

200
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,419
get that how do I get this mapping I

201
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:19,159
need that mapping to find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side</font>

202
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:22,159
well the system we've tried a bunch of

203
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,159
Vince

204
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:29,630
yeah thanks that'll be helpful because I

205
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:31,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so how do i find</font>

206
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:33,169
the mapping<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's that's that's</font>

207
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,270
another part that this whole equation

208
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:36,740
right well we've tried we've looked at a

209
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,809
bunch of different mapping systems and

210
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,700
we designed a couple when we and the the

211
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,770
one that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of have settled on is</font>

212
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:45,590
called alt for alternate topology so we

213
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,870
call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> list + alt and basically it's a</font>

214
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:50,570
hybrid<font color="#E5E5E5"> push-pull the alt the old</font>

215
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:53,930
infrastructure aggregates and the list

216
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,240
and the list itrs actually pull the

217
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,739
specific mappings right so there's a

218
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,930
higher and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the Eid</font>

219
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,910
prefix allocation hierarchical because

220
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,040
if we have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing get completely d</font>

221
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,140
aggregated then we all we've done is

222
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,370
move the problem we have in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that core to</font>

223
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,900
the mapping system and we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

224
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:11,870
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because then we've got we</font>

225
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:14,510
haven't want anything so we keep we're

226
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:17,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to keep the Eid prefixes really</font>

227
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">coarsely aggregated and the way we do</font>

228
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,320
this is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just run it over a GRE</font>

229
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,910
overlay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what the alt is is</font>

230
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:29,540
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an instance of BGP that carries eid</font>

231
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:33,949
prefixes that runs over GRE and it's

232
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:36,890
used by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs the ITRs to find</font>

233
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:40,370
mapping so basically it's just another

234
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:44,000
instance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP and this is going to be</font>

235
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:46,040
tough because yeah all right I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

236
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,570
think i'm going to be able to really

237
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,069
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a feeling without the animation</font>

238
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:53,800
here but let me see if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can do it</font>

239
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:58,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyway so basically what happens here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

240
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:00,010
same situation before the host on the

241
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,990
left that would be on the left your left

242
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:05,689
so it says ITR it would look up the

243
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:09,830
destination address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 40 s</font>

244
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:11,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">there 241 11 and basically what that ITR</font>

245
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,900
would do then is it would say okay you

246
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if I okay it would say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well I</font>

247
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to find a mapping for this thing</font>

248
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,890
because when the packet gets to the

249
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:20,990
border if it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a mapping it's</font>

250
00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:22,520
got to go look it up right so it's

251
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:26,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking it up and the way it's doing it</font>

252
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:30,350
is it sends a map request to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

253
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:32,569
side so this packet that and I know

254
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:36,140
I think I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the pointer myself</font>

255
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:40,040
if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it you got it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so the packet</font>

256
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:44,569
looks like outer header has 1100 one in

257
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:46,699
it and the destination is 240 240<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1111</font>

258
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,860
now the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is you send</font>

259
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,440
this packet on the all right and the alt

260
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,300
itself is carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Eid prefixes so</font>

261
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,280
basically it routes the package to

262
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">select be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gtp does to the person</font>

263
00:10:55,280 --> 00:11:00,050
advertising it well<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's advertising it</font>

264
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,210
well it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETR on the other side so</font>

265
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:04,010
the ETR on the other side of this on the

266
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,930
right side it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really too bad the</font>

267
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,890
animation isn't here but on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> run on</font>

268
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:11,810
your right side um gets the packet right

269
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:13,400
and then it gets this map or plot this

270
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:15,650
map request and it sends a map reply

271
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,140
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so there's a there's a request</font>

272
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:21,079
reply thing here and you can't see it

273
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,460
because you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't see it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh anyway</font>

274
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's what that's the way it works and</font>

275
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll put these slides up somewhere but I</font>

276
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,290
don't spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> more time on this now</font>

277
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,820
because this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of broken and it</font>

278
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:32,180
won't health but basically the idea here

279
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:34,820
is the etrs advertised the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eid prefixes</font>

280
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,670
that they are authoritative for when an

281
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,980
ITR gets a packet that it doesn't have a

282
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:41,719
mapping for it sends a map-request<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font>

283
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,940
the salt thing again which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

284
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,510
instance of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP that runs in a separate</font>

285
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">verve over GRE tunnels that reps the map</font>

286
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,260
request packet to the EGR that's

287
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,960
authoritative for it and it sends a map

288
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,400
reply back and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden the</font>

289
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,570
ITR has the mapping and it can

290
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:59,000
encapsulate the packet and send it

291
00:11:56,570 --> 00:12:00,620
directly so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that works it's</font>

292
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,140
not the picture kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looks</font>

293
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,090
complicated here because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

294
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,360
crushed the whole lot animation into one

295
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:10,880
slide but maybe it should have um so

296
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,370
that was going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my tutorial on this</font>

297
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,130
so um since my two slides that were

298
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,020
crucial to that weren't there um maybe

299
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just take a quick break and kind of</font>

300
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:21,380
get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea do people have a sense and</font>

301
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,760
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to know exactly how it</font>

302
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">works now but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a sense of</font>

303
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,680
what it does basically on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data plane</font>

304
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,940
what you do is you encapsulate the

305
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,319
package sent it to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

306
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,830
caps later right it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple in</font>

307
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the control plane the alt you advertise</font>

308
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:39,290
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in each er what yagi prefix is your</font>

309
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,670
authoritative for and then 1 i'm on the

310
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,199
ITR side and I'm

311
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,640
a packet I don't have a mapping for it I

312
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,490
just send a map-request into the all

313
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,100
which because it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance of BGP</font>

314
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:50,900
on this other address space the packet

315
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,850
finds its way to the authoritative EGR

316
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:53,990
which sends a map reply back and then

317
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,700
the guy has the mapping and can

318
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,910
encapsulate the packer that's about it

319
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:01,960
really it's the whole thing of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

320
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:06,380
always the Devils in the details now

321
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:08,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so was that look like okay so we</font>

322
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:10,910
built so we took this approach that on

323
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,290
rather than rather than writing up a

324
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:15,170
bunch of pic well we wrote up a bunch of

325
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,449
paper to who we can we made a lot of

326
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,709
paper but we really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

327
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,810
something into the field<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could</font>

328
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,400
see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would really work and get some</font>

329
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:25,189
practice some experience with it because

330
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,810
a lot of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

331
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:29,120
there's a lot of study and a lot of

332
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:30,560
paper but we what we found is by trying

333
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to implement it and trying to deploy it</font>

334
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,069
we've learned so much and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

335
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:38,000
show you how far we've gotten we have

336
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:39,800
like 25 sites up right now and they're

337
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,470
all they're all they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> all logged</font>

338
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:47,479
PB six sites but we have ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 and</font>

339
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:48,770
mixed so um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get on that www list</font>

340
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,070
for and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of see this picture in a</font>

341
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,420
little bit more detail so here's our

342
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:57,620
deployment model this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

343
00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:00,050
talk about right now what we're doing is

344
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,150
we have a where we have the

345
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,500
implementation running on one hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> UPC's</font>

346
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,770
they're called Titanium's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

347
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:10,280
exactly sure why<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a it's just a one</font>

348
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:13,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">hour UPC with some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> diggy interfaces on</font>

349
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:16,130
it there's a lisp capable version of

350
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,500
nx-os which denotes developing and then

351
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are 0 s implementations are</font>

352
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,140
underway we want to see if we can run it

353
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:26,750
in a is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours class box and there is an</font>

354
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:31,310
open source implementation that's semi

355
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:33,800
complete its I think I don't I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

356
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:35,869
it's one speck revision oddest out of

357
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of sync right now so those guys need</font>

358
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:39,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the latest spec and upgrade but</font>

359
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:42,829
um they had it up an inter operating

360
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,440
with the previous spec revision we made

361
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,060
a change I know if I have this in here

362
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,560
but we made a change in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet</font>

363
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,390
format so you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought of this</font>

364
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,729
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying us so we could</font>

365
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,220
piggyback the mapping

366
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:55,870
on the map request because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send you</font>

367
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,519
a map request because I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

368
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,139
you what are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chances you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

369
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,060
going to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to me pretty low</font>

370
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,350
right so why don't I just send the

371
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,479
mapping data that you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

372
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,100
for anyway on the map request that was

373
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">changed we just made and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea came</font>

374
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nokia about a year ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something</font>

375
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,149
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were working on another mapping</font>

376
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:16,269
system and we kind of finally got around

377
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:18,329
in corania so that's sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

378
00:15:16,269 --> 00:15:20,440
hardware software environment on

379
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:21,670
endpoint identifies remember us saying

380
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,230
we really wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep these</font>

381
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,420
aggregated because if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do that</font>

382
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:27,250
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> just move the problems that we</font>

383
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,199
have in the DFC right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

384
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:32,019
mapping system so we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

385
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:36,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">this geographically and kind of along</font>

386
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:38,380
the lines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rirs so that's kind of</font>

387
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea we have and basically then we</font>

388
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,740
have these boxes that were calling all

389
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:43,000
aggregators which are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

390
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,560
aggregate these things up either

391
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,600
continental<font color="#E5E5E5"> e regionally or things like</font>

392
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,290
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> geographically</font>

393
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,490
and they're placed strategically around

394
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,319
and then we have this GRE tunnel

395
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,990
topology remember the alt runs over this

396
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,850
GRE topology and basically it's

397
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,649
partially matched at the top so these

398
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:02,819
all to a greater continental level of

399
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,810
things or roughly continental level

400
00:16:02,819 --> 00:16:06,279
aggregators are all kind of partially

401
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:08,229
meshed together and then all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sites</font>

402
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,209
are kind of on stars around those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

403
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention one thing is that</font>

404
00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:14,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the alt actually doesn't require you to</font>

405
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,910
use GRE you just need some tunneling

406
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,470
technology that will allow you to

407
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:22,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">decouple the actual physical topology</font>

408
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,610
from from the alt apology so in some

409
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:29,230
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my test bed thing I have</font>

410
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:30,730
it running on dot1q in some places so

411
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:33,130
we've also we've also been thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

412
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:36,160
lot about<font color="#CCCCCC"> interworking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were thinking</font>

413
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:37,600
about transition I think we started

414
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,480
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this as transition you</font>

415
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,990
know but like the ipv6 transition

416
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,250
schemes transition might be forever so

417
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:47,589
we might we might as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well call it</font>

418
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,300
interworking so we did we up to two ways

419
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:52,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it we have what we call this</font>

420
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,889
translation and that's just looking at

421
00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,649
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you that later and then we</font>

422
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:58,420
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> proxy tunnel router which is</font>

423
00:16:55,649 --> 00:17:01,240
basically a box that what it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

424
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,370
a grits the Eid prefix into the DFC not

425
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,449
into the also into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alt but into the</font>

426
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:06,399
DFC

427
00:17:04,449 --> 00:17:08,860
to attract traffic from the outside

428
00:17:06,398 --> 00:17:10,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet to this box and once it gets</font>

429
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:13,479
there then it just behaves like an ITR

430
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:21,069
so that allow you to talk to list sites

431
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:22,449
from outside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lisp world there's also</font>

432
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:23,980
this other thing about interworking that

433
00:17:22,449 --> 00:17:26,139
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at so there's there's</font>

434
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:29,950
interworking between lisp and nonlin

435
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:32,799
sites but there's also four and six so

436
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:35,500
you might want to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

437
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:39,220
map-request<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to a map request for our</font>

438
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,230
IP v6e ID prefix or<font color="#E5E5E5"> EIG with a v4</font>

439
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:43,240
locator and we're calling these mixed

440
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:46,690
locators and and the point of doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

441
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,620
is so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can connect ipv6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Islands</font>

442
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:52,990
over ipv4 without an intervening a

443
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:53,979
native<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 capable network and we'll</font>

444
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:56,860
see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more about this in a</font>

445
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,539
second but these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of things</font>

446
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,158
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been trying to do trying to think</font>

447
00:17:58,539 --> 00:18:03,250
through you know how are we really going

448
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get this deployed so we have some</font>

449
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">network numbers too here's what we did</font>

450
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:10,179
so Andrew part an<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were sitting around</font>

451
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">in I ETF or something talking about this</font>

452
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:15,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">and he goes oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well I happen to have a /</font>

453
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,860
16 like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's cool Anna it's</font>

454
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,210
this one 5316 if you look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

455
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,189
who is on it you'll find out you'll find

456
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:23,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">some information about the varied</font>

457
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:27,760
history of this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I got</font>

458
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:29,860
this this / 32 for ipv6 from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

459
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,799
environmental it's experimental

460
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,399
allocation so both of these turn up in

461
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,580
the DFC for internet working purposes

462
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:42,279
Andrews advertising 153 16 and I'm

463
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:44,500
advertising the Eid prefix I'm we want

464
00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:47,080
to you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to advertise this</font>

465
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,730
both of these prefixes with a consistent

466
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,620
origin from various<font color="#E5E5E5"> places around the</font>

467
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,700
network still have sore than any<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast</font>

468
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:58,600
effect we were numbering the tunnels out

469
00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:00,220
of 240 / 4 and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using 4-byte asn s</font>

470
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,529
and the format we're using is shown

471
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,360
there but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that's just what's</font>

472
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:05,830
implemented right now whether or not we

473
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,840
do a s plane or whatever

474
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:12,250
depends on how it all<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes but that's</font>

475
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,320
just the format we're using for now so

476
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:16,960
we have some names out there to list for

477
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,029
net has the ipv4 less be ID prefix isn't

478
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,429
it and there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> exception if you look</font>

479
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:25,870
at www translate that list for net

480
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:27,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a I think it's in 128 22 31 56 57</font>

481
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:31,959
or something but basically this is just

482
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:33,820
the upstream router that has that that

483
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,159
points that the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> nap just like the</font>

484
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard NAT would do it and then the</font>

485
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:41,380
ipv6 eid prefixes are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

486
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:46,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">donna you know as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you might imagine list</font>

487
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:47,740
net was gone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to list people the list</font>

488
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,799
programming language<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were not</font>

489
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:53,980
happy I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was more fun than</font>

490
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">they did so how do you do this I mean if</font>

491
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,710
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build this how do you what</font>

492
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:59,230
is how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually configure this</font>

493
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:01,299
well it's pretty simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> really um</font>

494
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,370
there's a lot of machinery here but most

495
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:06,639
of it's pretty straightforward if you

496
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:09,879
want to enable the ITR the ipv4 listed

497
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:12,010
by TR you just say ipv4 IP list by TR

498
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,809
that for historical reasons the

499
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:19,980
implementation we're working on IP means

500
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:22,360
ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 means ipv6 surprisingly so</font>

501
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah so you just turn on like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that by</font>

502
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,879
saying I p less by TR and you got an ITR

503
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:30,700
um we put the flexibility in so you

504
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,419
could use another<font color="#E5E5E5"> for to resolve list</font>

505
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:36,010
mappings if you wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> but for now um</font>

506
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:38,110
we just tell it<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list of Earth</font>

507
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,730
we're calling Lisp and that's the one

508
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:43,809
that all the each<font color="#E5E5E5"> our subject</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

509
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:46,389
prefixes into early in the process and

510
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:51,158
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would this had a lot to do with the</font>

511
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:53,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk that thank you the what went on in</font>

512
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:56,320
the RG but basically there was a lot of

513
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,779
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you do when a packet</font>

514
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,309
hits an ITR and there's no mapping do

515
00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:04,299
you drop the package<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your queue it</font>

516
00:21:00,309 --> 00:21:06,610
what do you do and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did was we</font>

517
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:09,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well we don't know so what we'll</font>

518
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,678
do is we'll allow you to piggyback the

519
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,030
data on top of the map request or

520
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,610
underneath it actually

521
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,020
and send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over the data plane and we</font>

522
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,280
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling that data probe so</font>

523
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,470
basically what you would do is you just

524
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:23,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">D capsulate the packet at the EGR and</font>

525
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,840
send the data on to its destination even

526
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,480
though it was on the control plane and

527
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,409
not the data plane but we've kind of

528
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,940
deprecated that so when you get yours

529
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:36,940
don't turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on so now on the ETR</font>

530
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:39,190
side same thing turn it on EGR<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipg our</font>

531
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,800
list or ipv6 but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

532
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:43,600
interesting part remember I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said the ETR</font>

533
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,129
has to be a part a is authoritative for

534
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,080
some mapping so basically the way it

535
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:51,040
looks is the way we kind of work worked

536
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:52,510
on it for now is you say ipv6 or IP list

537
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,730
database mapping and then you give it an

538
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:56,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">eid prefix again in green and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our loke</font>

539
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,790
in red and then there are two other

540
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,300
parameters that you can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it priority</font>

541
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,889
in weight priority tells the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETR which</font>

542
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,690
ones to use first so if you have a

543
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,150
priority one and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> priority to mapping</font>

544
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,190
if the locator for the priority one

545
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,200
mapping is down it will use the priority

546
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:14,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one otherwise it leaves the one so</font>

547
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,030
higher is used first and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight is</font>

548
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,500
a percentage of the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's cut</font>

549
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:19,240
that goat that's going to that eid

550
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,260
prefix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be sent to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

551
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:26,350
look now<font color="#E5E5E5"> notice that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have to you</font>

552
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:28,060
could do load splitting and by telling

553
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,590
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty-fifty I'll show an example of</font>

554
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,450
that and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have to inject more</font>

555
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,699
specific prefixes to accomplish that in

556
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:36,160
fact you can do active active which is

557
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:38,500
pretty tough to do if not<font color="#E5E5E5"> impossible so</font>

558
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,860
this is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an instance this</font>

559
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,900
active active bgp free<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihoming is an</font>

560
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,610
instance of a side effect that we didn't

561
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,020
probably didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize when we first</font>

562
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:48,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">started designing us that we could do</font>

563
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:55,360
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have this additional level of</font>

564
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:57,910
indirection so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said earlier the ETR</font>

565
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,949
typically advertises a<font color="#CCCCCC"> HC ID prefix</font>

566
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever its authoritative for into the</font>

567
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,340
alt and that it attracts the map

568
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,660
requests right and then if you want to

569
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,970
do this mix locator thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was talking</font>

570
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before you could do it like this</font>

571
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:11,980
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what I have I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think on well I</font>

572
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,300
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you this and I'll then</font>

573
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,000
I'll tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you where this is basically</font>

574
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:20,440
what i say is i said okay i have this

575
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,770
prefix of / 48 1200 / 48 and the locator

576
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:28,510
for that on ipv4 is this

577
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:30,550
123 123 156 134 and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said use that one</font>

578
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:32,730
first right wait the priority one way

579
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,830
two hundred and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

580
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:37,840
but just do the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing only with</font>

581
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,330
ipv6 but don't use that one unless that

582
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,520
before one isn't there so what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

583
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:44,530
the effect of doing is when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I send a map</font>

584
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,500
reply a map request for this the ID

585
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,360
prefix I send it back over before<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

586
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,530
so are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do sent you can't send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

587
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,689
back over before and if you want to

588
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:55,810
force that to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can tell it by</font>

589
00:23:52,690 --> 00:24:00,970
saying ipv6 Lisp<font color="#CCCCCC"> EGR send it over IP</font>

590
00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:02,590
remember IP means ipv4 not ipv6 so we're

591
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:05,260
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of connect we can kind of</font>

592
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:06,490
do 4 / 6 / easily or we haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

593
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,900
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tried six over four but</font>

594
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:13,150
that ought to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> 24 / 6 works</font>

595
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:16,500
previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I wanted to show you</font>

596
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:19,600
this because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the</font>

597
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,420
typical ITR I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is mine would</font>

598
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,649
advertise<font color="#E5E5E5"> its the ID prefix I just</font>

599
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,100
happen to be using this technique of

600
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:28,930
putting a static route with a to null 0

601
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:31,719
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tag in it and then I then I</font>

602
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:34,420
just find that tag and stick a stick a

603
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:36,010
community on it so that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP can find</font>

604
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,990
it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real one that I thought was</font>

605
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,450
kind of interesting was so this one

606
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:44,080
where I have neighbor on birth lifts

607
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,580
neighbors FC 0 0 blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah so</font>

608
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,990
basically what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out is</font>

609
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:48,790
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we could use private</font>

610
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:49,960
addresses in different places<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the alt</font>

611
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,550
and what that would happen what would

612
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,440
happen and what was the significance of

613
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:55,270
those and basically it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> just as you</font>

614
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,820
might imagine it doesn't matter it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

615
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,260
works because the local the significance

616
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,100
of that address<font color="#CCCCCC"> is only between the two</font>

617
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:06,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">endpoints</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it seems to be pre robust</font>

618
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,110
to the addressing format there and then

619
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:11,530
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just standard bgp</font>

620
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:12,939
stuff as you guys know so we're trying

621
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">to we're trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

622
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,110
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to which is a lo op x</font>

623
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,240
version of all of this because at the

624
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,100
end of the day if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's cpe based it's</font>

625
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:24,280
got to be pretty cheap and<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to do so</font>

626
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:27,429
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this thing works is on the low</font>

627
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:29,590
optics xcr doesn't run bgp so what you

628
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:33,400
do is you put a static route to the

629
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:35,320
entire eid space both IP and visa

630
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,720
six to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side of the tunnel that</font>

631
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's what these first</font>

632
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,650
two lines are so just take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole /</font>

633
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,790
16 and send it right that's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

634
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:47,260
default route and then on the upstream

635
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:50,200
ultegra Gator just point point to

636
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:52,080
specific that this site 10 notes okay

637
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,250
the specific that this site is

638
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:56,649
authoritative for back down the tunnel

639
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,270
so that's how i did this and this is

640
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">just like you know you know when you</font>

641
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:05,800
have a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your static routing</font>

642
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,730
it's exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let me let</font>

643
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,230
me a blast through some of this because

644
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want you see how you guys</font>

645
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,980
think about these sites ok so this inner

646
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:15,100
this translate thing is inner working

647
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:16,180
right and basically here's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

648
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,740
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time left and I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

649
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,090
rip<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this but basically look at the</font>

650
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,920
middle bullet this is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I configured</font>

651
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,699
this thing I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the</font>

652
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:27,070
mapping and then on the let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

653
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,050
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the third line in the</font>

654
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:32,620
middle bullet it says IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> lists translate</font>

655
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:35,440
inside outside that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> nat right and</font>

656
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,760
then if you get on www translate list

657
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,710
for dotnet you can get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it right now</font>

658
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:43,600
that's an added list is translated right

659
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:48,040
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically i have three ways for you</font>

660
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:51,240
to get to that site nat PTR and ipv6 and

661
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,240
i'll show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so this is the first one</font>

662
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:57,910
so here's the PTR thing so it aggregates

663
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:00,670
the most coarsely aggregate able yagi

664
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,800
prefix into the into the DFC that causes

665
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:06,040
map that causes any package to the

666
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:07,300
lessee ID space to go to the PTR when it

667
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,670
gets that traffic it goes oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

668
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,500
illicit traffic it just behaves like an

669
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:13,300
ITR encapsulate sit you know does a

670
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,700
map-request encapsulates in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sense it</font>

671
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,560
to the other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the important</font>

672
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,610
thing is that the PTR doesn't really get

673
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,860
mapping state doesn't have any and so

674
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,990
how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do this well here you know</font>

675
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,669
it's like we worked a lot to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to</font>

676
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:30,040
work and but now it's all boiled down to

677
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:31,600
this here's the compiled version you

678
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,730
tell it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the list birth and then</font>

679
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,379
you tell it it's a proxy ITR so if you

680
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,400
get on you can get you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace</font>

681
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:38,560
rounding to either these would be

682
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:41,650
interesting to but basically if you get

683
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:43,500
on either either WWE for net that will

684
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:45,150
use the proxy

685
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:50,400
router that's at Andrew part Ann's house

686
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:53,220
because he's advertising 156 / 153 16 /

687
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,630
16 we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those up</font>

688
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,540
and running just for robustness and

689
00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:00,120
because the stretch involved is has to

690
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,879
do with how far the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoint is from nor</font>

691
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:07,590
the PTR is and then if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> wws</font>

692
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,810
net that's less that's ipv6 PTR that set

693
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,720
the you of all right now you'd be

694
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:17,730
surprised how hard it is to find ipv6

695
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:21,710
connectivity so we have some futures I

696
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:24,960
don't know how much time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have left 15</font>

697
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:27,180
12<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good um hopefully we'll take</font>

698
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,180
some questions because how this work

699
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,430
this all works<font color="#CCCCCC"> part crashed and burned</font>

700
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:33,990
so what we want to do in the future is

701
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:36,210
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of continue to develop</font>

702
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:38,640
less the software right I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean software</font>

703
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:40,650
base is always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a issue so we have nx-os</font>

704
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have iOS we have open lists going on</font>

705
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,960
um a couple of people have talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us</font>

706
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,400
about other implementations as well by

707
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,930
the way Lisp is a totally open thing

708
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,630
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a cisco thing we don't we're</font>

709
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:53,220
not taking my PR on it on everything

710
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,440
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have is published in the IETF</font>

711
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,030
who just we want we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we want to</font>

712
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,120
encourage people to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us and and</font>

713
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,639
you know contribute me and we want to

714
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:05,250
contribute back so the recent packet

715
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,690
format changes i mentioned on week and

716
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:08,160
that's in the new aspect that I think

717
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dina</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just published yesterday or the day</font>

718
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:12,030
before basically it's all about

719
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,040
piggybacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mapping the mapping on</font>

720
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,720
the map request because right if you're

721
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,950
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

722
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to talk to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you you're probably</font>

723
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,740
gonna want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me so i'll just</font>

724
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,120
send you my information when i said when

725
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,880
i send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you my request for your</font>

726
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,649
information i want to continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build</font>

727
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,670
out the network we have some new sites

728
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:31,110
level 3 in london's up Aaron I don't

729
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:33,120
know where their boxes it's in flight

730
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:35,669
somewhere I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay actually</font>

731
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,070
got his for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Uruguay did you get it or</font>

732
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,140
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or shipping stuff to Uruguay</font>

733
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:42,240
is interesting and then there's several

734
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,320
other ones in flight but let us know if

735
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,610
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested where I was looking</font>

736
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,770
for new sites and new<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to work</font>

737
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:49,699
with one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things we really want to</font>

738
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:53,400
do is simplify the Alton how it works

739
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,440
some open questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay who runs the</font>

740
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,610
mapping system right

741
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,190
and what's the business model for

742
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:00,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">whoever runs it our kind of idea was</font>

743
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,580
maybe it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be natural to have the rirs</font>

744
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,870
run it and that's why we're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

745
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:04,759
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved with ripe and Erin and all</font>

746
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and and all this kind of stuff but</font>

747
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:09,830
you know those are still open questions

748
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,929
it's the mapping system too complicated

749
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,580
its complexity issues I'm most really

750
00:30:11,929 --> 00:30:16,399
sensitive that so I I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of always</font>

751
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,379
look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go not sure negative</font>

752
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,258
map replies that's an interesting one so

753
00:30:18,379 --> 00:30:24,230
you're an ITR you're sending a map

754
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:25,870
request for a piece of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eid space</font>

755
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,330
that doesn't exist there's nobody there

756
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:31,189
how do you know to stop sending them so

757
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:33,408
what we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do was in the alt</font>

758
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,700
route<font color="#CCCCCC"> er the all routers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

759
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:36,710
router right now it doesn't know

760
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,059
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Liz and that was kind of</font>

761
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,409
a feature we liked it because you know

762
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:41,360
you could use a zebra box or a<font color="#E5E5E5"> crocodile</font>

763
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:43,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">or anything or any other blocks in there</font>

764
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,070
to run that right if it needs to return

765
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,600
negative map<font color="#E5E5E5"> replies then maybe it's not</font>

766
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,830
going to be able to be a generic BGP

767
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,678
speaker and we're trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> avoid that</font>

768
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">and think of ways to accomplish this by</font>

769
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,379
you know sending back coarse aggregates

770
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:00,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the that the ITR could you could</font>

771
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:03,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">know were not there that's a tricky</font>

772
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,559
though there's some ideas about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

773
00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:08,559
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists for ipv4 address space</font>

774
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:10,700
conservation on you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be seeing that in</font>

775
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,549
internet draft format I hope pretty

776
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,720
quickly there's issues about what is the

777
00:31:13,549 --> 00:31:17,120
effect of the mapping system on

778
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,409
applications in particular you know if

779
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,610
you have to drop the first packet

780
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:21,500
because you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mapping or</font>

781
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:24,769
what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the latency induced by just</font>

782
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:26,570
doing the lookup there's other issues

783
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:28,309
about the scalability of the alt what

784
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,279
happens if it degenerates into what we

785
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:35,509
have in the DFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp right now if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

786
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:37,940
anything path MTU effects you're putting

787
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:41,210
another header on the packet are you are

788
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">you blowing up the MTU too much stretch</font>

789
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:45,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">affects how much how much long path</font>

790
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:47,629
routing is going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on here how about</font>

791
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:49,070
caching and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ex</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TRS there's you know</font>

792
00:31:47,629 --> 00:31:50,090
there's the point of this slide is that

793
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,418
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of stuff to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font>

794
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:52,418
here

795
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:58,579
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet drafts that are out</font>

796
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:01,609
there the top one is the base spec the

797
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:03,229
middle the draft fuller excuse me that's

798
00:32:01,609 --> 00:32:06,049
the alt spec it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight for</font>

799
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:08,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's easy to read the interworking</font>

800
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:11,359
expect is this draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> louis one and then</font>

801
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:12,529
i wrote this thing it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really kind of a</font>

802
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,958
trying to put a stake in the ground

803
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:17,449
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> i need any ID prefix allocated by</font>

804
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:19,159
the ayana that's what draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> my list each</font>

805
00:32:17,449 --> 00:32:20,389
ID block is but really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i went out and</font>

806
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,269
bought one because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i couldn't get him to</font>

807
00:32:20,389 --> 00:32:24,799
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me one so so i got extent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got 500</font>

808
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:26,599
bucks extorted from me from errands so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

809
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:33,469
could use the slicer EG apparently

810
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:35,629
they're rare or scarce and then Luigi

811
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:37,579
and his crew<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brussels have this open</font>

812
00:32:35,629 --> 00:32:38,629
with some implementation in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

813
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:40,908
have a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of an interesting</font>

814
00:32:38,629 --> 00:32:42,708
idea about how to use DHT as a mapping

815
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:45,919
system to although<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not well cooked</font>

816
00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:48,409
it's shown there and then these ones in

817
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,759
red or some other things we tried when

818
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:50,749
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the early days when we were</font>

819
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:56,209
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about different kinds of</font>

820
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:58,569
mapping systems so that's about it get

821
00:32:56,209 --> 00:33:02,019
on the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> for net or list of six net</font>

822
00:32:58,569 --> 00:33:02,019
to see what you think

823
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:12,070
and then deserve again I wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite</font>

824
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:15,070
sure when I looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint</font>

825
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:18,100
identifier idea and you're concerned

826
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:19,750
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> not having a big flat cable how</font>

827
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,428
are you thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobility and</font>

828
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:23,740
people moving from one part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

829
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:26,169
to another trying to carry the VIP with

830
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:31,269
them is there anything there are we

831
00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:33,669
thinking fix information well so

832
00:33:31,269 --> 00:33:35,580
mobility yeah I should have mentioned

833
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:38,140
mobility as one of the open questions um

834
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,870
we had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas about mobility one</font>

835
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:43,539
is you could rehome because you're

836
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,299
topologically disconnected so you could

837
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:47,740
keep the old aggregated that way but you

838
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:49,990
cannot there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of other ideas</font>

839
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,600
with thought about which which include

840
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:56,019
like making the ITR notice that you've

841
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,309
moved and trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

842
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:00,100
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you don't inject that</font>

843
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:01,779
into the injector longer prefix into the

844
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:03,129
into the alt because if you do that I

845
00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:05,320
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> your question is if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

846
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:07,210
mobility and receive this is what your

847
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,469
great timing if you have mobility it's

848
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:10,720
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fragment the address space</font>

849
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:16,719
like it is today right and that's what

850
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:21,299
we're trying to avoid talking so let's

851
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:25,629
appreciate the beautiful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and reduces um</font>

852
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,950
the little chrome hasn't although i

853
00:34:25,629 --> 00:34:30,279
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's named a certain amount of</font>

854
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:32,949
buzz it's also getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> any maybe not in</font>

855
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,859
public but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i hear a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of fairly</font>

856
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:37,330
widespread private connection about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

857
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:39,360
and some of that's just sort of

858
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:42,210
free-floating kvetching about math and

859
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:44,040
general and people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is it's</font>

860
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:45,810
either confusion<font color="#E5E5E5"> or that or we try two</font>

861
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,340
years ago needs it work<font color="#CCCCCC"> but there's a</font>

862
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,170
lot of so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

863
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:52,560
lay out what you think are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

864
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:55,020
common objections to us that you've

865
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:02,360
heard and just line them up and knock

866
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:02,360
them down well that's an easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

867
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:12,960
yeah yeah yeah um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let me do a few</font>

868
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,129
of them and can I ask the restless crew

869
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,260
because they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get up here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and think</font>

870
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,360
of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> too while i'm thinking so if</font>

871
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:24,150
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have an idea you</font>

872
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:25,860
want to I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> give a couple one one thing</font>

873
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:27,720
I've heard from a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and I've</font>

874
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,410
heard this in various contexts is that

875
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,180
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lisp intense tit</font>

876
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:36,560
you know intends to extend the life of

877
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,339
ipv4 and help it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale as and</font>

878
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,779
anything one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've heard is that</font>

879
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:45,270
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do to you know try to shore</font>

880
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,070
up by PB for is really damaging to ipv6

881
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:49,140
deployment I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> that from a lot of</font>

882
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:51,090
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really buy that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

883
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,580
so I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know I that seems</font>

884
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:55,470
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an opinion and not a technical</font>

885
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:57,509
complained to me that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

886
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think I mentioned two paths em to you</font>

887
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,890
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> people you know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact there were</font>

888
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:04,319
some complicated specs that came out

889
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:06,270
about how to do this path MTU stuff and

890
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,800
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we decided to do was you</font>

891
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,570
know something really simple like if you

892
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,030
have a packet that goes over a certain

893
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,350
size break it in half you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know rather</font>

894
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:14,790
than to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of protocol</font>

895
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:17,220
machinery in there to solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

896
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,020
that may or may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be a problem a lot</font>

897
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,649
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have said that the alt is too</font>

898
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:24,270
complicated or that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Eid prefix</font>

899
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:26,340
allocation could never happen the way we

900
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:29,400
were envisioning it these kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

901
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,380
and those are legitimate concerns but as

902
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,820
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier on one of the</font>

903
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,800
reasons we've done this the way we have

904
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">is because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we wanted to get deployment</font>

905
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,790
experience rather than you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

906
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:41,250
Gedanken experiment or whatever so you

907
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:44,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">know those were those were issues do you</font>

908
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:46,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">know do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have something I was</font>

909
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,920
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> he said this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is entirely for</font>

910
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,710
that hasn't been successful so around

911
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,960
for a long time been around for a long

912
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,430
time and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only really good dollars</font>

913
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,200
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the house this is the first time</font>

914
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,240
it's actually we've done in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

915
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,000
we don't have to change notes and very

916
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:06,379
much you know when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font>

917
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement a solution and ipv4 scritti</font>

much ass<font color="#CCCCCC"> monica prefixes and try to</font>

919
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,960
investment and you can think you didn't

920
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,960
do this much better like 86 because

921
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,490
things like is a destination<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

922
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,010
capable or not we just look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

923
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,290
prefix a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard-coded where all the</font>

00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,820
prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give you four uses out</font>

925
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:25,160
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ids would have to be put a really</font>

926
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:27,800
large table so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to put mechanism</font>

927
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:30,549
in the network that's open so in a

928
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,090
nutshell<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the first network based</font>

locator understood

930
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:41,150
others

931
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:44,799
okay well thank you
