okay thanks Ted next up is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Larry Roberts</font>

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:15,000
from anagram here's a long history and

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:17,789
the helping build<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and he's</font>

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,198
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about IP fairness changing</font>

00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the IP fairness rule with flow</font>

7
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:39,030
thank you very much welcome everybody

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:42,760
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very concerned about the future with</font>

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">one flaw we've we've migrated into the</font>

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet it's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't there when</font>

11
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:50,828
we started and it's it's turned into one

12
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:54,970
that's fairly severe and one that we

13
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:56,829
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take some concern over the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:59,710
start though back at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning and</font>

15
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:02,859
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet got started</font>

16
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:05,410
and where this came from I started

17
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:07,810
experiments in 65 between two computers

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:10,030
to try and make sure what we needed and

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,550
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed a new network so then they</font>

20
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:17,920
drafted me into ARPA to build a network

21
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:22,780
in 67 and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> then showed you earlier it</font>

22
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:26,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">had built with four nodes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 69 and we</font>

23
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:30,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">grew that through 1971 until I left in</font>

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:34,959
73 the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really large and was</font>

25
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,179
doing very very well as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a packet</font>

26
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:43,149
network demonstrating the economic

27
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:47,830
viability Bob Kahn succeeded me in the

28
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:50,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">office and took over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 73 and Vint Cerf</font>

29
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:53,410
was hired by him shortly thereafter and

30
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:59,649
they worked on the tcp/ip<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol and</font>

31
00:01:53,410 --> 00:02:01,690
put that established in 1983 and in 1986

32
00:01:59,649 --> 00:02:07,750
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEF took over the network and by</font>

33
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:09,489
1991 it was commercially operable so

34
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,770
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the growth of the network</font>

35
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:16,540
throughout that period it was it was

36
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing relatively slowly during the</font>

37
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,179
early<font color="#E5E5E5"> period before we got a final</font>

protocol established<font color="#CCCCCC"> ello TCP was under</font>

39
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:28,060
design most of that time it got

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,519
incorporated fully and 83 and network

41
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,480
grew pretty rapidly back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font>

42
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,410
period been in 71 lots of things happen

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,560
because we had the

44
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:41,900
Aloha packet radio and I then developed

45
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,150
the slotted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aloha which is now used for</font>

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,810
the Wi-Fi and of course was used in the

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:51,470
packet radio net and also designed the

48
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:53,540
protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the satellite network we</font>

49
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,820
did a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:03:00,250
ethernet was invented during that period

51
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:02,500
and many many different technological

52
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:05,200
improvements occurred in packet

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,000
technology and<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very condensed period</font>

54
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,760
at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing started you know</font>

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,190
getting refined and built up in the

00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,820
traffic's that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing as TCP bucket</font>

57
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:21,440
introduced<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning then we had</font>

58
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:24,290
basically a single flow per person in

59
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,600
other words voice which was our main

60
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,489
heritage at that time was a flow per

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,769
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we expected voice on the</font>

00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,420
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> Danny Cohen did a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:36,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and prove</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

64
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,630
quite viable and we were certainly

65
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,560
considering that was one option in one

66
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:45,470
use we had at that time<font color="#E5E5E5"> only terminal</font>

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">two computer activity in large part that</font>

68
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,700
was designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow computers to talk</font>

69
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:52,100
with each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other but almost always it was</font>

70
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,290
one process talking to another but

71
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,840
mostly it was users in remote locations

72
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,359
talking to one computer or another over

73
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,300
the network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was one flow per user</font>

74
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">and instruction so as a result we sort</font>

75
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of equated users with flows and as the</font>

76
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,590
design never really was looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

77
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:15,950
fairness as an absolute<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue we knew</font>

78
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:19,160
users we should be equal and thus as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

79
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:20,988
came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you had equal capacity per</font>

flower that was fine under congestion

81
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:28,880
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the concept that we allowed to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">occur and it worked very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well everybody</font>

83
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,900
got equal use of the network now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

the overall graph of the growth<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kept</font>

86
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,360
measured it very

87
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">way around 2000 2001 to see what was</font>

88
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,889
happening by pulling<font color="#E5E5E5"> them all of the</font>

89
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:53,470
core ISPs and and found out<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much of</font>

90
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,910
the grown and similarly people have

91
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,880
published statistics all over the world

92
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:01,000
since then and we have a fair idea of

93
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:04,180
what's happening over all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the same</font>

94
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,400
period from 1999 on we've had PDP

95
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,680
getting introduced and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's consumed</font>

96
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:14,560
more and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the network capacity</font>

97
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:16,210
and that that is measured pretty

98
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,220
accurately by many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people during the</font>

99
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:21,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier periods up until a few years ago</font>

100
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,870
and recently those estimates<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

101
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:26,050
declining but that's because I believe

102
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:29,020
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't find all the p2p the normal</font>

103
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:31,630
traffic at the moment is about a growth

104
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:34,630
of 22 / years since the beginning of the

105
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:36,610
network so that is the overall growth

106
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:38,949
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower at the moment by quite a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

107
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:40,900
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itself is only growing at</font>

108
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:44,200
Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Law at the moment because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber</font>

109
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:48,789
is pretty makes communications capacity

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:50,770
pretty cheap and the the electronic

111
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:53,409
equipment is the main cost and therefore

112
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,639
as electronics kits cheaper you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can keep</font>

113
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,740
the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

114
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,280
pretty constant you're just adding edge

115
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,960
nodes and so the cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network is</font>

116
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,510
being constrained at the moment

117
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,340
partially because the normal users pay

118
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:11,139
the bills and and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not growing</font>

119
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:13,780
much at all so where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we now well the</font>

120
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:15,610
internet is still equal capacity for

121
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,349
flow under congestion they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all</font>

122
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,270
exactly equal they're all over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> place</font>

123
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:23,200
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> average the same over a period</font>

124
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:25,270
of time so that they may stall and they

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,139
may grow back and they may grow back

126
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:28,909
larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> than anyone else</font>

127
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:32,689
and then they may stall again and then

128
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:35,539
they may grow back so<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well they're</font>

129
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:37,729
averaging about the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate the</font>

130
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:41,449
computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are generating the flows not</font>

131
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:43,310
the users though so as a user logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

132
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:47,990
an application runs an application

whether it's HTTP or ftp or p2p he runs

134
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,039
that application application does what

135
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:56,080
it thinks is best in terms of the

136
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:58,969
process HTTP does tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use many flows</font>

137

for the different parts of the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

not too many p 2 p uses many flows and

00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,979
is talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many locations getting</font>

a lot of flows but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't at the</font>

144
00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:18,049
moment we've actually tested that in

145
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:20,740
some government experiments that have

146
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:25,639
gone on and that tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work as well</font>

147
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,620
to generate more capacity per user so in

148
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,159
fact if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do generate more flows you</font>

149
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:33,560
get more capacity and that is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

150
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,240
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network because you may have paid</font>

151
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,419
the same amount as your<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbor but you</font>

152
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,849
can get vastly more capacity than your

153
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:45,020
neighbor<font color="#CCCCCC"> or your associate in the</font>

154
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:47,839
company or university the congestion

155
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:49,818
usually typically occurs at the edge so

156
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,310
that this is usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening at a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pooled point where he is cooling common</font>

158
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,349
path capacity it's not at your modem

159
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,229
necessarily you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some pooling at</font>

160
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:02,479
your house but it's mainly happening at

161
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,818
a congestion point where the network

162
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:09,370
enters the thin line going<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

internet or this in line going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

166
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,479
congestion at these points because

167
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:22,938
that's its goal to keep on expanding it

168
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,650
can't expand generally past the delay

169
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:27,160
limit

170
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:29,590
depends on how far that's going and and

171
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,050
what loss it occurred what loss it sees

172
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,110
but it will can generally be able to

173
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:37,959
expand to 20 megabytes in reasonably

174
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:40,390
short distances and therefore you can

175
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,909
you can fill up the link pretty quickly

176
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:45,600
with TCP flows if there are just a

177
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:49,000
handful of look Amanda few hundred flows

178
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,890
that that forces<font color="#CCCCCC"> the equal capacity per</font>

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,300

183
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,600
happening and you're still causing the

184
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:06,730
equal capacity for flow and then then in

185
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:11,020
fact everybody gets about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

186

who paid the same gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things</font>

thousand users but actually since the

00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,529
average is more like 100 kilobytes per

197

199
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:46,870
it's in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> range depending on the</font>

200
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,430

bandwidth going into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in</font>

there's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> about half a percent to a</font>

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,760
percent PDP users they can use up all

206
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:02,890
that bandwidth because they can generate

207
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,890
enough flows to do that and that will in

208
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:08,529
fact they'll interfere with themselves

209
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:12,040
if there's more p2p users than that so

210
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:15,339
anything above a percent or so will just

211
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,860
be an excess of p2p and they'll be

212
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:19,930
competing with themselves but they'll

213
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,300
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> given all the standard users</font>

214

way down in there

data rates this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see the</font>

exchange more effectively as i said in

219
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:38,910
recent years people have been measuring

220
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:40,589
it and some of the DPI vendors have been

221
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,920
reporting well it's down to thirty or

222
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:46,140
forty percent p2p that's what they see

223
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:50,370
but they but in reality there's a huge

224

<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of unknown tcp and unknown UDP</font>

225
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,709
that if you count it shows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

226
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:58,800
still running about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty percent p2p</font>

227
00:10:55,709 --> 00:11:00,810
and the normal traffic is down at

gets finished so that it can get the

effectively getting the same capacity as

304

everybody else but it can't overload

world ISPs in every country that this is

309

so bad they make a lot of business in

<font color="#E5E5E5">what happens for the downstream path in</font>

same amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> in each direction so it's</font>

except for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xtreme solicitors users</font>

332
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:44,690

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the downstream but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ACT streams of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average users are running so slow</font>

335
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,660
that they get slowed down with their

336
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:54,020

338
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,410
and so you're now wasting twenty percent

339
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:03,110
of the capacity it gets worse if the

340
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,350
asymmetry is higher so the the problem

341
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,170
is that asymmetric operation actually is

342
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:12,710
better than symmetric for giving people

343
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:14,870
more downstream capacity but it it

344
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:17,900
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> waist capacity as well and</font>

this can cause a major collapse of

at the expense of others p2p started to

do this and it's up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand</font>

other applications<font color="#CCCCCC"> will do the same ftp</font>

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:15,699
hard to then control their rate to a

427
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,340
different rate if they're using<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

428
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,549
than somebody else so today's technology

429
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">really allows for us to do this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

430
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:29,200
have at the choke points the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to</font>

431
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:32,529
manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiflo and any other inequity</font>

432
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,130
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep the multiple flows the</font>

433
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:38,590
same bandwidth is the single flow and so

434
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,760
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets the same capacity to the</font>

435
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:45,580
network this is not that difficult to

436
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,940
achieve and is something which I really

437
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,799
believe we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work towards and why</font>

438
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,769
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it important well it's an attractive</font>

439
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,260
application it can't determine a fair

440
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:59,289
share itself and the network must

441
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,720
provide the boundary now<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiflo</font>

442
00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:03,639
applications are misled on economics

443
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,049
I've talked to lots of people now who

444
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:07,209
are building<font color="#CCCCCC"> new applications they say</font>

445
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,580
oh I'm going use p2p because it's a

446
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,679
cheaper way to deliver software to or

447
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,529
super way to deliver movies or whatever

448
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,740
to my customers and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

449
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:21,130
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's hurting everybody else and</font>

450
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,860
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there economics are badly misjudged</font>

451
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:26,889
the cost of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the community is</font>

452
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:30,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">very high the cost of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last link is</font>

453
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:32,979
much higher than the cost of the server

454
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,010
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> core of the network which is</font>

455
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:38,049
connected to 10 gig things in fact

456
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:39,519
probably about 20 times higher to get it

457
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:42,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">from your neighbor than to get it from a</font>

458
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:46,600
server on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core so it's it's really</font>

459
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:50,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">an unequivocal one that looks attractive</font>

460
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,049
now because the ISPs haven't put in this

461
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:54,879
kind of new fairness once they do then

462
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:57,370
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> will go to an economic</font>

463
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">structure and use what's most effective</font>

464
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:03,939
and new users won't do things which are

465
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:07,510
ineffective<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just monitor it</font>

466
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,930
we can just look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one technique</font>

467
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:11,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we</font>

468
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:13,520
using is to just watch for how many

469
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:16,610
flows and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much traffic is there and</font>

470
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,160
and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this persists for unusual</font>

471
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:23,300
periods and you can very quickly detect

472
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,930
net flow I mean net detect the p2p users

473
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:30,260
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiflow users of any kind and</font>

474
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:32,510
you can then send net flow records out

475
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:36,320
for each of those flows and record those

476
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:38,300
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know every p2p transaction</font>

477
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,460
occurred and you can record those

478
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiently and those records</font>

479
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:44,540
can be stored for any period if you want

480
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,690
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to look back and see what</font>

481
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:50,060
happened in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all multiflow users</font>

482
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:51,590
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be clearly listed in a net flow</font>

483
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,300
collector you can find out who<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

484
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:56,360
and you can do what you want to control

485
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:59,149
the abuse but it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me much more</font>

486
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective to actually introduce fairness</font>

487
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:02,600
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people move in the right</font>

488
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,770
direction automatically rather than

489
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:11,000
having to be disciplined so in summary

490
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:14,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> across is that p2p</font>

491
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,330
today adds flows until congestion occurs

492
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,939
and even if you reduce them to half a

493
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:22,899
percent from five percent with very

494
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,650
efficient mechanisms it still will

495
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:29,270
ingest the upstream to capacity and

496
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,550
everybody will suffer the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average user</font>

497
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:34,340
suffers a major throughput reduction

498
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:36,889
this will get worse as many more

499
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,540
applications use this and in fact as I

500
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:41,030
said we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> already developed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

501
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,860
capability<font color="#E5E5E5"> and DARPA with a DARPA</font>

502
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:46,129
program to do this for other

503
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:49,070
applications and this will continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

504
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:52,730
happen if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't change the mechanism</font>

505
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:56,060
and try to guarantee that people get

506
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,180
equal capacity for equal pay rather than

507
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,679
equal capacity<font color="#E5E5E5"> per flow then users get</font>

508
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,000
what they pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ninety-five</font>

509
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,610
percent of the users will see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a major</font>

510
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,410
throughput<font color="#CCCCCC"> gain in fact probably ninety</font>

511
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,449
nine percent because a lot of those

512
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:11,800
current PDP users are being constrained

513
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:14,890
by dpi so everybody pretty

514
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:17,379
we'll win and get what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay for on</font>

515
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:20,860
the network this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen over time</font>

516
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:24,820
or we're not going to to survive because

517
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:27,520
as this happens we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use up</font>

518
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of the all of the ports in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">now Don and net will fail we can't keep</font>

522
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:39,250
won't work in the long run so we can't

523
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:41,550
let this run out of hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let the</font>

524
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:44,310
arms race go we have to stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it somehow</font>

525
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:47,110
so I really want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a major</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everybody's got to help do this</font>

530
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:13,110
just in question there's a quick

531
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:15,330
question are any attributions available

532
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,639
for the graphs that you presented what

533
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,750
was the source for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that material de</font>

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,000
specifically the the traffic growth

graphs the percentage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> traveling this</font>

536
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,360
peer-to-peer that kind of stuff the the

537
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:31,189
that's a long process of collecting data

538
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,449
that I've undertaken over time

539
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,250
throughout the period of time the

540
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,940
network was in the government's hands I

541
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:42,179
collected that data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in</font>

542
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,919
2000-2001<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hold every ISP under NDA</font>

543
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:47,370
because they wouldn't they wouldn't

544
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,679
release it publicly and so I got a clean

545
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:52,709
set of data points<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic in</font>

547
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:58,530
hasn't reported very well but most other

548
00:25:54,659 --> 00:26:01,770
countries have and I slowly adjusted the

<font color="#E5E5E5">u.s. percentage based on the changes</font>

550
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:06,480
that I've seen and the numbers that I've

seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall the PDP percentages have</font>

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,020
various points in time and it from 99 on

554
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,960
through now and so I've been collecting

555
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,389
those measurements and looking at the

556
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,169
fraction of p2p the latest ones are

557
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,720
based on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> own hypothesis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the French</font>

560
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,939
that's fairly accurate but you can't be

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:08,000

570
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,250
everything it would probably was based

571
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,600
on how many hosts<font color="#CCCCCC"> you expect it to him</font>

572
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:16,460
in some future well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't I can't</font>

573
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,679
change the numbers those are the ones

574
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,390
collected so it may have been inaccurate

575
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,160
during that period but it's not

576
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,340
particularly that the traffic was

577
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:29,740
measured as well so I can't fix it Danny

578
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:32,540
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about it later thank you i</font>

579
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:36,200
enjoyed hearing your presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on i'm</font>

583
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,750
think what you've said here today tells

me it encourages<font color="#E5E5E5"> me actually in the</font>

594
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,100
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and more than first and</font>

595
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:14,030
first down would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a really good step</font>

596
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,300
from a vendor's point of view I think

597
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:18,920
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what you're saying here</font>

598
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:22,250
maybe you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> agree or disagree I'm</font>

599
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,780
curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that supports it yes I</font>

600
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:27,110
that's the way I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

601
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:29,149
control individual flows and that's the

602
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,399
right way to approach the problem rather

603
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:35,090
than discarding from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> first-in</font>

604
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:42,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">first-out q that's sort of a very random</font>

605
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:43,928
way to control the network thank you hi

606
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,700
Patrick no more<font color="#E5E5E5"> from walk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

607
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:47,049
first I'd like to say that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

608
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,840
good presentation and I think that

609
00:28:47,049 --> 00:28:51,309
everyone here<font color="#E5E5E5"> agrees that doing maybe</font>

610
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,709
eventually everyone agrees but I think

611
00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:55,240
it's a good idea to do it per user but I

612
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,710
had some questions you were saying I

613
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,080
mean on this slide you're saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

614
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,210
point five percent of the total users

615
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,279
can catch us up stream capacity and we

616
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,159
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you talked about a six</font>

00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:08,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">meg down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through makeup network that one</font>

618
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,929
is that the upstream which is half of

619
00:29:08,259 --> 00:29:12,279
the downstream the network which in the

620
00:29:10,929 --> 00:29:13,570
core<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the peering is going to be</font>

621
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:16,679
perfectly symmetrical does not have a

622
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,240
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five percent available capacity</font>

623
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,860
because half of point five percent you

624
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:22,690
know the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> mate versus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the six meg</font>

625
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,490
would make it point<font color="#E5E5E5"> to five percent of</font>

626
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,950
the total capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> if point two five</font>

627
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:28,899
percent of users using the system can

628
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,179
congest the upstream capacity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

629
00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:32,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's a problem with the basic</font>

630
00:29:31,179 --> 00:29:34,480
core design of the network to begin with

631
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,240
because even without p2p you're going to

632
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,619
run into problems so and earlier in the

633
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,600
presentation we're saying five percent

634
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:43,658
of users are using p2p<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just</font>

635
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering if you know we already do do</font>

636
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,960
some rate limiting per user it's called

637
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:49,509
the physical connection down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dsl</font>

638
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">line or the cable modem if that's set up</font>

639
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:53,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">for only three megs upstream and that is</font>

640
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,669
really being physically rate limited

641
00:29:53,019 --> 00:29:57,369
because that's the clock speed on the

642
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:59,320
piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you be able</font>

643
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:01,418
shouldn't a normal network be able to

644
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,189
support you know two and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> half percent</font>

645
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:04,360
of their users actually using demand

646
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,860
with that they've given them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

647
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,168
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sounds reasonable to</font>

648
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,709
me but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm wondering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

649
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:13,059
Oh point two five percent of total user

650
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:16,210
capacity can congest the upstream well

651
00:30:13,059 --> 00:30:18,369
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are sending</font>

652
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">and receiving at the same time they</font>

653
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:23,168
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be but they can be and</font>

654
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:25,480
that's inclusive half a percent but one

655
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the very to yes perhaps a particular</font>

656
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,980
slide should have been talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about one</font>

657
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:36,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent because of the limit of the bin</font>

658
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:39,460
but that was there but but some of the

659
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,049
some of the cases I've seen and most of

660
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,899
the cases I've seen it's around half a

661
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,370
percent so I used a half a percent sort

662
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:48,399
of widely

663
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:51,429
the thousand user case because that's

664
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:53,559
what we tend to see it depends exactly

665
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:55,840
how bit how you been with this

666
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:58,180
distributed and how how big your pipe is

667
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,699
whether that's half a percent or<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

668
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:06,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent it very high I guess I'm just</font>

669
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:08,080
not disagreeing with the concept I guess

670
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm just saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if if I were</font>

congested it I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that my network</font>

674
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:20,710
wasn't done right no<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's if if 10 users</font>

675
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,750
out of those those are using 10 megabits

676
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,510
you've just used up virtually all your

677
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:28,179
capacity you don't have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> more but</font>

678
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:30,100
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what you were I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

679
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:32,140
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the knee but that's what I</font>

680
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's good but that's not what you said</font>

681
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:37,210
earlier in the presentation and you have

682
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,580
a much smaller user / much smaller

683
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:41,020
megabits per user but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> right if</font>

684
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user has a gigabit than obviously</font>

685
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,670
ever problem learn have a gigabit they

686
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:50,949
they may have 10 megabits or a hundred

687
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:53,370
bag of it but question over here to the

688
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,510
side yeah sprung the bottom of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BBC</font>

689
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,600
adoption of the peer-to-peer was more

focus on just making the pipes bigger it

709
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:50,740
still strikes me that here in the US we

710
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:53,020
need much much bigger pipes and by

711
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,120
focusing instead on the queueing

712

discipline aren't we you know trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

say okay we have enough been with plenty

00:32:58,929 --> 00:33:01,299
using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> more efficiently instead of</font>

717
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:07,360
much much bigger pipes well it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

718

that if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP expands the pipe he gets</font>

719
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,469
hurt much worse that's what i was

720
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:13,870
showing in one of the graphs it goes

721
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:16,960
from eighty to ninety nine percent it

722
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:20,559
gets worse because the p2p user can use

723
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,770
more bandwidth and they're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

724
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:26,139
it symmetrically it doesn't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

725
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:28,179
problem if you expand the beverage with

the people the lava flows will win still

727
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:33,850
and you can't expand the bandwidth as

728
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:36,039
much as you might think to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred</font>

729
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:38,740
percent because the court of the network

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't support it we have ten</font>

734
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:53,320
economically in this day and age oh the

735
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,630
extension of network is happening every

736
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:57,399
day as I say it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> currently going at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Moore's law as fast as people can build</font>

the core just<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a certain limit in</font>

742
00:34:07,419 --> 00:34:13,750
terms of investment especially at

743
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,179
today's prices and I would take more

744
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:17,830
let's do a couple other questions one

745
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,869
down here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:21,340
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have is in this model how do</font>

747
00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:23,659
you define a user's that by an IP

748
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,089
address because there could be multiple

749
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:27,319
behind a noun firewall which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

750
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:29,949
the majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network is spaced</font>

751
00:34:27,319 --> 00:34:33,079
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way today who and who are you with</font>

752
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:35,359
Jeff Turner with inner stream thanks i

753
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:37,819
am defining it as an IP address because

754
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:43,489
that's what the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that bandwidth</font>

755
00:34:37,819 --> 00:34:45,799
is being sold to so it's the the /

756
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:48,348
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the only thing we have a</font>

757
00:34:45,799 --> 00:34:53,329
contract with and that's the one who

758
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:55,730
bought the bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi ho mark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Petrus</font>

759
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:58,099
nominal I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> understand what</font>

760
00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:00,710
equal capacity for equal pay means if I

761
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:02,329
have to users in two adjacent houses on

762
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:05,089
the same network and all like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

763
00:35:02,329 --> 00:35:07,099
one's going you know one hop away to

764
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:09,049
another neighbor and goes as fast as he

765
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:12,380
can and others going<font color="#E5E5E5"> five hops away to</font>

766
00:35:09,049 --> 00:35:14,349
Europe how do I know when they're

767
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:17,150
getting equal capacity for equal pay

768
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:22,309
well the congestion point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really at</font>

769
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:24,920
the ISPs d am or PM TS or whatever

770
00:35:22,309 --> 00:35:27,619
device is using at that point and that

771
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:30,380
point knows what everybody is using and

772
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:33,410
or it can be measured at that point or

773
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,809
just adjacent to it and you can you can

774
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:37,578
see what everybody is using now he's

775
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,839
going a long distance you may not be

776
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:40,339
getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same bandwidth there's</font>

777
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:43,460
somebody going a short distance but you

778
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:45,680
can also compensate for that so you're

779
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,650
sort of saying equal capacity for equal

780
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,058
pay in the local loop right both people

781
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:51,579
are paying the same amount they should

782
00:35:50,059 --> 00:35:54,079
both be able to get the same capacity

783
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:55,579
there made<font color="#CCCCCC"> me some inequities where they</font>

784
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,140
can't do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it like if</font>

785
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:59,539
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to go through a satellite</font>

786
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,788
hop they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just may not get the same</font>

787
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:03,319
capacity as anybody else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's is</font>

788
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:06,890
it because if they were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

789
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:08,599
thing they would unfortunately I think

790
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">we got to get moving to the next one if</font>

791
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:12,170
and we have a break<font color="#E5E5E5"> right after this</font>

792
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,079
talk so why don't you find I'm gonna get

793
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:18,099
you next time dr. Roberts<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the break</font>

794
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:18,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks done thank you</font>
