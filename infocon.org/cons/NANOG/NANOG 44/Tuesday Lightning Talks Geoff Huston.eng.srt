00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,540
lastly lightning talk this morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:08,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">be by Jeff Houston AP neck</font>

3
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,640
it's not

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,720
good morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes right or seven</font>

5
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about how well we're</font>

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,769
doing with ipv6 and this is work that

7
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,860
I've done with George<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michael son of a</font>

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">painting so in trying to measure how</font>

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,100
much ipv6 is out there the problem is

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,720
that all you folk don't share<font color="#CCCCCC"> your data</font>

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,280
you keep on saying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dirty</font>

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,960
secrets of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your dirty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> secrets and I</font>

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,180
can't have a look at it which is a bit

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,650
of a bummer so I actually can't tell you

15
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,540
how many packets are flowing through

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:04,369
your networks that are ipv6 flavored

17
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,070
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to that data</font>

18
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:10,070
but what I do have access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is some BGP</font>

19
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,770
routing tables some dns logs and some

20
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,809
web servers and all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> datasets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,940
back over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last four years because</font>

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,280
what I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand is after</font>

23
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,100
about 50 million slide presentations and

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,600
all about you know 500 man years of you

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,089
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting here listening to how big</font>

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,699
and wonderful ipv6 is have you done

27
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything so let's find out how well</font>

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,570
you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these things</font>

29
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:35,450
are bottom left top right so here you go

30
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:38,059
how many routes are in the ipv6 routing

31
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">table since 2004 every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our bottom left</font>

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,820
top right God you've done well<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500 how</font>

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:47,000
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the ipv4 routing table oh my</font>

34
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:49,839
god 280,000 what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look like when</font>

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,840
you compare the two together

36
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:58,790
oops so okay let me be kind to this let

37
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">me do ratios ipv4 over the ipv6 as a</font>

38
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,860
percentage wise you're currently going

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,350
at point four five percent and it hasn't

40
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,419
changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> in four years you haven't been</font>

41
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,060
listening heads up stop doing your email

42
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:13,309
start doing some v6 right now you know

43
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,320
that's saying that v6 is point five

44
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:18,200
percent of v4 in terms of routing table

45
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,760
entries yet but it's kind of unfair it's

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,890
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unfair because the other thing</font>

47
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,410
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing in ipv4 is slicing and</font>

48
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,869
dicing every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single AS does on average</font>

49
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:30,500
8.9 routing entries so perhaps I'm being

50
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">very unfair to v6 well maybe it's a</font>

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,960
 question anyway because a whole

52
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:40,700
bunch of you take a v6 prefix advertise

53
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:42,110
it and do nothing with it not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

54
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,510
so let's do it a different way let's ask

55
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:48,170
a different question how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you as</font>

56
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,880
a esas are capable of<font color="#E5E5E5"> running v6 so here</font>

57
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,609
you go bottom left top<font color="#CCCCCC"> right number of a</font>

58
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,400
SS in the ipv6 routing table 11 hundred

59
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:59,180
armed stunned number of IAS is in the

60
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,190
ipv4 routing table<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30,000 bottom left</font>

61
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,690
top right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so okay I won't even do the</font>

62
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,579
dead red line at the bottom this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

63
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:05,930
relative ratio this looks a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

64
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,570
interesting some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you are getting</font>

65
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,600
slightly interested in ipv6 and in fact

66
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,760
since 2006 more of you have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

67
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">more interested that's slightly a</font>

68
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,959
different stand and what it actually

69
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:19,940
says is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they used to be around one</font>

70
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,380
in fifty two percent and now it's

71
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting up to four percent of you are</font>

72
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:28,250
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something in these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> six a</font>

73
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:31,130
sfas slightly better but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the a</font>

74
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,130
s counts pretty weird because there are

75
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,230
25,000 stub<font color="#E5E5E5"> assn only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000 that</font>

76
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,660
actually do transit for other a esas

77
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:41,299
folk in the middle and of the folk in

78
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,850
the middle fifteen percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

79
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,550
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something in v6 and two</font>

80
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,109
percent of the folk at the edge so maybe

81
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were doing transit for others you</font>

82
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">have been listening and if you haven't</font>

83
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,310
you aren't listening because v6 is in

84
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,440
the middle not at the edge interesting

85
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,230
so okay fifteen percent at the transit

86
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,770
aces are announcing prefixes are they

87
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,810
routing v6 don't think so

88
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,940
so need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look a bit harder let's go</font>

89
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:08,920
and look at via dns and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm really</font>

90
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at is the reverse resolution</font>

91
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,780
what are the pointer queries for v6

92
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,520
compared to be four<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you know here's</font>

93
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,320
the graph and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've actually separated it</font>

94
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,720
out this is actually sort of somewhere

95
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,459
between one percent and less and I

96
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,170
separate out between asia-pacific

97
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:27,040
networks and the rest of the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

98
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:29,050
somewhere in early 2003 early 2008

99
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,040
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> got really really interested in</font>

100
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:36,130
Reverse resolving dns names but you know

101
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,320
the dns is so bloody weird there are

102
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,700
cases forwarders and all kinds of crap

103
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,320
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when you start looking at the</font>

104
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,180
authority of data servers even though

105
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,620
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of point two percent the real</font>

106
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,780
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that none of us have a bloody</font>

107
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,340
clue what's happening with<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns anyway so</font>

108
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,590
it's kind of a useless number so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

109
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:52,989
move on the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing is to actually</font>

110
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,369
have a look at web server stats and you

111
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:55,750
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that you guys won't</font>

112
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,180
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> is access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your web server</font>

113
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,100
logs you bastards so I've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use my</font>

114
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,080
own and right for you kindly let me

115
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,580
their logs as well and what I look as

116
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,560
the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of unique visitors per day</font>

117
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,359
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all this kind of methodology</font>

118
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,430
but cut the what<font color="#E5E5E5"> am I trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

119
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,370
say what I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when your</font>

120
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">duel home in v6 and v4 what's the</font>

121
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:17,290
proportion of visitors in each protocol

122
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,000
yeah day by day and here's what happened

123
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,570
in AP<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nick every day since the first of</font>

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">January 2004 somewhere between half a</font>

125
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:28,000
percent and<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero and it kind of got a</font>

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,700
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more you know busy more</font>

127
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,240
recently you know but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we ain't</font>

128
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:36,280
Google and these numbers are tiny so the

129
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,350
noise factor is pretty high so that's

130
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,000
just one web server so then<font color="#E5E5E5"> right very</font>

131
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:41,770
kindly gave me their data from Europe

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">that looks kind of interesting put the</font>

133
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:46,390
two together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oh god we</font>

134
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,830
agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you know maybe it is round</font>

135
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:53,469
about somewhere between point2 2.5% but

136
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,180
it's weird yeah because<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single</font>

137
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:56,630
time we hold a meeting like you know

138
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,880
Aaron this week

139
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,890
well god I better turn on v6 and look

140
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,420
politically correct and then when you go

141
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,590
home again sup bugger<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for a jerk</font>

142
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you back to where you were again</font>

143
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,239
however yes the relative use has been

144
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,560
increasing slowly and you know if you

145
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,780
have a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the patient</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the patient's</font>

146
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,710
doing point four percent so is this a

147
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,539
case if you're actually getting

148
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,159
interested in v6 is it because visitors

149
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,470
shipping that<font color="#CCCCCC"> automatically tries to do</font>

150
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,150
it on you by default works the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunneling</font>

151
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,260
going on well the beauty of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is you</font>

152
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:23,719
can actually have a look at source

153
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,670
addresses right and here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 624</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

154
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,340
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the v6 and here's the</font>

155
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:31,700
tirado as a percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the v6 that</font>

156
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,010
tirado figure is weird because if that's

157
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,170
vista it should never happen because

158
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">vista only uses tirado was the absolute</font>

159
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:42,170
last resort when even v4 has failed and

160
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:46,400
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your home what are you guys</font>

161
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:48,530
doing with<font color="#CCCCCC"> teredo it's not vista it's my</font>

162
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,450
raid 0 it's all you'd like mimics people

163
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,849
out there you're playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't you and</font>

164
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,880
you've been playing since oh you know

165
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,530
late 2006 what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look like well I</font>

166
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,540
can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and smooth this around but it's</font>

167
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:01,340
as noisy as hell but what I can say is

168
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,690
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still around one quarter of all</font>

169
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,239
the visits to these<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites are actually</font>

170
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting there on tunnels and that hasn't</font>

171
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,340
changed one little bit so what's the

172
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,290
kind of thing with this well in the

173
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:13,820
routing sense in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> aliases around</font>

174
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:16,430
one in six of you are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

175
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,790
with v6 one way or another but

176
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:21,980
realistically you know the v6 out of

177
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,950
there on the net around four parts per

178
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:27,530
thousand and quite frankly that's

179
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:30,140
exaggerating the number because I'm

180
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,719
undercounting default because a huge

181
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,550
number of you sit behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> nounced and I'm</font>

182
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,160
actually measuring the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nats not the end</font>

183
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:39,890
hosts and the other thing too is that

184
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,350
you know like it or not you know no one

185
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,969
actually really visits<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap Nick net we're</font>

186
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,130
not the world's most exciting website

187
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,720
you know dirty little<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret and you</font>

188
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:50,030
know the ones that do visit are actually

189
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,970
only tech weenies so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

190
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,070
looked at some decent<font color="#E5E5E5"> populous sites my</font>

191
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:58,730
guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people actually</font>

192
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:00,680
out there in v6 is lower not for parts

193
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,930
per thousand<font color="#CCCCCC"> are be generous to parts</font>

194
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,419
per thousand so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really</font>

195
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,669
say about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big picture the whole idea</font>

196
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the internet keeps growing the ipv4</font>

197
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,948
size is Reggie getting there too

198
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:13,719
nowhere and the theory was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ipv6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

199
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,400
going to come to the rescue so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

200
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,350
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some numbers now you're almost</font>

201
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,150
close to the death of before in terms of

202
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,759
availability and what you're going to do

203
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,530
with v6 oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're starting late</font>

204
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,610
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're at point two percent</font>

205
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,169
and you have Oh about a year and a half

206
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:38,409
which really means it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

207
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:42,069
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you six minutes and 35</font>

208
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,620
slides very well done sir um tight

209
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:48,820
underwear quick question on all of those

210
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:52,300
graphs the prefixes the ASA's there's

211
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:55,120
this weird dip / flattening for all of

212
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:56,410
2006 what was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well you know</font>

213
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,940
actually as far as I can see what

214
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,219
happened is that the academic and

215
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,140
research folk and a few others in 2004

216
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,120
really decided that that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year of</font>

217
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,649
ipv6 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was actually an</font>

218
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,250
extraordinary amount of effort in it and

219
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:11,589
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> fear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he sucks it wasn't it was</font>

220
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,000
not okay think it didn't happen but a

221
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:15,010
huge amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort actually from the</font>

222
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,810
research networks all over the world in

223
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,700
this area actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> pumped the numbers up</font>

224
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:22,630
for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they all lost</font>

225
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:25,899
interest and around 2006 early 2007

226
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,610
boring and it's only more recently when

227
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:30,520
these numbers about<font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for exhaustion</font>

228
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:33,339
vector said oh my god I won't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

229
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,829
resign and run away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the problem all</font>

230
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:38,200
of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden where you're working now the</font>

231
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:40,000
job you're in now is the problem you

232
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually have to solve it you can't run</font>

233
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">away is I suspect why there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

234
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:50,980
interest now hey don't just a quick note

235
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:53,500
on 6606 we turn down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the six bone so</font>

236
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,540
that's some ergo real words in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> slaw</font>

237
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,660
housing<font color="#E5E5E5"> six you'll see the six button</font>

238
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:02,230
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> disappear yeah Jeff bouquet</font>

239
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:03,880
from lagna Kip we also measuring some of

240
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,190
this stuff and one of interesting thing

241
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">we did is try to measure how many access</font>

242
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,589
to our registration system we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

243
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,870
v6 against over before to see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

244
00:10:11,589 --> 00:10:16,660
much our own community is using

245
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">sixth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> largest our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own services and we</font>

246
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,560
get something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like two different be six</font>

247
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,199
hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> per week and they're normally our</font>

248
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,040
own yeah but counting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cakes is kind</font>

249
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:31,810
of unfair but<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead still we just get</font>

250
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,490
our own addresses thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> G</font>

251
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:36,969
with as much as I had to drink last

252
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,589
night this looks pretty bad oh well I

253
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:40,660
was just wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if in the near future</font>

254
00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:43,170
you see the possibility of a government

255
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">bailout</font>

256
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,670
you know you know there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

257
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,590
speculation on an address market in some

258
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:59,949
speculation on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the price of addresses</font>

259
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,560
and one of the more wild estimates is

260
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:05,500
that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to /a it's going to</font>

261
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:14,739
cost approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 700 billion dollars</font>

262
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:18,720
thank you all right next up we'll have

263
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,720
