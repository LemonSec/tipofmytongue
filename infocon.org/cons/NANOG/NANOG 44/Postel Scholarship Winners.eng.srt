00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:51,060
very little cable all our upstream

31
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:55,319

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,380
have 500 milliseconds and up we have 1i

setups we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually end up using</font>

56
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,840
that dish but it goes to show the

57
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:21,260
differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> in what we have to go</font>

58
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,670
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a network setup the</font>

meetings afterwards and before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

65
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,459
have one<font color="#CCCCCC"> week to do the entire setup</font>

66
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:44,780
which I saw being done in six hours and

67
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:46,849
I was pretty impressed so there's some

68
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,209
lessons of land from coming here first

69
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:52,849
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the content is always something to</font>

70
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:56,750
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> something new to see and new toys</font>

71
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:58,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">to play with also I've noticed that the</font>

72
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:04,069
preparations here for the meetings are

73
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,668
bit further on than in<font color="#E5E5E5"> say F nog and we</font>

74
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:09,018
also seem to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more people</font>

75
00:04:06,669 --> 00:04:12,560
contributing towards this up to set up

76
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:15,109
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the knork and infrastructure and all</font>

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,298
that I've also seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

78
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:19,160
actually give one<font color="#E5E5E5"> hour notification or</font>

79
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:23,870
less for lightning talk and still have

80
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:25,940
one and the tools here a bit more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

81
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:27,620
difference is a lot of the tools which I

82
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,289
saw especially in the north were carried

83
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,830
on laptops whereas we tend to build a

84
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:33,020
tool

85
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,570
on the fly every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go for that one</font>

86
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:39,020
week so hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go back and then</font>

87
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:47,560
see what we can change<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that so any</font>

88
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:47,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions comments</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Tracy</font>

former is it any the PDF<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

99
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,969
so what we just saw another ancestor

100
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:42,159
when the hell people's rheumatism is

103
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:54,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">cold in this room is fantastic getting</font>

104
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,570
like a cold draft coming from somewhere

105
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:01,880
anyway um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah don't forget</font>

106
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go away excitement find out who</font>

107
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,540
the new steering committee is in about

108
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,979
one hour from now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think the other</font>

109
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,770
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's probably worth mentioning</font>

110
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,690
is once we're after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coffee break</font>

111
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,760
this afternoon we're then going to be in

112
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,680
a position where we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font>

113
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,030
again all in the same room again until

114
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,250
tomorrow morning because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all</font>

115
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,909
breakout breakout stuff and tracks this

116
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,170
afternoon after the coffee break so I

117
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,810
think the other thing I'll do is I'll

118
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,580
plug tomorrow morning which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the first</font>
