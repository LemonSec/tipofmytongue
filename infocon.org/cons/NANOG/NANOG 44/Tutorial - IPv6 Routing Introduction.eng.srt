addressing and routing protocols it's

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,810
really intended as an introduction I'm

27
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,060
not going to get into really complex

28
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,610
convoluted configurations and so forth

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,320
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant to be a kind of primer</font>

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,020
for those of you who haven't really

31
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,610
touched v6 before or maybe a started to

32
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,539
touch it but I'm quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what you</font>

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,829
put this together was it two years ago I

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,110
think might have been two years ago

again at the joint nano<font color="#CCCCCC"> Guerin meeting</font>

the slides well I've put them up on my

at<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to take a look at some</font>

addressing plans for ipv6 this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

52
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,790
kind of giving folks some general

53
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,470
indication of what I see people in

54
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,150
industry doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not jen i'm not</font>

55
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:36,489
saying that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you should do</font>

56
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm just saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what I see ISPs</font>

57
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:41,829
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I find that one of the biggest</font>

58
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:45,069
barriers to some of the deployment with

59
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:46,959
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> people tell me is that oh we don't</font>

60
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:50,109
know how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the addressing plans 128</font>

61
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,319
bits is huge and I'm confused<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I try</font>

62
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:55,599
to reduce the confusion a little bit we

63
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:59,230
then look at how we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally</font>

64
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,569
configure ipv6 and then do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bb6</font>

65
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,099
routing protocols overview so we're

66
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:07,030
looking like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so of ospf is is and bgp</font>

67
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:11,768
going to cover three operating systems

68
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:13,720
so iOS iOS XR and jew nose pin to

69
00:03:11,769 --> 00:03:15,579
anybody else with other operating

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,340
systems if you'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your bits</font>

71
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:20,230
in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would love your contributions</font>

72
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,730
because I know if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get something</font>

73
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,369
that covers all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> major operating</font>

74
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,530
systems quite happy to add these in the

75
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,730
slides as a general archive for the

76
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:33,730
community<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's look at the</font>

77
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:36,548
addressing first so where you get your

78
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:38,828
v6 addresses from the regional internet

79
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,620
registries and if you're a member of

80
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:43,889
what most of you be a member of Aaron

81
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,810
you can go to iron get<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 address</font>

82
00:03:43,889 --> 00:03:49,959
you don't have a 101 questions to answer

83
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:51,569
as you do for ipv4 address space it

84
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,980
should be reasonably straightforward

85
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,078
you're not a member of Aaron you can

86
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,480
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> a member or you can go to your</font>

87
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">upstream ISP and get address space from</font>

88
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,619
them but generally I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you know if</font>

89
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,319
anybody who's providing services so

90
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:06,880
service providers you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

91
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,518
get your own independent address space

92
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,168
because I believe it tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

93
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming and everything else a lot</font>

94
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:15,530
easier

95
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:16,820
down the path you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also use 624 I'm</font>

96
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,860
not really going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> touch on what</font>

97
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:21,920
patters too much that's the alternative

98
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:25,820
you have irritable v4 address you can

99
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,660
you try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and use 624 register regions</font>

100
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:33,710
just in case you didn't where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

101
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:35,570
so on me getting the v6 address space as

102
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say become a member of your region</font>

103
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,280
Linton registry and get your own

104
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,109
allocation genuine you require a plan

105
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,440
for a year ahead of their abodes

106
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,600
depending which registry you go to and

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:50,510
actual allocation policies are will be

108
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,220
documented on on each registries website

109
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,219
so they're all this they are subtly

110
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,620
different but the general principles are

111
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,170
pretty much the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

112
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,240
plenty of ipv6 address space<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say</font>

113
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,900
that endless amounts because the current

114
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,820
policy is probably are working or

115
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,190
attempting to work through the v6

116
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,810
address space probably faster than some

117
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,840
folks expected but there certainly is

118
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:18,200
plenty of it not like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation we</font>

119
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,450
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for if you get from your</font>

120
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,940
own from your upstream isp you would

121
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,650
gently get a single / 48 from them

122
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,100
unless you can demonstrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

123
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:31,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to need more of course a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slash</font>

124
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">party it gives you 65,000 subnets if you</font>

125
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,110
have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 65,000 subnets in your</font>

126
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,890
network then you probably get another /

127
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:44,000
48 and so on it goes as for<font color="#CCCCCC"> sixth and</font>

128
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">4624 you take a single public</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv4 / 32</font>

129
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,830
address put 2002 in front of it that

130
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:53,150
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> you your / 48 and that gives you</font>

131
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,979
65,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> subnets that you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and play with</font>

132
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,099
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of thing I've done at</font>

133
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:01,130
my house in Australia my SP kind of goes

134
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,290
what's ipv6 but they kindly gave me a

135
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,290
writable v4 address they don't match me

136
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:08,300
yet so I just used 624<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that works</font>

137
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,940
all quite nice and<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily so I've got</font>

138
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:15,770
65,000 subnets for my house anyway so

139
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,430
let's look at how we do some of the

140
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,830
actual addressing

141
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of general guidelines</font>

142
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,128
that have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> people do I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not saying</font>

143
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:26,810
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what you should be doing</font>

144
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:31,310
but these are general guidelines what I

145
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:33,080
see folks doing address block for all

146
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,479
the router loopback interfaces me pretty

147
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,039
much these days in v4 you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a / 32</font>

148
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:42,830
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to loop back so for v6 won a</font>

149
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:45,889
single / 128 for each loop back and you

150
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:49,248
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> number all the loop backs in your</font>

151
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:51,409
network out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a single / 64 that allows</font>

152
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:55,779
up to 2 to the power 64 routers which is

153
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:58,188
probably enough for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time being um</font>

154
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:59,779
then you set aside<font color="#E5E5E5"> an address block for</font>

155
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:01,969
infrastructure now again see different

ISPs do different things mean a single /

157
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:08,389

158
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:10,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of infrastructure you think about</font>

161
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,349
rsps will use a single /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 to 8 for the</font>

162
00:07:15,529 --> 00:07:21,259

/ 48<font color="#CCCCCC"> / point of presence because I</font>

164
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:27,050
suppose the imagine you'll use all

65,000 subnets in that pop some of them

166
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,879
will probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> / 48 for a region so</font>

it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a few cities or maybe</font>

168
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:38,330
for example here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the US it could be a</font>

185
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:22,339
lot of debate about point-to-point links

186
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,949
it's kind of wandered around<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

187
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:26,260
different places again looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> expectation of the</font>

195

I don't care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're quite</font>

196

happy to use /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 120 sixes and just ignore</font>

198
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:55,710
using / 112 switch is still ensure that

00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:58,600
mobile ipv6 hobe agent discovery works

200
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:01,270
it leaves the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 bits free for</font>

201
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,700
various other possibilities that could

202
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,520
be coming along and then even<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

203
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,290
people thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> / atas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or / 96</font>

204
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:14,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">azure very how various other</font>

205
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:16,150
combinations RFC 3627 is it's pretty old

206
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,329
now but there was some discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

207
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,730
about what people should or should not

208
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,950
do for for point-to-point link addresses

209
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,900
what's the right answer I quite honestly

210
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,840
truthfully do not know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the right</font>

211
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,600
answer is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still quite early in the</font>

212
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,700
piece as some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I do quite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

213
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,460
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of workshops teaching v6 routing and</font>

214
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,230
so forth and in those I just use / 64

215
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">for the point-to-point links then at</font>

216
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:42,250
least i'm working the principle of least

217
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,930
surprised there isn't anything the

218
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:46,360
future is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come along but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

219
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:48,430
to cause me to renumber my / 126 isn't

220
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,320
something else and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be majorly</font>

221
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,290
painful to try and do that if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font>

222
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,130
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so anyway so that's really what I</font>

223
00:09:53,290 --> 00:10:01,410
see folks are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do as for</font>

224
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:01,410
customers well they<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single / 48</font>

225
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,440
that's probably simple but then again I

226
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,360
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> summarized piece for saying are you</font>

227
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:13,060
think big to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a slip so guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

228
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,710
quite small to get a / 4840 it's been

229
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,219
big for you maybe you should get / 56

230
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,960
and so I see some kind of slicing and

231
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,580
dicing happening happening in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that side</font>

232
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,800
as well which I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think really was</font>

233
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:26,710
the intention of the developers

234
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:29,430
originally so you see 56 is going out

235
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:31,360
there you see six days going out there

236
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know kind of what is the definition</font>

237
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,870
of a customer I mean doesn't broadband

238
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,780
customer with three computers at home

239
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,490
really need a slash 48

240
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,079
so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of discussion</font>

241
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,590
going on in various parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world</font>

242
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:46,440
about that size but anyway customers get

243
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">one / 48 for customer needs more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

244
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">single / 48 and they're probably pretty</font>

245
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,660
big like they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than 65,000</font>

246
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">subnodes I generally ask for v4 mean</font>

247
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,439
this is again my preference try not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

248
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">do the reservation of address space and</font>

249
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,990
power point of presence basis you're

250
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,810
using ibgp to carry a lot of the custom

251
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,120
address space around so a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

252
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,920
tend not to be aggregating this on a per

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,350
parte basis and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if you are</font>

254
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,569
aggregating on a pearpod basis then you

255
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:20,970
probably want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do want to try and</font>

256
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:23,880
reserve chunks of / 48 per pop so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

257
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,980
tried to draw a pretty picture that sort

258
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,540
of explains this transition hasn't

259
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,020
worked but that's a shame but anyway

260
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,959
phase one is the the top part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">show started to hear the loop banks I've</font>

263
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:42,450
picked the first / 64 in the 32 address

00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">block and then I've picked the first /</font>

48 for the service provider

266
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:51,990
infrastructure why did<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do that well</font>

267
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,570
laziness really i mean i started off

268
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing v6 workshops by five six years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

269
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,470
and actually use the top end because

270
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,780
that's kind of what i did in v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll use</font>

271
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:02,910
those like a last whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of the v4</font>

272
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,459
address space just because what no

273
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:07,469
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> really but i found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out typing in</font>

274
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,780
these big addresses with lots of F F F s

275
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,660
and so forth were prone to errors so I

276
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,089
picked this first / 48 the v6 address

277
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,060
becomes nice and short less typing to do

278
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:19,950
less chance of arrows and that's just

initial v6 configuration going so start

316
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:03,079
off looking at iOS so the global command

317
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,780
to switch on v6 is basically ipv6

318

unicast routing it's not enabled in iOS

319

by default one of these years it might

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,860
actually change those of you who are as

329
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:37,250
then pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much I cbcp these days is to</font>

330
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,740
disable ipv6 source routing which again

331
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:41,800
is on by default so you need to do no

ipv6 source routing to switch that off

333
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:48,469
if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at XR which is available on</font>

straightforward you go into the inet6

family and you just drop in the address

356
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:46,640
they're so pretty much what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do in v4</font>

pop the v4 address there on the inet

open to the world v6 even though it's

401
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,130
locked down and v4 so if you're doing

402
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,690
any v4 filtering make sure you

403
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:58,450
supplement them with v6 now when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

actually activate an interface with v6

405
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:03,770
for example the IRS configuration

406
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:06,139
they're saying ipv6 enable you will

407
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:09,590
automatically get what's called a

408
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,770
link-local an ipv6 address so every

409
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:14,330
interface will have that whether you

410
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:17,240
configure a real v6 address or in other

411
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,220
words global unicast v6 address you will

412

<font color="#E5E5E5">always have a link local address there</font>

413
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,330
as well that's one of the differences

414
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,889
between v4 and v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> the connectivity</font>

415

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that on on the interface</font>

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface and we see that fe 80 I mean</font>

428
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,490
I've got a pointer here but which the

429
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:03,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">four screens to point you to a little</font>

430
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,720
bit you you see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fe 80 address there</font>

431
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,810
but halfway down on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right hand side</font>

432
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,270
of the screen<font color="#E5E5E5"> fe8 a double colon and</font>

433
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,030
then that rather big thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

434
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,889
basically the mac address of the router

435
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:16,480
with an FF

436
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:18,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">he inserted in the middle so that</font>

437
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically takes the mac address and</font>

438
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:25,450
converts it into about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eui-64 format</font>

439
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:30,280
that v6 uses so you will see those no

440
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:32,590
escape from them so giving a<font color="#CCCCCC"> router a</font>

441
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,720
real address this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case is an EU</font>

442
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:36,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">I 64 address you'll see in the show</font>

443
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,410
interface status that it's what actually

444
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:42,520
says look you've configured me an EU

445
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:45,100
i-64 address out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 2001 DBA / 64</font>

446
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,570
address block and so you get this you

447
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,740
see near the top on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left you see</font>

448
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:53,260
this rather large ipv6 address there so

449
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,880
if you do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use eui-64 that's the</font>

450
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:57,490
sort of size or addresses you'll be

451
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,290
dealing with that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tend to find</font>

452
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:03,070
operators these days<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> switching this</font>

stuff on<font color="#CCCCCC"> op to try and keep the dressing</font>

454
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:10,480
as simple as possible for look on iOS XR

455
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:14,860
you see similar things this one is also

456
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,710
eui-64 interface or just on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sharpie v6</font>

457
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:19,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">and interface you see the subnet that</font>

458
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:23,710
its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you see the link local</font>

459
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,929
address and so forth and on Juno's so

460
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,190
again similar things here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look bit</font>

461
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:29,520
farther down you see the link local

configured interface address<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's</font>

464
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the routing protocols well one</font>

465
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:42,550
thing you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a lot of</font>

466
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,280
configuration for v6 and writers is

467
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:47,290
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you did in v4 it's virtually</font>

468
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,780
the same for ipv6 you just replace

469
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:51,940
whatever the IP commands where all the

470
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,580
v4 address-family commands with the

471

coolant ipv6 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 address family</font>

472
00:20:54,580 --> 00:21:00,520

473
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,760
relatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple so here's a v6 static</font>

474
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,860
route in iOS so you rather than I<font color="#CCCCCC"> PRN</font>

475
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,990
does it have a v4 you do ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrote</font>

476
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,879
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the destination you've got</font>

477
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:11,560

<font color="#CCCCCC">the administrative distance that you</font>

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:27,770
v6 unicast address family then

483
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,300
put in the destination the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next hop</font>

484
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:33,379

distance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jonas is pretty pretty</font>

486
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:40,580
similar configuration again as well we

00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,590
go into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one which pretty much</font>

shows you how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for static routes</font>

489
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:48,169
will go into the inet6 rib we go into

490
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:51,920
the static sub configuration we set up a

491
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:55,400

top and we specify the metric<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

493
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,880
you recognize this from v4 you just see

494
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:05,270
it using the inet6<font color="#CCCCCC"> address-family</font>

configuring a static default for example

00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:25,250
in v6 is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much saying ipv6 route</font>

longest match routing algorithm we've

identifies the right from the network

539
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,460
iOS will automatically generate this

from the loopback interface that one is

541
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,110

551
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:51,379
interesting a few years ago when people

552
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,060
were heading off down that path they ran

553
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the whole issue of while writing</font>

554
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,169
protocols are beautifully configured but

555
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,450
no router ID so nothing actually worked

556
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:02,240
these days most people I know are

557
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:06,350
deploying dual stack so you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

558
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:08,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">have your router ID there anyway some</font>

559
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,469
people will manually configure the

560
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,360
router ID because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's their</font>

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,910
operational policy or practice for doing

562
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,280
so so in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just specify the</font>

563
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:20,360
router ID command as I'm sure an example

564
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:23,510
there XR well for v4 routing protocols

565
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:28,580
again XR will automatically generate the

566
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:30,620
router ID but BGP requires it to be

567
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:35,780
manually configured so there's one

568
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:38,840
example sofa glamping or router bgp will

569
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:41,149
have used the extended AS example here

570
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:44,330
the 32 various example putting in a

advice configure router the explicitly

580
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,679
so again you just put the router ID

581
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:14,929
specify the ipv4 address the writer IDs

582
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:17,690
a 32-bit integer is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> convenient that</font>

583
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:20,119
an ipv4 address is also a 32-bit integer

00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:22,700
which is why<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's use the snow doesn't</font>

yeah I JP<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is cisco iOS</font>

612
00:27:28,129 --> 00:27:34,730
and the ipv6 protocol as well so the

615
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:43,879
the same so it's an iOS 12.4 of enemies

but looking at the configuration

622
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:59,269
remember v4 would be router eigrp

623
00:27:56,409 --> 00:28:02,929
something's of ipv6 you just do ipv6

router eigrp something and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

625
00:28:02,929 --> 00:28:07,549
basically specify which interfaces are

I've been working with have said oh my

that how do I mention all my neighbor

horrible depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on writing protocol</font>

641
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:48,349
might specify which interface and so

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,989
forth but v6 it says well my neighbor

657
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:30,289
for ipv6 it's based on ospf v2 with

658
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:33,199
enhancements it carries v6 prefixes it

does not carry before prefixes same as

ospf v2 does not carry ipv6 prefixes if

661
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:42,169
you know what it means it ships in the

one interesting differences ospfv3 runs

676
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:21,880
in a link rather than power IP subnet so

677
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,800
link basically is while the connection

678
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,480
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> two particular devices how they</font>

680
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,040
layer so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually a lot handier</font>

681
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,860
than well something those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've used</font>

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,690
the masks have to match with interface

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,870
addresses or maybe they don't have to

687
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:46,150
match and they might still roughly work

688
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:48,459
it's quite confusing for newcomers

do this running it on the link layer as

00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,260
you'll see in a few slides time it's

692
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:55,929
actually very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy to set up and it</font>

693
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:59,020
just looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like setting up my ass is in</font>

694
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:02,830
fact you can support<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple instances</font>

695
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:06,070

than just running on a subnet in<font color="#CCCCCC"> now or</font>

697
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:10,060
you can run multiple instances on the

anything that we do but if you're

<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the actual protocol design</font>

715
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,500
you have to upgrade all the routers in

your network to support that us LSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font>

else packet formats changed to new lsas

724
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:23,179
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to look at those so</font>

725
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:25,908
configuring ospf in v3 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS well</font>

726
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:30,169
rather than doing router ospf we do ipv6

727
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:31,759
router ospf interfaces are configured

728
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:33,529
directly you've got no more<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network</font>

do and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> native ipv6 router Lord</font>

733
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:49,039
that's sports done simply because ospf

00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,720
v2 and v3 of new interaction with each

735
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,820
other so it was considered better to

736
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,889
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> them completely separate those of</font>

subscribe to ospf configuration for some

reason appears right on the bottom of

741
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:05,989
the of the iOS configuration display

742
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:07,789
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not helpful so</font>

00:33:05,989 --> 00:33:11,450
entering the Rajah<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode you can I p6</font>

744
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:13,519
router ospf got the process ID an

745
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:16,580
interface mode we then go into the

746
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,559
interface into ipv6 ospf which process

747

751
00:33:24,619 --> 00:33:32,359
extras we can look at various ospf<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

752
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,499
things the configuring authentication

753
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:40,759
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> further down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it just uses the v6</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mom I suppose one of the ipsec</font>

756
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,008
sophisticated released it gives you the

757
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,269
neighbor authentication if you so desire

758
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:53,389
so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a real configuration</font>

759
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:56,149
example we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got two routers here to</font>

760
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:58,248
different areas looking at round 21

761
00:33:56,149 --> 00:34:01,609
which is parked there between<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 0 and</font>

762
00:33:58,249 --> 00:34:04,669
area one interface pause 11 is sitting

763
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:08,449
area 0 so all we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ipv6 Roger or</font>

764
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:10,579
SPF 100 100 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process ID interface</font>

765
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:13,189
pulse 11 is sitting in where is the

766
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:17,210
sitting area<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros which is to ipv6 ospf</font>

767
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:20,990
100 area 0 and pause 20 which is sitting

768
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,789
in area 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ipv6 ospf 100 area 1 so</font>

769
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:25,138
those folks using is<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS will recognize</font>

770
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:28,139
this and go haha ospf has done something

771
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,809
at last interesting enough you can now

772
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,240
do all this kind of thing in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> boss PF</font>

773
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:35,760
version to subtly an iOS so if you're

774
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:39,118
using ospf in iOS you can do this style

775
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,099
configuration as well which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an order</font>

776
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of magnitude simpler than the old style</font>

777
00:34:43,099 --> 00:34:50,279
looking at the v6 ospf<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> watch look</font>

778
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,139
in the v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing-table ospfv3 again is</font>

779
00:34:50,279 --> 00:34:54,359
just indicated by the 0 entry on the

780
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:56,909
left there and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

781
00:34:54,359 --> 00:35:00,240
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next hop addresses the link</font>

782
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:03,960

783
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,459
router ball address anymore and so the

784
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,380
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have been deploying this</font>

785
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,269
and be<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing workshop with God does it</font>

786
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:11,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">really have to be less at least you get</font>

787
00:35:09,269 --> 00:35:16,078
the interface listed there but you know

788
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:18,390
so what devices f82 d0 FFM and so forth

789
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">and as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I said before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't go</font>

790
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:24,269
carrying MAC addresses around in your

791
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:26,460
head that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it is done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok you</font>

792
00:35:24,269 --> 00:35:27,450
can run or<font color="#E5E5E5"> spare v3 over tunnels if you</font>

793
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,980
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so that's a</font>

794
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:30,598
configuration how you might want to do

795
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,130
it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're still trying to tunnel</font>

796
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:38,730
things over your infrastructure moving

797
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:40,380
on to X are so different folks doing the

798
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,799
coding here so they've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to lift</font>

799
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,200
called it ospfv3 as the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

800
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:49,410
rather than router ospf from v2 we've

801
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:53,058
called it router ospfv3 then process IDs

802
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:55,049
multiple ospf processes if you want

803
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:58,200
activating interfaces is done in the

804
00:35:55,049 --> 00:36:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">router mode so rather than going into</font>

805
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:02,848
the interface and doing IP route or

806
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,029
whatever ipv6 right worth whatever you

807
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:07,440
go into the router ospf<font color="#CCCCCC"> p3 and i need</font>

808
00:36:06,029 --> 00:36:10,319
two areas you and then you list which

809
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,150
interfaces sit in this area<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

810
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:15,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">different but that's how they chose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

811
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:17,910
do it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you got again you've got</font>

812
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:22,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">the show commands I'm sure I ospfv3</font>

813
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:24,390
clear ospfv3 and so forth looking at

814
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,750
specific attributes while we can do show

815
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:30,629
SPF III and so forth doing the tenth

816
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:34,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">occasion neighbor authentication sorg NP</font>

817
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:36,599
and similar to iOS but slightly

818
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,250
different but again the same idea using

819
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:41,060
the

820
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:42,710
the built-in<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPSec so here's a</font>

821
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:44,590
configuration example have taken exactly

822
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:47,900
the same layout same addressing and

823
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:50,000
giving you the XR configuration instead

824
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:52,580
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't bore you by going through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

825
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,470
precisely but you notice how the router

826
00:36:52,580 --> 00:37:01,750
ospfv3 configuration has specifies each

827
00:36:57,470 --> 00:37:05,299
area which interfaces sits in which area

828
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:07,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then looking at the basic</font>

829
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:10,550
writing table looks the same as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it did</font>

830
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:13,340
in iOS pretty much configuring it in

831
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:17,800
junos well on Juno's we go into the

832
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:20,420
protocol section we call it ospf<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 there</font>

833
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,020
then we see and we specify the areas in

834
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,490
which interfaces<font color="#CCCCCC"> sit in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which area</font>

835
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:28,250
member<font color="#CCCCCC"> prepares</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> command mode show ospf</font>

836
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:30,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">three clear ospf three if you are</font>

837
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:37,640
accustomed to using ospf on Juno's it's

838
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:40,130
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much ospf</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 instead now</font>

839
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">configuring ospfv3 on Juno's differences</font>

840
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:43,580
from iOS is no support<font color="#CCCCCC"> for 10th occation</font>

841
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:46,760
basically because it not been specified

842
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,980
in RFC 5340 and it's generally replaced

843
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,930
by the v6 authentication header<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't</font>

844
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get any configuration examples</font>

845
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:57,940
of what could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done but I'm sure</font>

846
00:37:54,710 --> 00:38:00,230
somebody will correct me at some stage

847
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,020
so just doing a general configuration

848
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:07,280
example game the same picture we had

849
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:08,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">before configuration runs into two</font>

850
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,460
slides so we've got the router to

851
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:14,060
configuration there it's sitting

852
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:16,220
completely in area 1 so we go into the

853
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,190
interface we configure the dress and

854
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,720
interface we go into the router options

855
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:24,530
to set the router ID we go into the

856
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,930
protocols specify the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet interface</font>

857
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:31,510
fast ethernet 300 is sitting in area

858
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:35,480
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 and we give it a metric of 100 on</font>

859
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:38,830
router one again we set up the interface

860
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:43,100
configuration we specify the router ID

861
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:45,049
and then we go in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the ospf</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

862
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">under under the protocol set against</font>

863
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:48,330
specifying an area<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 which interface is</font>

864
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:50,220
sitting

865
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:53,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in areas you which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interface is</font>

866
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,379
sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there I guess what what XR</font>

867
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:57,150
has done is tried to follow roughly the

868
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,140
idea of how June haces can configure

869
00:38:57,150 --> 00:39:03,540
ospf three ok so again if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

870
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:07,350
ospf version 2 on Juno's this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

871
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:10,440
the same and then looking at the the

872
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:12,980
routing table again you see the next

873
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">hops unknown via link local addresses</font>

874
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,670
are these you know it does tell you an

875
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:22,319
output which interface<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're going to</font>

876
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:26,640
but well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I find it's a bit</font>

877
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,730
a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenging ok as for doing ospfv3</font>

878
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,440
over tunnels and of course the set

879
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:33,710
tunnel services<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick is required to do</font>

880
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,640
that on both ends of the tunnel

881
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:40,770
configurations for this particular

882
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:43,200
scenario was again we set up the the GRE

883
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:45,330
interface we set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> Louis p.m. v3</font>

884
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,490
protocol to run over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gr Jerry</font>

885
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:51,770
interface and that's pretty much an

886
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:56,640
example configuration of how we do this

887
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:58,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias so I'm</font>

888
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,350
sure most of you use IR sighs know what

889
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:07,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's all about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's OSI writing protocol</font>

890
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:11,220
CLS traffic RFC 1195 added IP support

891
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:15,600
RFC 5308 added ipv6 address family

892
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:17,819
support RSC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5122</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find this multi</font>

893
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:22,410
topology concept for is RS which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

894
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:24,750
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain as I go through this ok</font>

895
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:27,509
so we've got to tlv is added to

896
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:29,460
introduce v6 routing so basically Silas

897
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:32,070
is multi-protocol it's just a case of

898
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:35,610
adding another protocol to it so we add

899
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:37,830
tlv is to handle ipv6 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> could the v6</font>

900
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:43,980
which ability and we've got the v6

901
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:48,660
interface address so looking at is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

902
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:51,450
configuration example on iOS but

903
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:54,750
wherever we have what we've got an IP

904
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:57,750
sorry ipv4 is is already running so just

905
00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:00,970
called the writer I<font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias there we've</font>

906
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:03,910
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> an NSF address say that net 4200</font>

907
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:06,549
and so forth we redistribute static int

908
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,160
2 is IRS for whatever reason and never

909
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:12,990
specified address family ipv6 which

910
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:15,399
basically handles the ipv6 piece of this

911
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,529
and then we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the interface and</font>

912
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:20,020
where we have IP router is eyes to

913
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:23,500
handle v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sighs we simply add an ipv6</font>

914
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:25,480
right is is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handling the ipv6 piece</font>

915
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,050
so pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much whatever you did for the</font>

916
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you for you just do the same for v6 and</font>

917
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:33,790
specify the v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> address family you can</font>

918
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:35,950
run it over tunnels if you want not

919
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:40,930
going to bore you with going through all

920
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:44,710
this so we'll try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

921
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:46,990
one let's look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> X are similar concept</font>

922
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:50,050
as well and got router is<font color="#CCCCCC"> RS as we've</font>

923
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:54,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">done for v4 we've specified then SAP</font>

924
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:55,720
address XR is a slight difference we've

925
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:58,930
got the different address families so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

926
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,060
can specify be for unicast v6 unicast so

927
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:04,270
I've got the v4 configuration there the

928
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:06,910
v6 configuration they're not the single

929
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:09,970
topology command now the reason I've

930
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:12,790
done this is because I us sorry iOS by

931
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:15,939
default runs in single topology it

932
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:17,560
assumes that the v4 topology and the v6

933
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:20,470
topology are going to be exactly the

934
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:22,960
same so if you are using is<font color="#CCCCCC"> RS today and</font>

935
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:25,540
you want to deploy v6 across your

936
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:29,190
network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy it everywhere</font>

937
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:31,599
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running v4 and using is is</font>

938
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:33,670
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a this is a bit of an issue</font>

939
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,650
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a bit of an issue for some ISPs</font>

940
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:37,330
who want to do initial deployments so to

941
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:42,010
keep the configurations looking the same

942
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:44,920
I've made them look the same so<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS</font>

943
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:46,990
default is to use a single topology iOS

944
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:49,900
XR s default is to use something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

945
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:52,299
multi topology we're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4</font>

946
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:54,700
topology can be different from the v6

947
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:56,140
topology so I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to turn off the</font>

948
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,200
default here by<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this single</font>

949
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:01,240
topology command and then again carrying

950
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">on with the configuration we then lists</font>

951
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,839
all the interfaces that we have in the

952
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:07,230
right time and we specify which<font color="#E5E5E5"> Idris</font>

953
00:43:04,839 --> 00:43:11,049
family which<font color="#CCCCCC"> interfaces going to sit in</font>

954
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:11,800
or which in a dress family is is is

955
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:17,430
going to run on

956
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:21,400
for each interface moving on to junos

957
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:23,490
quick reminder so this again is going to

958
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:25,750
spill over into two slides we first

959
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:28,779
configure the interface we give it its

960
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:34,470
v4 address that 10 1 11 / 24 we give it

961
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:37,720
a v6 address<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 1 DB eight whatever / 64</font>

962
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:39,430
family is 0 means basically that you're

963
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,459
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to run is I us on this</font>

964
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,230
interface and then the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

965
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:46,380
configuration this is the other fast

966
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:49,870
ethernet interface we do the same piece

967
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:54,700
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got what that's loopback</font>

968
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:57,220
interface also similar thing and we

969
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:00,790
specify then<font color="#CCCCCC"> snap address there then we</font>

970
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,770
head into the protocols section we go

971
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:04,480
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> is into is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RS because that's</font>

972
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:06,100
what configuring we're doing the

973
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,600
redistribute static just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it look</font>

974
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:13,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">like the previous two examples</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is IRS is</font>

975
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,310
going to run on the two fast ethernet

976
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,200
interfaces plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> loopback interface and</font>

977
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:19,750
then we've got different policy

978
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,910
statements there so redistributes static

979
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:23,320
policy statement basically says while

980
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:27,940
from static routes we're going to

981
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:31,630
basically pop pop<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the statics into I</font>

982
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:34,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">esaias ok so that's pretty much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

983
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:36,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">do the same thing in junos again the</font>

984
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,100
whole thing with the tunnels need the

985
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:41,620
tunnel pick to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Assize over ipv6</font>

986
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,680
tunnels what you need the tunnel pick to

987
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:47,920
do tunnels there's a configuration again

988
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:53,950
matching what I've shown earlier with

989
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:57,250
the iOS example<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so if we look at the</font>

990
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:59,680
multi topology is eyes extensions right

991
00:44:57,250 --> 00:45:03,280
so what what as I seen before is is for

992
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:06,390
v6 assume that the v6 topology is the

993
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,660
same as v4 that's that's how the first

994
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:13,150
attempt at handling v6 on is ours went

995
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:15,370
which wow you know if you're deploying

996
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:17,860
v6 across the entire infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual</font>

00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:20,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">stack it's not a problem but suddenly</font>

998
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,680
some of the early<font color="#CCCCCC"> adopters who start to</font>

999
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,450
look at this maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1000
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,669
what to do is is in a corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1001
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:29,210
network or something or handle v6 in the

1002
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:30,980
corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network but or maybe not</font>

1003
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:32,300
run is ours through some routers that

1004
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:35,950
just couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle these six</font>

1005
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:37,700
whatsoever they ended up having problems

1006
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:41,328
because you ended up with basically

1007
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">hauls in the topology so multi de</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paula</font>

1008
00:45:41,329 --> 00:45:45,170
gir size came along basically allowing

1009
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:48,980
you to run a completely separate

1010
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:51,859
infrastructure for v6 and be four so

1011
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,770
that's now specify it's got a nice RFC

1012
00:45:51,859 --> 00:45:57,828
to go with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so basically multi</font>

1013
00:45:54,770 --> 00:46:00,980
apology gives us two topology types 14 I

1014
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:04,040
so V for routing and the other one for

1015
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,559
v6 writing and so generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> you find</font>

1016
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,259
something XR and<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos multi topology is</font>

1017
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:13,400
actually the default<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1018
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:15,200
default so I mean they're the new TL vs

1019
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:18,250
that are specified<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the multi</font>

1020
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:21,799
topology ones which lets us carry the v6

1021
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:24,140
prefixes separately so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1022
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,290
configuration in iOS first thing we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1023
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you notice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're almost at</font>

1024
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:32,270
the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the configuration is we</font>

1025
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to enable wide metrics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we pretty</font>

1026
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:35,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">much anybody who's using iOS RS these</font>

1027
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:38,689
days is using wide metrics but<font color="#E5E5E5"> iOS</font>

1028
00:46:35,930 --> 00:46:42,049
default is still to use the old narrow

1029
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:44,869
metrics from about a decade<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so we</font>

1030
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:47,660
need wide<font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics support and we also</font>

1031
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:50,359
need to specify multi topology within

1032
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:52,009
the v6 address family and doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1033
00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:58,490
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is pretty much the same</font>

1034
00:46:52,010 --> 00:47:00,290
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beforehand what next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1035
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:02,598
look in<font color="#E5E5E5"> X are pretty much all that's</font>

1036
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,099
changed here is the absence<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1037
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:06,619
single topology keyboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> i showed you</font>

1038
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">before and the addition of the metric</font>

1039
00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:12,500
style wide and the in the v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

1040
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">family for iOS is otherwise we have the</font>

1041
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:21,079
same configuration as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mentioned with a</font>

1042
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:23,569
single topology case and in junos so

1043
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:27,500
this again is pretty similar as it was

1044
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:30,200
before trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

1045
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:31,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember exactly what this was all about</font>

1046
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:36,118
but

1047
00:47:31,859 --> 00:47:37,619
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember Ron jumped up last time</font>

1048
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">we did the presentation explain what</font>

1049
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:41,940
this wasn't a forgotten what his

1050
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:44,190
explanation was about but I believe in

1051
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:48,930
junos is actually default to do multi

1052
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:52,710
topology and have white metrics<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1053
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:54,989
moving on to bgp so we have RFC 4760

1054
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:59,069
which defines multi-protocol extensions

1055
00:47:54,989 --> 00:48:01,289
for bgp mean bgp and other days as you

1056
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:03,599
know was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just carrying v4 addresses and</font>

1057
00:48:01,289 --> 00:48:06,779
then we had the multicast folks handling

1058
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:10,079
multicast information around within bgp

1059
00:48:06,779 --> 00:48:14,970
and v6 folks then started adding v6

1060
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:18,599
prefixes so the need to carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multiple</font>

1061
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:21,299
multiple protocols within<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP became</font>

1062
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:24,119
quite necessary so multi protocol bgp

1063
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:26,730
basically defines different address

1064
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:30,930
families to carry<font color="#E5E5E5"> different types of</font>

1065
00:48:26,730 --> 00:48:34,650
protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2545 actually specifies what</font>

1066
00:48:30,930 --> 00:48:36,538
the extensions are to handle v6 so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 45</font>

1067
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:38,999
is quite a low number so it's been quite

1068
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:41,160
a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago it's probably about 96 97</font>

1069
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:43,288
there abouts basically when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> six born</font>

1070
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,410
basically fell to pieces as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1071
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:52,289
remember when it was using rip ng and so

1072
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:56,549
the BGP hand in v6 can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i pick</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly so</font>

1073
00:48:52,289 --> 00:48:58,589
4760 defines new optional non-trans of

1074
00:48:56,549 --> 00:49:00,930
attributes we've got this multi-protocol

1075
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:05,249
reach ability nlr I and the non reach

1076
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:07,410
ability nlr I and it carries information

1077
00:49:05,249 --> 00:49:09,899
like the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> families to which Idris</font>

1078
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:12,269
family were in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop information</font>

1079
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:13,650
note this one the next hop must be of

1080
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:15,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address family so this</font>

1081
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:17,430
basically says where you're going to

1082
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:21,150
carry a v6 prefix the next hop address

1083
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:22,710
must be a v6 address and then nlr I of

1084
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:25,640
course is the fancy word for well

1085
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:28,259
destination I'm trying to get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

1086
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:31,230
and then the v6 specific extensions

1087
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:33,809
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've basically you have well the</font>

1088
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:35,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">next top address so you've got the sub</font>

1089
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:37,819

1091
00:49:37,819 --> 00:49:43,080
we've got sad i just wanted to

1092
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:45,210
for multicast RPF check submariners

1093
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:47,730
family<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for unicast and</font>

multicast and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forget what the label</font>

1095
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:54,720
means for some address<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally for rules</font>

1096
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:57,090
could strike to the next hop well when

1097
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">two peers share a common subnet the next</font>

1098

<font color="#E5E5E5">address and by the link local address</font>

1100
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:08,580
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to bear in mind mean</font>

1101
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">for v4 the next hop address was just the</font>

1102
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:13,170
global v4 address but v6 if it's on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1103
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:16,890
same subnet the next hop address

1104
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:22,980
includes both the v6 routable address as

1105
00:50:16,890 --> 00:50:26,368
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as this link local address there's</font>

00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,960
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> rib power protocol</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font>

1107
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:29,190
important remember get mean obviously

1108
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,200
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different address families</font>

1109
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:33,660
you'd expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be different routing</font>

1110
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:35,339
tables so the v4 routing table of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1111
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,500
vphone unicast routing table sits in one

1112
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:39,840
place to be six unique unicast routing

1113
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,300
table is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely separate thing and</font>

1114
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:44,640
you can ply different policies power

1115
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:47,160
protocol so if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got one set of</font>

1116
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:49,350
aggressive filters for v4 they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1117
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:51,149
automatically carried over into v6 you

1118
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:54,029
need to set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another set of aggressive</font>

1119
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:55,050
filters for v6 if you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so</font>

1120
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:57,390
again you know it's a bit like the

1121
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">security peace when you're enabling v6</font>

1122
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,779
on your router don't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> assume that</font>

1123
00:50:59,070 --> 00:51:03,060
well because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got nice for this in</font>

1124
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,560
v4 they're going to be carried over if

1125
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,900
you're setting up your bgp and you've

1126
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,759
got you know carefully crafted filters

1127
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:11,130
for your peers and transits and so forth

1128
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:12,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP v6</font>

1129
00:51:11,130 --> 00:51:15,270
peering you're going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to craft</font>

1130
00:51:12,810 --> 00:51:17,340
similar filters I mean again I've seen

1131
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:18,810
accidents happen where you know somebody

1135

done properly so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next type attribute</font>

1136
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,690
next top contains a global v6 address

1137
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:34,440
and it can contain a link local address

00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:37,080
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the link local address is you</font>

1142

that one more considerations<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beach be</font>

can be made over v4 or v6

1145
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:58,119
or both when there's no v4 configured on

1146
00:51:56,329 --> 00:52:01,869
the box you need to set your router ID

1147
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:04,700
again Roger of these the 32-bit integer

1148
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:06,529
you can come up with your own scheme for

1149
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:11,689
these study to bit integers as long as

1150

the unique in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network / router and</font>

1151
00:52:11,690 --> 00:52:15,289
it's needed really<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if you don't</font>

1152
00:52:13,339 --> 00:52:17,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the router ID</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then bgp basically</font>

1153

will not start and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go and try it</font>

1154
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:23,900
out on different routers if you wish to

1155
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:26,329
see what well doesn't happen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

config options for configuring bgp and

1157
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:30,680
this is usual thing if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and read</font>

1158
00:52:27,739 --> 00:52:32,599
the document documentation you can see

1159
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:34,910
excited people saying oh yeah he can run

1160
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:37,849
bgp between f dat addresses now isn't

1161
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:39,828
this cool well yes it is but bear in

1162
00:52:37,849 --> 00:52:42,499
mind that fe 80 address has come from

1163
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:44,180
your mac address and if the ethernet

1164
00:52:42,499 --> 00:52:46,038
card or whatever on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighboring</font>

1165
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,558
router changes the mac address changes

1166
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:51,380
and you get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new neighbor so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i really</font>

1167
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:53,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">dislike the fe 80 thing for bgp peering</font>

1168
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,279
at all that's why I having big red

1169
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:57,288
letters<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing not recommended because</font>

1170
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:58,819
well yes you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it but just because</font>

1171
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:01,369
you can do it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it the right</font>

1172
00:52:58,819 --> 00:53:06,019
thing to do use global unicast addresses

1173
00:53:01,369 --> 00:53:07,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean there are plenty of those so just</font>

1174
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:10,098
doing a regular peering here's an

1175
00:53:07,609 --> 00:53:13,489
example of a simple what is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> EBG p</font>

1176
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:16,249
peering now the first thing in iOS to

1177
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:19,309
note is this no bgp default IP v4

1178
00:53:16,249 --> 00:53:21,319
unicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean i'm on the v6 ops mailing</font>

1179
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:23,749
lists and basic users mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1180
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:26,660
few others and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i see people putting</font>

1181
00:53:23,749 --> 00:53:29,988
around iOS configurations with that one

1182
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:33,649
line missing now this one line basically

1183
00:53:29,989 --> 00:53:35,690
means well it disables ioss idea that

1184
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:38,869
every peer that you configure is going

1185
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:40,609
to be a v4 unique a spear<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay iOS</font>

1186
00:53:38,869 --> 00:53:42,680
default is basically if you configure a

1187
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:45,200
BGP neighbor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk I'd be</font>

1188
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:47,719
before unicast on this now if you're

1189
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:49,279
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set by a v6 only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Piron you</font>

1190
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:51,259
probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want the neighbor to try</font>

1191
00:53:49,279 --> 00:53:53,569
chattering v4 as well and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> miss</font>

1192
00:53:51,259 --> 00:53:55,609
this out you'll end up with if you look

1193
00:53:53,569 --> 00:53:59,569
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the v4 address-family you see appear</font>

1194
00:53:55,609 --> 00:54:02,630
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no negotiation flag sitting</font>

1195
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:04,519
on the on the on the show line and it

1196
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:05,090
just ends up making your show output

1197
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:07,370
look really

1198
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:08,810
I see you've got these configurations

1199
00:54:07,370 --> 00:54:11,529
hanging around there that really aren't

1200
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:14,750
much use and when you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1201
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:16,940
configuration that's generated from the

1202
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:18,710
router it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends up being</font>

1203
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:20,920
substantially bigger than it needs to be

1204
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:24,070
because you have the v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> address-family</font>

1205
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">having every single v6 neighbor as well</font>

1206
00:54:24,070 --> 00:54:30,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forget to do the no bgp</font>

1207
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:32,990
default IP v4 unicast now switches off

1208
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:37,640
the assumption in iOS that each peer is

1209
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:38,839
going to be a v4 unicast appeal and then

1210
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:41,299
of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the address family</font>

1211
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:42,860
peace so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font>

1212
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,260
changed if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> never touched v6 at</font>

1213
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:48,140
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp and iOS you're going to see that</font>

1214
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the configuration now changes and again</font>

1215
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know people do the shock horror of</font>

1216
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:53,299
woman goes what it's done because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1217
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:55,490
get neighbor configurations up top the

1218
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,500
generic stuff and then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get v4</font>

1219
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:59,600
configuration of e6 configuration as

1220
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:02,300
well show you in a piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> so here we've</font>

1221
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:04,370
got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> address time the ipv6 know does</font>

1222
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:06,410
the neighbor activate and this says this

1223
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:08,569
neighbor I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to activate for ipv6</font>

1224
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:10,220
address family and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put your</font>

1225
00:55:08,570 --> 00:55:13,490
network statement and all the usual

1226
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:15,649
stuff at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least you know the network</font>

1227
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:18,890
statement in v6 uses the modern /

1228
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:22,160
notation rather than doing 245 245 and

1229
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:24,650
so forth<font color="#CCCCCC"> link local peering I include</font>

1230
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:26,750
this just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how evil it can</font>

1231
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:28,670
look if you want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> link local</font>

1232
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:32,330
peering in v6 well there you go neighbor

1233
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:35,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">f v8</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a double column 263 FF 0 for 3</font>

1234
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:37,250
column 1 143 activate and if while if

1235
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,870
the neighbor neighboring router address

1236
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:41,240
changes then you have to go and

1237
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:43,700
reconfigure appearing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> no-wake you've</font>

1238
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:45,500
got to also fix the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop so you've</font>

1239
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,149
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route map that actually</font>

1240
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:48,410
fix the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop to real routable</font>

1241
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,210
address because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass</font>

1242
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:52,220
this prefix around within your backbone

1243
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:54,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">while this f v8 is of course only</font>

1244
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:56,569
visible on the link it's not visible

1245
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:59,450
across your entire backbone so you end

1246
00:55:56,570 --> 00:56:02,000
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with if if you don't do this you end</font>

1247
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:04,910
up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a classic ibgp error of</font>

1248
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,620
unreachable next hop so even though the

1249
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:09,049
peering comes up and you see prefixes

1250
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:11,270
none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them will be reachable at all so</font>

1251
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:14,200
really do not do this I should write on

1252
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:17,200
big letters example only do not do this

1253
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:19,040
okay you'll see configuration example

1254
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:24,919
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to do it with</font>

1255
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:28,820
link-local please don't in XR<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay XR is</font>

1256
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:31,040
different so first thing well we've got

1257
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:33,850
the router bgp we set the route ready by

1258
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:37,310
hand because that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to do</font>

1259
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:40,930
iOS XR like<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos has inbound outbound</font>

1260
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:44,180
policy type configurations like this

1261
00:56:40,930 --> 00:56:46,129
I've shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> here nice thing about XR I</font>

1262
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,020
think is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't actually set up</font>

1263
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:50,350
bitch p and have it working without

1264
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:52,880
specifying inbound and outbound policy

1265
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:55,100
you p no more people setting up router

1266
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,230
bgp blonde neighbor blah and getting

1267
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:59,210
full bgp table and sending fool bgp

1268
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,920
table<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to everybody else you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1269
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:04,490
have to sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think about some</font>

1270
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:08,180
policy so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is quite nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1271
00:57:04,490 --> 00:57:10,009
being a not really an exile user so

1272
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:11,690
we've got some example of right policy

1273
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:14,060
there and it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the right policy</font>

1274
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:15,860
language was pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> says well this</font>

1275
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:21,020
is my prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to announce it to</font>

1276
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:22,580
the neighbor looking on Juno's pretty

1277
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:26,750
similar idea were conflicting the

1278
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:29,420
dresses on interfaces were popping<font color="#CCCCCC"> a /</font>

1279
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:31,970
48 whatever it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is while we're setting it</font>

1280
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:33,920
up as a static route doing the router ID

1281
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:36,950
I know basically taking this static

1282
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:38,660
route and dropping it into bgp so again

1283
00:57:36,950 --> 00:57:43,460
if you familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> junos bgp</font>

1284
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:45,350
configuration pretty much all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1285
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:47,000
that's really happening here is the

1286
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:52,730
neighbor their specified as a v6

1287
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:55,970
neighbor and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're done so dual</font>

00:57:55,970 --> 00:58:00,830

1292
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,310
they set up a v6 configuration and the

1293
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:12,020
configuration file ends up looking

1294
00:58:10,310 --> 00:58:15,020
something like this ago oh my gosh it's

1295
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:17,509
broken it<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's happens what what</font>

1296
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:19,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually happens is when iOS goes multi</font>

1297
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:22,370

1300
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:28,970
address-family relevant stuff so things

1301
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,360
like filters<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got an inbound filter</font>

1307

statement there even though the neighbor

1308
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:43,160
has got a v4 address or maybe the

1309
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:45,230
neighbors got a v6 address with these

1310
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,629
neighbors you can still handle v four<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1311
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:50,090
these six prefixes and as you wish so

1312
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:52,340
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to specify what each neighbor</font>

1313
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:54,140
is going to actually handle then we've

1314
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:58,420
got the v6 address family which is then

1315
00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:01,069
being used to exchange v6 prefixes and

1316
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:02,600
I've got example of filters in here as

1317
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:05,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">well I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're familiar with the</font>

1318
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:07,430
IP prefix list for v4 while surprise

1319
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,400
surprise we've got ipv6 prefix lists for

1320
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:12,890
v6 and the form is the same we've got

1321
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,250
the usual ranging / notation and so

1322
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:18,620
forth one thing to note and I find this

1323
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:22,700
confuses people as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP prefix</font>

1324
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:24,589
list is not the same as an ipv6 prefix

1325
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:27,410
list you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same name</font>

1326
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:29,660
but where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use them as what matters</font>

1327
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:32,750
so if you use you see if you go into an

1328
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">v6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address family and specify a prefix</font>

1329
00:59:32,750 --> 00:59:37,760
filter that's only defined for v4 as far

1330
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:40,310
as iOS is concerned you have no prefix

1331
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,320
filter whatsoever don't fall into that

1332
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:44,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">trap this is why I've actually done in</font>

1333
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,550
this configuration I've actually put v6

1334
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:49,009
and v4 into the names of the prefix list

1335
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:51,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I find that as a useful visual reminder</font>

1336
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:53,870
that you're filtering v4 prefixes for v4

1337
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:56,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">pairings and v6 prefixes for these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">experience again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've just found this</font>

the v4<font color="#CCCCCC"> address-family</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network statement</font>

which address family the neighbor is

1348
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:22,790
going to walk run in so the 201 DB<font color="#E5E5E5"> 81</font>

1349
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:24,380

<font color="#E5E5E5">a dress family v6 we've got the right</font>

1351
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:30,350
policy that applies to it and then the

1352
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:32,359
neighbor 172 16 12 is sitting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4</font>

01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:37,310
family and has got that right policy as

1355
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:40,240
well I see the right policy for XR is a

1356
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:41,740
bit more and involved

1357
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,740
but it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much doing the same</font>

1358
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:47,740
thing as the previous example for iOS

1359
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:55,229
did so there's more configuration here

1360
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:58,750
not that's a full full piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay whoops</font>

1361
01:00:55,230 --> 01:01:01,750
jumping too far<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right so within</font>

1362
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:03,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jonas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again we set up the interface</font>

1363
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:05,650
addressing we'll look at the right while

1364
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:08,890
going to the routing options who have

1365
01:01:05,650 --> 01:01:11,260
set up our static route for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> laughs</font>

1366
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:14,020
32 basically punched into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the null of a</font>

1367
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:16,840
discard interface with Satar<font color="#E5E5E5"> outro d we</font>

1368
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:19,030
go into the routing protocols we've set

1369
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:25,240
ourselves up in a s10 we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> puing with a</font>

1370
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:27,430
US<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 that neighbors in 10 112 there's</font>

1371
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,560
no such concept as v6 or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Viva address</font>

1372
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:31,480
family were pretty much that was finally

1373
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:33,250
used as<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever the neighbor addresses</font>

1374
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:35,200
so the neighbors in v4 then it's a v4

1375
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:39,790
address family if enables in v6 and it's

1376
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:43,480
a v6 address family<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay manipulating</font>

1377
01:01:39,790 --> 01:01:46,990
attributes while in iOS if you custom to

1378
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:48,730
handling attributes for v4<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's well the</font>

1379
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:51,009
same way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for v6 mean if you notice there</font>

1380
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:52,630
there's a route map that basically sets

1381
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:54,880
a local preference now this route map

1382
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:56,680
could be used for v4 peering and can be

1383
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,280
used for a v6 peering because nothing in

1384
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:01,569
that right map is dependent on v4 or v6

1385
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,270
so there's an example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> just setting a</font>

1386
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:09,790
local pref on prefixes we hear from this

1388
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:19,779
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing an XR so again router is</font>

01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:34,509
from ps2 and got a right policy from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

1395
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:39,790
policy is pretty much setting local pref

1396
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:42,160
124 prefixes learned where's the right

1397
01:02:39,790 --> 01:02:44,140
policy from a s3 is pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much just</font>

1398
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:49,660
letting everything in without touching

1399
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:53,279
it with in junos again to slice to show

1400
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:57,220
this one so the router nice one

1401
01:02:53,279 --> 01:02:59,230
bgp configuration there we specify the

1402
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:03,609

again we're doing the predict the export

a certain local preference appropriate

peering now carrying v4 inside a v6

1413
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:34,390
peering you can do this in iOS if you

1414
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:37,329
want to you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> carry v4</font>

1416
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:42,190
with the rules the next top must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1417
01:03:39,670 --> 01:03:44,200
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> address family so what will</font>

1418
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:46,059
actually happen if you carry the v4

1419
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,220
prefixes they'll have a v6 next top

1420
01:03:46,059 --> 01:03:49,869
which of course is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not legal so when we</font>

1421
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:51,640
get the prefixes as you see in the last

1422
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:54,009
line there of the route map we have to

1423
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:56,950
fix the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next top to make it a v4 address</font>

1424
01:03:54,009 --> 01:03:59,109
so if you actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save I don't</font>

to peers to handle v4 and v6 prefixes

1429
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:12,839
you can just set up one peering over v6

1430
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:16,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport both your v4 and v6</font>

1436
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:31,749
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the particular RPL language</font>

works the other way around they can

1441
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:43,200
carry v6 prefixes and a v4 peering but

1442
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:48,759
cannot carry v4 prefixes and a v6 period

1443
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:51,069
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the status commands looking at</font>

you see the neighbor they actually learn

have long addresses then the line splits

1469
01:05:50,589 --> 01:05:54,819
messy and difficult to handle so you've

1470

conclusion about all that bgp been

extended to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple protocols</font>

1493
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:04,780
so v6 is but one more address fund in

1494
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:06,819
all this operators who are experienced

1495
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:09,100
with v for bgp should have no trouble

1496
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:11,050
adapting at all as

1497
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:13,240
is pretty much what you're accustomed to

1498
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:14,500
again depending on the type from you

<font color="#E5E5E5">up with reasonable addressing plans but</font>

1516
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:00,970
actually doing the writing protocol as

01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,590
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's a neighbor whether we're</font>

1518
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:04,660
typing numbers with colons<font color="#E5E5E5"> and numbers</font>

1519
01:08:02,590 --> 01:08:06,610

1520
01:08:04,660 --> 01:08:08,770
policies are all the same and so forth

1521
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:12,670
so suddenly as far as writing protocols

1522
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:17,500
go vb6 is basically v4 with really big

1523

addresses most organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font>

1524

1526
01:08:22,990 --> 01:08:29,050
anybody is going to just go v6 pure for

1527
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:31,420
many years yet so it's simply a case of

1528
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:35,020
just adding v6 functionality to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

the other implementations you want to

Richard a steamer get in there so we

01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:36,130
workaround for that is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure a</font>

1553
01:09:32,908 --> 01:09:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">Juniper v6 alias that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is colon colon</font>

1554
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:44,949
your before address<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and one other</font>

1555
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:46,959
comments what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use for number which i</font>

1556
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:49,538
think has worked really well for v6 is

1557
01:09:46,959 --> 01:09:52,179
to take the v4 address so say for

1558
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:53,799
example you've got you've got a 32 or

1559
01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:57,189
whatever you've got from her<font color="#CCCCCC"> mariner</font>

1560
01:09:53,799 --> 01:09:59,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">weather so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take like our 2001 calling</font>

1561
01:09:57,189 --> 01:10:02,800
by binding colon colon and then you put

1562
01:09:59,769 --> 01:10:06,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">the v4 address in and then you do /</font>

1563
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,599
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4 mask would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be plus 96 so</font>

1564
01:10:06,099 --> 01:10:11,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally you're just mapping your reef</font>

1565
01:10:07,599 --> 01:10:13,510
or address into X and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the v6 and the</font>

1566
01:10:11,530 --> 01:10:15,938
trick for this is anywhere that you

1567
01:10:13,510 --> 01:10:17,350
already have before you don't have to

1568
01:10:15,939 --> 01:10:19,270
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about allocating you don't</font>

1569
01:10:17,350 --> 01:10:21,310
update your tools you can just copy your

1570
01:10:19,270 --> 01:10:23,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS settings right reverse all your DNS</font>

1571
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:24,910
and b6 magically works it's really

1572
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:26,590
really convenient

1573
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:29,320
as long as you're running<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will stack</font>

1574
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:31,780
before v6 highly recommend people do

1575
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:34,290
that it just saves so much grief that's

1576
01:10:31,780 --> 01:10:41,530
a really good tip yeah thanks Richard

1577
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:43,030
fill your voice<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kim from there talking a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">big time from texting communications</font>

1579
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:48,969
talking about is is multi topology have

1580
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:53,890
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked with anybody who's done v6</font>

1581
01:10:48,970 --> 01:10:56,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">role lab using is is yes because we ran</font>

1582
01:10:53,890 --> 01:10:58,810
into horrendous problems and it may have

1583
01:10:56,050 --> 01:11:00,460
simply been that maybe step<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is run</font>

1584
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:04,630
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all your routers and drop in</font>

1585
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:06,430
multi toko ok because when we went to

1586
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:08,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">our first router and set the overlook</font>

1587
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:11,530
big push it out affording back and the

1588
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:13,960
moment I try to enable is is on the

1589
01:11:11,530 --> 01:11:16,750
loopback that router fell off the face

1590
01:11:13,960 --> 01:11:18,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the network v4 and v6 well the ones</font>

1591
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:19,510
I've worked without to check and see

1592
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,340
whether they're doing multi topology or

1593
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:23,200
not as suspect not because i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1594
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:25,990
ruled out<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack everywhere so i</font>

1595
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:30,580
would check as soon as though my as i

1596
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:33,670
said your topologies don't agree oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1597
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:35,890
and blew up that box I mean though and

1598
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">you reload in 20 was a nice rescue as</font>

1599
01:11:35,890 --> 01:11:42,430
was console access yep yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's a</font>

1600
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:46,280
transition mode for

1601
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:48,650
so Cisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> olam to see if both the</font>

1602
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:52,400
neighbors<font color="#CCCCCC"> were speaking more than a</font>

1603
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:54,019
holiday or not or single ecology and you

1604
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,700
can disable out check by carrying on the

1605
01:11:54,020 --> 01:11:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition let's go to four actually</font>

1606
01:11:55,700 --> 01:12:00,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't do that Jack so there's no need</font>

1607
01:11:57,230 --> 01:12:06,440
to do a transition mode but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1608
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:07,910
will keep your your is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dietitian but I</font>

1609
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:12,169
didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> my loopback had any</font>

1610
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:15,200
neighbors and the moment I stuck my sis

1611
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:16,550
I'm gonna look back right but it's been

1612
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:19,700
a while it's been a few years since I

1613
01:12:16,550 --> 01:12:21,980
did this but I believe once you put on

1614
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:26,710
v6 on handing the face on that powder

1615
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:30,860
then start sending the v6 in the in the

1616
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:35,540
ice is<font color="#CCCCCC"> alvays and so all your browser</font>

1617
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:37,370
Don unexpectable puke on<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so it's my</font>

1618
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:38,910
and it's been a couple years but but

1619
01:12:37,370 --> 01:12:41,430
there is that transition

1620
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:42,780
that will system admin so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1621
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:44,760
go when you turn you put on the

1622
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:46,530
transition<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote on everything get</font>

1623
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything up to multi topology and then</font>

1624
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:51,690
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back in and back out the church yeah</font>

1625
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:54,960
we went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to plan B which was to actually</font>

1626
01:12:51,690 --> 01:12:58,169
roll back to ospf but we had other

1627
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:00,570
driving reasons behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah yeah not to</font>

1628
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:02,010
be the transition keyboard that I've put

1629
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:04,590
in the bullet they're not actually

1630
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:11,940
mentioned winter again I think that's

1631
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:14,580
what that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay hi christian</font>

1632
01:13:11,940 --> 01:13:16,320
university of arizona if we're at the

1633
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:19,440
point of just getting ready to roll<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

1634
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:21,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">our ipv6 and with the understanding that</font>

1635
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,179
we only need to run it on cisco boxers

1636
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:26,520
eigrp<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like it's by far the easiest</font>

1637
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up is there any reason that I</font>

1638
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:31,860
would run a serious look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1639
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:33,540
something other than that my<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp what do</font>

1640
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:36,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">you recommend as well swing collection</font>

1641
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:40,650
if you're using eigrp at the moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1642
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:42,600
would say why change but you know the

1643
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:45,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty people in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the audience who</font>

1644
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:48,810
use ospf and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> osias for various reasons</font>

1645
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:50,820
and probably good reasons so may I know

1646
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:53,490
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have actually moved from ospf to</font>

1647
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:55,170
is is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they can deploy ipv6 for</font>

1648
01:13:53,490 --> 01:13:57,420
example and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've known people have moved</font>

1649
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:59,670
from eigrp because<font color="#CCCCCC"> ER GOP came very late</font>

1650
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:03,450
to the game with with v6 supports like

1651
01:13:59,670 --> 01:14:06,240
only what three years two years now so

1652
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:08,070
it's been pretty late but I don't know I

1653
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:10,679
tend to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need your comfortable</font>

1654
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:12,840
the igrp it's not broken so I don't

1655
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:14,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's any need to fix it but you</font>

1656
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:17,460
know they've been plenty good tutorials

1657
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:20,280
here about merits of ospf is I so if you

1658
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:21,780
want to consider changing completely I'd

1659
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather look at that I don't want to get</font>

1660
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a which is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bad sir so but in a GP</font>

1661
01:14:26,910 --> 01:14:30,410
should work just fine if that's what you

1662
01:14:28,290 --> 01:14:30,410
have

1663
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:41,339
thanks for the wonderful presentation I

1664
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:44,100
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've cisco has this is x XE</font>

1665
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:47,330
also that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's follow the same v6</font>

1666
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:51,179
pattern what we have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in exile</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1667
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:53,570
don't know i might get quote this wrong

1668
01:14:51,179 --> 01:14:56,820
i believe iOS XE would look like iOS

1669
01:14:53,570 --> 01:14:59,369
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't had</font>

1670
01:14:56,820 --> 01:15:02,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">a chance to play with it yet and same</font>

1671
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:05,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nexus switch and exos I don't know</font>

1672
01:15:02,639 --> 01:15:08,219
what it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they're either so</font>

1673
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:10,909
next time I do this I'll try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get</font>

1674
01:15:08,219 --> 01:15:10,909
that all updated

1675

Dwight<font color="#E5E5E5"> earnest room rnk communications</font>

1676
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:26,720
if I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of 723 bees deployed</font>

1677
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:31,790
and I'm close to my I'm close to my 239

1678
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:37,160
k route ipv4 unicast limit and I deploy

1679
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:38,990
a significant ipv6 rib is that going to

1680
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:41,389
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> up resources and that too in that</font>

1681
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:46,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">same pool or is it a separate rule if</font>

1682
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:48,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll use up from that pool I mean what</font>

1683
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:51,530
they're about who depends where you look

1684
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:53,960
at about 1,500 prefixes and v6 so we

1685
01:15:51,530 --> 01:15:57,080
added about 800 in the last year or so

1686
01:15:53,960 --> 01:16:00,470
so I'd expect that number to go up a bit

1687
01:15:57,080 --> 01:16:02,210
quicker now so yeah I'm sorry it's what

1688
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:03,920
was talked about earlier on today about

1689
01:16:02,210 --> 01:16:06,380
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and reduce the number and</font>

1690
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">there to maintain that hardware I mean</font>

1691
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:09,320
yeah you can go and speak to your

1692
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:12,559
friendly sales guy he'll be delighted to

1693
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:14,929
sell you something bigger but I have I

1694
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,880
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know it makes more sense to</font>

1695
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:19,790
try and get existing keep existing

1696
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:22,400
functionality and so forth so I mean

1697
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:25,790
yeah without going into a rant trying to

1698
01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:27,559
pair away about the sixty one fifty five

1699
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:28,880
percent of prefixes the really don't

1700
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:38,050
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be there is probably a good</font>

1701
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:38,050
policy first new other questions

1702
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:41,160
yep

1703
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:47,670
back to the issue with the 720 bees and

1704
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:49,558
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be incorrect on this but</font>

1705
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:51,329
you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the ipv4 in the ipv6</font>

1706
01:16:49,559 --> 01:16:53,880
table share the same memory and other

1707
01:16:51,329 --> 01:16:55,799
limitations yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seems to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font>

1708
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:57,570
there was several years ago we ran into

1709
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,219
the issue with the 720 be he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not being</font>

1710
01:16:57,570 --> 01:17:00,808
able to carry the full route table and

1711
01:16:59,219 --> 01:17:04,500
one of the workaround is that to

1712
01:17:00,809 --> 01:17:07,170
actually steal memory space from the

1713
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:09,059
ipv6 where that can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> six was held in</font>

1714
01:17:07,170 --> 01:17:12,059
order to increase what you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1715
01:17:09,059 --> 01:17:13,590
any ipv4 as a temporary workaround which

1716
01:17:12,059 --> 01:17:17,309
leads<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe they're in separate</font>

1717
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:19,380
memory spaces testing my knowledge on

1718
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:21,090
the on the three be up you can answer

1719
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:23,219
rich<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that please yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can answer</font>

1720
01:17:21,090 --> 01:17:25,559
that so it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea can but you</font>

1721
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:28,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">can statically configured where it gets</font>

1722
01:17:25,559 --> 01:17:30,480
allocated and keep in mind that v6

1723
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:33,360
addresses so an ipv4 address it goes

1724
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:36,808
into a 72 bit tkm entry a v6 address

1725
01:17:33,360 --> 01:17:39,150
goes into a 144 bid so every v6 are all

1726
01:17:36,809 --> 01:17:42,809
accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> for double what if you for rel</font>

1727
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:46,730
does but yes there's actually a finite

1728
01:17:42,809 --> 01:17:46,730
space and it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you chop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it up</font>

1729
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:54,209
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions</font>

1730
01:17:55,990 --> 01:18:03,820
if not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh joel is coming to the mic yeah</font>

1731
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:05,350
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of the amount of cam space</font>

1732
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:07,000
you actually need for your receipts for

1733
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:11,890
outs of the moment there's only like a

1734
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,980
1400 of them so the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> young you</font>

1735
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:16,630
don't have much space doesn't

1736
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:19,179
necessarily impact you you'll still be

1737
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:25,690
stealing space in your v6 cam for a

1738
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:27,910
while for reform yep um you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

1739
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:31,780
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to doubled in size over two years</font>

1740
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:35,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the before one does if not</font>

1741
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:39,130
faster but you know that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5,000</font>

1742
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:40,510
well I mean the v6 table showed what

1743
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:42,310
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting on for by eighty percent</font>

1744
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:45,400
growth in a year which i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1745
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:47,710
v4 one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> every time this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the least</font>

1746
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,540
as a percentage percentage basis the

1747
01:18:47,710 --> 01:18:51,850
beezies<font color="#CCCCCC"> table is growing faster than the</font>

1748
01:18:49,540 --> 01:18:58,150
v4 table it's just obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

1749
01:18:51,850 --> 01:19:00,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">with smaller guys yep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1750
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:04,750
