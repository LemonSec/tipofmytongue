thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you dr. Roberts we have</font>

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,500
michael shields from google who's been

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:22,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Vijay on a favourite topic</font>

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:24,689
of theirs we have right here I change

5
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:30,560
the signs<font color="#E5E5E5"> around some you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay do</font>

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">your friend you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just drink here we go</font>

7
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:58,309
just try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slide that in next left</font>

8
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:58,309
fit

9
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,740
nothing yet

10
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,560
that's better<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

11
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font>

12
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,399
so what I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about today is</font>

13
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,200
automated network configuration I think

14
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this is a problem that every</font>

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">network I've worked at is hat and it's</font>

16
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,590
problem that I think is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it is</font>

17
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,240
endemic I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not possible to</font>

18
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:49,220
just be careful and have everything

19
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,780
correct without tools because I think

20
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> humans are just</font>

21
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,590
fundamentally not good at but the good

22
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,179
news is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found some general</font>

23
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,120
principles and some approaches that can

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:00,080
help solve that you know I know

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,870
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the classes of tools that are</font>

26
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:04,039
necessary and more importantly how you

27
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,480
can get there from the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,680
already have because no<font color="#E5E5E5"> one's going to</font>

29
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,810
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and rebuild your network from</font>

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,520
scratch using the automated you know

31
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,050
system that you now think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

32
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,760
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had I know that a lot of</font>

33
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,290
people wish to do that but they're just

34
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,359
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get there from here and</font>

35
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:19,010
I've done that<font color="#E5E5E5"> successfully in you know</font>

36
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
in a few areas so that's what this talk

37
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:24,500
is about so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traditional way</font>

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to take your small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network and make it a</font>

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,650
little bigger I mean you buy equipment

40
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,790
you put it in place and you log on the

41
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,140
device and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font>

42
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,370
and you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your documentation you</font>

43
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,200
look at some previous configs that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

44
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:35,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">done about the same thing and you cut</font>

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,350
and paste and you you know turn around

46
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:37,459
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have someone else check your work</font>

47
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">and make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you haven't made any you</font>

48
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,610
know any mistakes you know the same

49
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,650
usual sorts of typos that we see over

50
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,090
and over and then you know you go and

51
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,500
commit everything and you turn up the

52
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,600
monitoring and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you move on you think</font>

53
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,830
everything's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,120
you're right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we're all</font>

55
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,950
smart people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're careful people</font>

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,959
and you know generally everything works

57
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:55,700
out but it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen every time it</font>

58
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,350
only happens most of the time and the

59
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,179
times that it doesn't happen are really

60
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:00,739
frustrating and it's something that

61
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:02,209
seems to come up more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> often</font>

62
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:04,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">when you have something which is a</font>

63
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,410
network-wide impact a good example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

64
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:08,180
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibgp configurations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need a</font>

65
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:10,430
full match if something is missing from

66
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:13,160
that then you get random mystery black

67
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:15,950
holing it's a it's really unpleasant to

68
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,880
bug and you find it you wish you wish

69
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,109
the problem had been something else

70
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it just completely wasted your</font>

71
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,600
time so here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just</font>

72
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,440
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a case study this is</font>

73
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,000
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the simplest possible</font>

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,350
configurations you have to router setup

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,880
and never done the<font color="#E5E5E5"> parent you to save me</font>

76
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,989
behind them and you have some servers or

77
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,390
it's a Colo customer or you know

78
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:35,390
whatever it is it's as simple as I guess

79
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,440
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know networking 101 so you</font>

80
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:37,730
have a template you know you've done

81
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">this plenty of time so you just you know</font>

82
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:40,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">no you won</font>

83
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">plugging in you know the interface and</font>

84
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,140
near the address and make one router<font color="#CCCCCC"> 120</font>

85
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">4100 cetera et cetera it's no problem</font>

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">you plug it in it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you copy it</font>

87
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,790
kind of paste<font color="#CCCCCC"> the yellow router you</font>

88
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,590
change the things around you pay some

89
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,769
that router everything looks fine I mean

90
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,879
same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing it always is and</font>

91
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,080
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't notice this time is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

92
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,640
actually something is wrong you feeling

both<font color="#CCCCCC"> reddits the same IP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address because</font>

fix it's the same just simple sort of

98
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,989
mistake that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> inevitable it happens</font>

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,730
because people<font color="#E5E5E5"> come and pay people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cut</font>

100
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,720

101
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">documentation because it's more</font>

102
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,389
convenient but look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can fake</font>

103
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:20,400
somewhere else than it is to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

104
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">find the official procedure for what it</font>

105
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that will if you have some sort of an</font>

106
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,880
error or if it's a one-off config that

107
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,139
was deliberately different than you know

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,610
you'll see that propagate elsewhere

109
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:32,550
network and sometimes you can see that

<font color="#CCCCCC">course you don't notice that until</font>

115
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:45,120
monitoring fails but humans expect to

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,240
see patterns people expect everything to

117
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,289
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it almost always is and</font>

they'll see things that aren't there I

119
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,830
mean you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at something and if a</font>

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,239
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are you know if you're</font>

them of the sand the odds are very good

123
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,220
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not notice the one that isn't</font>

124
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,030
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that is going to</font>

catch you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one that's</font>

you're not going to find all the errors

128
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in less you spend an</font>

129
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,580
interminable amount of time doing that

130
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,160
so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the most common things that</font>

131
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">go wrong you know I've seen it over and</font>

132
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:15,000
over some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these are pretty insidious</font>

133
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,349
the apples especially because that's

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,180
something that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are likely not to</font>

135
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,289
notice until you see the packets and get

136
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,820
the track them back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to somewhere where</font>

137
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:23,880
they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have been able to come</font>

138
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,020
from IP address confusion is another

139
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,669
good one because that's something where

140
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,349

crop up there in that general field and

simple responsive people have is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

146
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,690
you do it Bell System style where you

147
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:41,110
know you you have someone you know punch

148

down the wire and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have some</font>

and you know writing the book and

150
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,710
someone make sure that you know the

the book against what's in the patch

consistent there's always going to be

161
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,060
some level of errors and you'll go blind

162
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:05,200
trying I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just you'll spend all</font>

163
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,550
your time thinking about the individual

168
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,070
your network is small then it doesn't

170
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,849
everything is that hot and just look at

171
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,500
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you know when you have even a few</font>

172
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,180

173
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,560
unmanageable the more actions you take

174
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,970
the more mistake you make in any large

thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual actions because</font>

177
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,710
you have to configure everything

individually if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not automated of</font>

00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,460
with less effort they'll scale with

00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:38,590
higher up time I mean Neil scale with

183
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,090
more interested engineers because their

184
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,710
job will be and will be better I mean

185
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,909
they'll not spend so much time tracing

186
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,890
down problems that turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

187
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,470
fundamentally fundamentally silly and

188
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,719
just random errors just<font color="#E5E5E5"> random typos I</font>

189
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,800
mean it's it's frustrating when the root

190
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,130
cause of your problem turns out to be

191
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,770
gentle<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a typo it's much better when</font>

192
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can blame it on vendors so everyone</font>

193
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:00,190
wants an orderly network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

194
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,020
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you already have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a network so</font>

195
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,300
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out how to get there</font>

196
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">from here there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple ways you can do</font>

197
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,270
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean one way that people commonly</font>

198
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:08,830
take is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll take an individual</font>

199
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,090
router and they'll start trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write</font>

200
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,469
a generator the alternate that config

201
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,719
and they'll figure Oh changes from here

202
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:16,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">on I'll have to go through the generator</font>

203
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,160
it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work because you know you</font>

204
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,330
basically have to because the nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

205
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,190
network is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're tied into it</font>

206
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,020
into everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so there's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

207
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:25,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to slice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it based on one router you have</font>

208
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,010
to slice it across like you solve one

209
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:29,409
class of problems so you can solve the

210
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem of duplicate IP addresses or of</font>

211
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:33,160
incomplete bgp ibgp mesh or whatever

212
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,750
there are other class<font color="#E5E5E5"> of problems that</font>

213
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve but you have to pick</font>

214
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">one and slice it across</font>

215
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,039
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that works is that you know</font>

216
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,570
you have a template like the example I

217
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,120
had before<font color="#E5E5E5"> except that it's fully</font>

218
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,620
automated so you go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put the</font>

219
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,510
config that you want into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a database and</font>

220
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">then the configure it falls out of that</font>

221
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,020
I mean it tells you you know apply this

222
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,370
to the router an important step is that

223
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,169
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back any time you want</font>

224
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,610
and check that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what did</font>

225
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:58,960
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a flight on the router and you can</font>

226
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:00,699
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a continuous basis and find</font>

227
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,650
all the cases where that did or<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't</font>

228
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">happen and it forces you to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document the</font>

229
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,219
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you did something on an ad</font>

230
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,660
hoc basis that way anytime something is

231
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,220
different you know whether it was

232
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:11,320
something that was a deliberate decision

233
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,639
which happens or whether it was

234
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,340
something that was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mistake which</font>

235
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,419
also happens but this way you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

236
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,229
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> wandering and particularly</font>

237
00:08:16,419 --> 00:08:20,620
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> wandering at two in the</font>

238
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:21,639
morning so the policy here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

239
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,530
touch the router and tell us in the

240
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,729
database for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you know we</font>

241
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:26,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have had it by just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> defining the</font>

242
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,789
right you know by defining in the

243
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,080
database right now I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending up a new</font>

244
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:32,289
Ethernet segment and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

245
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,819
this pair of routers and from there you

246
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:36,880
then have a database<font color="#CCCCCC"> of all the all the</font>

247
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,930
addresses that you've set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way so</font>

248
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,189
that way you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

249
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:40,929
scrape your router can face you can

250
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,520
parse them and you can make sure that

251
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:46,300
everything that's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

252
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:47,800
in the database so you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

253
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,599
pile of writers and you start putting

254
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,329
information into your<font color="#E5E5E5"> database this is</font>

255
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,320
the step that this is step one because

256
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,700
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with an empty database</font>

257
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,140
so you go through and you write

258
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,360
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll scrape everything put</font>

259
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,650
it into there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you do that it</font>

260
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,450
immediately gets more and more useful

261
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,650
because you can also go back now and you

262
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,790
can query<font color="#E5E5E5"> the database you don't have to</font>

263
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,110
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through all your router's looking for</font>

264
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,520
something you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to actually log</font>

265
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:08,230
in and do Trace routes or look at your

266
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,730
writing table you just go right here and

267
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,080
you can't I enjoy other tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

268
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,670
ticketing system kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hot links to it</font>

269
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,800
or you know whatever whatever systems

270
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:16,209
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in place you know just go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

271
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,029
tie them right in it never has actually

272
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:20,170
talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the live network to do so once</font>

273
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,700
you've done that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can start actually</font>

274
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,099
applying the configs from the database

275
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,360
now it's up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you whether you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

276
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that automatically or not or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font>

277
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,600
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have humans review it first</font>

278
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,250
or whether you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had do</font>

279
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,660
manual pushes but you know without

280
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,950
review it's it's your own risk

281
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,319
assessment no matter what part of thing

282
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:37,020
fig that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know that</font>

283
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,730
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to push out at that point</font>

284
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,949
but once you know that that session in

285
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,480
fig is always supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be by policy</font>

286
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:45,670
correctly generated from the database

287
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,750
then you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any time that what</font>

288
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,520
the database says it's different from

289
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the router config is an error in either</font>

290
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,270
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router for the day</font>

291
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,380
and you can set up an alarm and someone

292
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,819
can go look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it so here's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

293
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,050
the audit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could have had that</font>

294
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have caught this problem right</font>

295
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,599
away before anyone noticed it would have

296
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,240
called you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know caught it right there at</font>

297
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,950
turn up so there's a couple reasons that

298
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,000
you'll start seeing errors you know once

299
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,360
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> start putting things into the</font>

300
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,890
database number one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your router</font>

301
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,690
parser code didn't correctly figure out

302
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,830
what your what your<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases work that's an</font>

303
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,880
easy problem to fix you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

304
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:18,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then rerun the importer</font>

305
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,110
number two is after configuration errors

306
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,250
these are surprisingly common even<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

307
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,780
things like assigning the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

308
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:26,310
address to multiple interfaces I mean

309
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,620
typically if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go through and sweep</font>

310
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,880
that you'll find you know you can find

311
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,990
dozens<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases where someone has put</font>

312
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,120
the same IP address and two interfaces

313
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,100
no one has noticed maybe four months or

314
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,410
years I mean it's amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can go on</font>

315
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,610
but it actually does I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> our networks</font>

316
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,890
are large enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> and have enough corners</font>

317
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,240
that that really can't happen and you

318
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,160
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is every</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network I've worked</font>

319
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">out here is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a Google</font>

320
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,850
specific talk and the third case here is

321
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,349
deliberately an usual configuration

322
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,090
these you'll find a lot of cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

323
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,820
someone will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something which is</font>

324
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,690
just almost the same as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a center config</font>

325
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,770
and they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go and they'll just</font>

326
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,990
configure it that way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

327
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:59,250
works and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's great but problem is</font>

328
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you never went back and wrote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

329
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,500
this is the standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that I can</font>

330
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,570
figure something which is slightly

331
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">different or you didn't write down for</font>

332
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,450
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> X they're almost the same you</font>

333
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,210
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> except it's slightly different this</font>

334
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:10,470
way now this way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it either</font>

335
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,000
a standard config<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone you can</font>

336
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,580
make anyone offering<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

337
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,960
them but whichever way you choose it's

338
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:20,370
an explicit decision and it's something

339
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have recorded so it's important</font>

340
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to go back and recheck it at</font>

341
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,440
will so it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that</font>

342
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,000
you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to go at any time and</font>

343
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,170
take what you have generated and what

344
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,850
you have on the answer router and put

345
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,560
them side by side and figure out having

346
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">differ if at all and you need be able to</font>

347
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,739
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

348
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">intentionally say this is something that</font>

349
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,160
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore and put it in a door</font>

350
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,420
for it or it's something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

351
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,680
you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and fix these</font>

352
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,890
those router or the database based on

353
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,050
which one of them is incorrect so this

354
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,250
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example of an actual audit it</font>

355
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,199
doesn't take a lot to build a system

356
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:50,940
like this what you need is a you need a

357
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,680
database and you'll need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a templating</font>

358
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,279
system it can be any templating system

359
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,420
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable with and</font>

360
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:57,009
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone differently work with</font>

361
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">this comfort with as long as it has</font>

362
00:11:57,009 --> 00:12:00,910
loops and conditionals then that's

363
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,160
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the way this the</font>

364
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,089
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system works it goes</font>

365
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,459
through pull things out of the database

366
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> generates a text config and the</font>

367
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,790
important operator here is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ellipsis</font>

368
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,870
the ellipsis is not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've just</font>

369
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,459
put on the saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideal what's this is</font>

370
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,459
actually part of the audit the ellipsis

371
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:17,050
is something that is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ellipsis an</font>

372
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:18,959
operator that matches any text which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

373
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:22,779
at an equal or greater invitation level

374
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:24,008
so what this says here is that you know

375
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:25,660
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocols we can have any</font>

376
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,420
number of protocols but there's you know

377
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:31,059
the ospf section can be before or after

378
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:32,769
that or there can be anything before or

379
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:35,110
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US PF section but within the</font>

380
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:36,490
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interface for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

381
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:41,470
you can do on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is apply metric you</font>

382
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:42,639
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly anything else so your onyx</font>

383
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,809
don't have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this necessarily</font>

384
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably look in this</font>

385
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:47,740
general form basically the idea is that

386
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,910
you generate something and you can

387
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">compare it against it and you'll need</font>

388
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,449
some way of selecting what part of the

389
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:54,279
config that you're comparing it against

390
00:12:52,449 --> 00:12:55,899
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily productive to try</font>

391
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,670
to compare complete configurations until

392
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:59,860
you're really far along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I've</font>

393
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,839
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> it once before it results in</font>

394
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,980
people getting used to seeing gifts you

395
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,209
don't want people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get used to seeing</font>

396
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,009
gives you want people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get used to</font>

397
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,719
saying is seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> them everything is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

398
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:09,490
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exactly in line with how</font>

399
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,209
we expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be so that's why you need</font>

400
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,170
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at just part of the</font>

401
00:13:10,209 --> 00:13:16,180
configuration at a time so the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

402
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,719
really pays off is when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to make</font>

403
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">a sweeping network-wide change so the</font>

404
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">way you know generally that becomes a</font>

405
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,620
giant you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> John a project it</font>

406
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,939
takes you know the bulk of the year

407
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,860
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to go on right configs</font>

408
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're kind of you know on pins and</font>

412
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,500
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> each individual router or they're</font>

413
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,610
changing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one vendor to another</font>

414
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,139
because no one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sure if they</font>

415
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,929
got a correct I mean it's a there's a

416
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot that can go wrong but if what the</font>

417
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:44,559
change are making is women within the

418
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:46,569
scope of what you find then all you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

419
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,089
is you add what's new to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> database</font>

420
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:50,229
and you till you tell the generator how

421
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,300
to generate the new sections of the

422
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,920
configuration so here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

423
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,449
you've just added all Diaz is sections

424
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,699
and you own your plot that every router

425
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:59,459
you swap the metrics around you probably

426
00:13:57,699 --> 00:14:02,229
seem to talk on how did this before and

427
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:03,489
there you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're done and you know</font>

428
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,880
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that was done without</font>

429
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,770
having to sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and look at every</font>

430
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,420
vidual router this is the things that

431
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,220
you're now looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the level of</font>

432
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,420
network you can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and operate at the</font>

433
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,400
level the network and you can make

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">network-wide changes you're not always</font>

435
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,370
sitting down looking at each individual

436
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,440
detail you're not sitting down with the

437

<font color="#E5E5E5">poking that the punch tool trying to</font>

438
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,800
figure out that everything is correct so

439
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:26,810
in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your router /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> patient</font>

440
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,939
is no longer just a log it's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font>

441
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:31,310
just the it's no longer to the

442
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,050
accumulated a set of changes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that people</font>

443
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:34,910
have made to it it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a function</font>

444
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:36,500
that you can apply to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> database you</font>

445
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,880
take the database input you apply a

446
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,320
function to it and then you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

447
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have is what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compare is not to</font>

448
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,960
be and if you change what your

449
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,730
architecture is you just define a new

450
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,440
function f prime you<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan it to the same</font>

451
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:46,490
data and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> something which is what</font>

452
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:51,320
the new configuration ought to be and

453
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:53,120
you can go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply that so the one</font>

454
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,040
wrench in this is what do you do about

455
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-offs there's always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be some</font>

456
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are just really really weird</font>

457
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,770
there are two ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to approach that one</font>

458
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,090
way is to just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to ignore</font>

459
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,560
this section thing fake and that's a

460
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:05,300
that's a perfectly valid approach I mean

461
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,550
it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> silent it's like silence in the</font>

462
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,870
alert assignments<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the alarms it says</font>

463
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,819
you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same as a</font>

464
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,050
standard config but I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to forget</font>

465
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,670
about it because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an odd Center</font>

466
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:15,800
config the other thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do that's</font>

467
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,089
better is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat yourself even</font>

468
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,329
internally is if you were a coma

469
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,220
provider and define an architecture for

470
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,810
isolating things in such a way that they

471
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,490
can't harm the rest of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network no</font>

472
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,780
matter what weird things they do this is

473
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,950
really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for acquisitions if you have</font>

474
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,449
a company that you bought you having a

475
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,830
similar to the network get then you can

476
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,450
go and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have something</font>

477
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">already you can pull off the shelf and</font>

478
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,120
just put them behind this<font color="#E5E5E5"> jail router</font>

479
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:36,949
and then you know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

480
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,210
you know the you don't have to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

481
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,050
worry about what sort of weird one off

482
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,680
you're going to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them you've</font>

483
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:44,209
treated them like a coma customer so

484
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,969
that's a summary is that anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

485
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:48,110
you do routinely is something that you

486
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:49,610
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start sitting around right run</font>

487
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:50,930
an audit if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

488
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:54,050
higher level of accuracy than you can

489
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,400
get by hand it's a few whether you want

490
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,260
the high-level accuracy if you're happy

491
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the amount of work that you do</font>

492
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,069
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level of accuracy</font>

493
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:02,270
that you currently get then there's no

494
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:03,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to do this but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's a</font>

495
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of benefits of doing so and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

496
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,850
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only way to get beyond the</font>

497
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,160
level you can have by hand the way to

498
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,950
get there from not having it is to start

499
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">with one class of problems at a time</font>

500
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:17,360
it seems like IP allocation would be

501
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:19,250
there but it often is often often you

502
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,260
know the problem then I need an idea IP

503
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,970
allocation database is just right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

504
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,520
at some places so I'll be checking that

505
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,960
some languages it doesn't tie into

506
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,160
anything so as long as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

507
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">database of routers you can pretty much</font>

508
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,089
generate that almost everyone can start

509
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,860
with the rbtv match you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> compete</font>

510
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:35,240
to continuously can<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair comparative</font>

511
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:37,130
generating a pig's against the Athletics

512
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,510
and you want to get the dips down to

513
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,100
zero you want to get that<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to point</font>

514
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,100
where everyone is used to seeing it all

515
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,050
line up and if you can if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you</font>

516
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,070
know for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware do so the best way</font>

517
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,569
to isolate the non standard

518
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:51,560
configurations is to treat them as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colo</font>

519
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">customers and then make a jail there so</font>

520
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,290
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all something small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network need</font>

521
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:55,370
is in a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you don't do</font>

522
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,660
things routine what you don't do things

523
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,130
hundreds of thousands tens of thousands

524
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,040
of times you do sent you know you do

525
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:02,240
things as they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and it's</font>

526
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,520
surprising how far you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get with that</font>

527
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,839
but the big ones do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean</font>

528
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,310
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that basically humans</font>

529
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,770
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at and that computers are</font>

530
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:13,220
good at and I think we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> all do more</font>

531
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:14,660
of it if we have more experience with it

532
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:16,459
if we had more experience with being

533
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to get to that point from the point</font>

534
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,329
where the variation is just the

535
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,000
accumulated you know just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

536
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,290
changes it more have made there's no way

537
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,150
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it with a fight day because</font>

538
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's you'll have to generate a complete</font>

539
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,720
config and then cut it over and they all

540
00:17:27,709 --> 00:17:30,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to worry about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and your project</font>

541
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,980
will never actually get at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

542
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,060
it's like any self-rejection the

543
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,800
smallest thing that can make progress

544
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and start implementing that and get</font>

545
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:41,379
people used to ending its and feedback

546
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:41,380
on it and then start rolling it out

547
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,950
that's it I know we're a little short on

548
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,060
time I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've tried to catch up some</font>

549
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:51,680
any questions I joel crouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

551
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,820
these things before parsing to figs and

552
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,160
then trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dump them into the</font>

00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,389
it gets

558
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:13,889
accessible area

559
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:17,970
yet the problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that</font>

560
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:20,520
everyone's network is different I think

561
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there are some things that there</font>

562
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:23,340
are few things in common I mean but the

563
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,690
database itself is something you almost

564
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,500
have to build yourself because it's

565
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,000
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

566
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,410
custom to your database<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is the</font>

567
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard part it is a really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part to</font>

568
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:32,340
build but just start with something that

569
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">starts something you understand like</font>

570
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,159
having a list of all your<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers and</font>

571
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,290
then move back addresses I mean if you

572
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,270
start there then you'd be surprised you

573
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:43,710
know how how beneficial that turns out

574
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:46,320
to be another question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah oh and</font>

575
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:48,030
all for impulse so my question that I

576
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,129
had some experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like auto IT</font>

577
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:52,320
and these kind of scripted you know in

578
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:54,360
fig<font color="#CCCCCC"> uhlet's I guess you called it was</font>

579
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,330
primarily and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you dressed</font>

580
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,469
it is that you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way of your</font>

581
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">configurations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or analyzation toward</font>

582
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,110
ignoring a certain subsection before was

583
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,790
given a thorough Smith any of a

584
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:09,090
classification scenario when you have

585
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:11,159
non-standard implementations so my

586
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is how have you automated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

587
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,630
other people going<font color="#CCCCCC"> there they throw it</font>

588
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,280
whatever crap they want to yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

589
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,480
do have an automation<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool that</font>

590
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,720
allows you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine what is</font>

591
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,090
non-standard without relying on all of

592
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:31,110
your administrators flagging it as a

593
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:32,610
non-standard it would be so anything

594
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:33,659
that's not in anything that doesn't

595
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,110
agree with what you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of the</font>

596
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:38,520
database is either well it's either it's

597
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,850
either buggin or generator which happens

598
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,400
but it's easy to fix or it is actually

599
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,719
non-standard or it is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

600
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,250
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been standard but you</font>

601
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,480
haven't you haven't made<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard</font>

602
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,560
you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctly document that or</font>

603
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,150
you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> crutchie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> told generated</font>

604
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,889
about that there's no way of

605
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,330
automatically distinguishing between the

606
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,550
last two cases there's no way of it

607
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,870
knowing whether or something was

608
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:59,669
standard but just didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

609
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:01,080
documentation people just kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of know</font>

610
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,640
about it that happens a lot they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

611
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,710
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when something something comes</font>

612
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,390
up they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it this way or whether</font>

613
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,950
something actually is wrong whether

614
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,390
people you know kept doing it that way

615
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,520
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should they should never have</font>

616
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:13,410
that's that's a decision that has to be

617
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,639
made by looking at what sorts of errors

618
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,930
you haven't seen you can find some

619
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,100
patterns in them and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

620
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,240
decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix all of</font>

621
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,659
them or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether you want to make a one</font>

622
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing standard</font>

623
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,230
another question over you your

624
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,270
particular issues looking at automation

625
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,070
first off what is your experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

626
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:31,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> netcom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so far actually actual</font>

627
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:33,179
implementation and then secondly with

628
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:34,800
regards to particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of things</font>

629
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,190
we're establishing database cannot be

630
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:51,870
difficult for Brigid motivating started

631
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:55,290
however monitoring station those

632
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:58,110
requests um so I think neck off is I

633
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:59,600
think the major goal of neck tops is

634
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:02,250
understanding is<font color="#E5E5E5"> dude is to get the</font>

635
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Juniper XML the benefits to everyone</font>

636
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,780
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah there's been pretty</font>

637
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,860
limited vendor support for that which

638
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,879
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been disappointed again since</font>

639
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,290
that's something that Jennifer did a

640
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,760
long time ago that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think was a really</font>

641
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">great idea and that I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should have</font>

642
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,780
been more widely adopted I would like to

643
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">see more vendor adoption of that cough</font>

644
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,990
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that certainly makes Marty not</font>

645
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:22,169
just these tools but all sorts of tools

646
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,730
a lot easier with that said even with

647
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:26,370
what you get out of rancid you can still

648
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,650
go really really far with it without

649
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">having without doing any sort of real</font>

650
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:31,620
time protocol<font color="#CCCCCC"> state scraping without</font>

651
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,570
doing anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that without with</font>

652
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,280
just comparing the configs you can solve

653
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,110
a lot of classes of problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

654
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,990
something that is it's kind of a well

655
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,459
hanging fruit there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so so overall</font>

656
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,890
your emphasis will be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the building</font>

657
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,870
consistent invigoration business service

658
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:46,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sorry I can't hear me be your</font>

659
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:48,619
prioritization

660
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:53,220
be with the automatic configuration

661
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:55,080
necessarily state yes I would say so so

662
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,759
I think that we we pretty much already

663
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,289
have good systems to detect when

664
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,489
interfaces are down it shouldn't be I

665
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:04,408
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think that's a solved</font>

666
00:21:59,489 --> 00:22:09,619
problem at most numbers I / Spears

667
00:22:04,409 --> 00:22:11,759
mornin uh putting her yes it seems me

668
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,230
differently NOC staffing people have to

669
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,640
see those

670
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,450
disregard down

671
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,600
pollination

672
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:22,710
checking up on the status of the network

673
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,389
now one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we started to do</font>

674
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:25,680
because they're tuning into the jar<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

675
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,970
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow our procedures</font>

676
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,190
that we set in place you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> throttle</font>

677
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">generating things need to change we</font>

678
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,690
started coming to commit scripts and I'm

679
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:35,490
scripts to really just check that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

680
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,010
person that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually safe to take off is</font>

681
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:41,340
doing it the right way we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going you</font>

682
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,780
got to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting um so in general</font>

683
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a there's a hesitation to</font>

684
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,980
actually prevent people from doing

685
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,240
things warning them about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> often if</font>

686
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,100
you tell people that you know something

687
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,390
seems unsafe<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you know they should</font>

688
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,770
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the ability to override that</font>

689
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:55,080
because often they they have a good

690
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:57,360
reason or it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually isn't done say</font>

691
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,189
they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> just along in your check so I</font>

692
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,629
think that rather than preventing

693
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,890
engineers and doing their job it's

694
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,480
better to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just getting tools that will</font>

695
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,710
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know help them do their that that's</font>

696
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,020
part of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really even</font>

697
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:08,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">a.m. you know those those the whole</font>

698
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,320
point is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not you know that</font>

699
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:12,180
engineers<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lazy or careless because</font>

700
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,320
this is something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is inevitable is</font>

701
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:15,420
something that humans are just not good

702
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,740
at and if you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> people tools that are</font>

703
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:18,060
better than what they have now do you

704
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,680
give people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools that are easier to use</font>

705
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,820
than cut and pasting or pulling stuff

706
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,620
out of documentation filling in blanks

707
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,909
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that you won't have any</font>

708
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:25,909
resistance in getting people to use it

709
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:35,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">hey one more hi Richard Steinberg on a</font>

710
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,050
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I just wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on the</font>

711
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,490
use of commit scripts because that's

712
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:41,310
what we do so basically the approach

713
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we took was to say that there's</font>

714
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain things that you're not going to</font>

715
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,490
be able to store in the database either

716
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,280
because it's too complex or it's too

717
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,080
hard to design

718
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,300
database to cover every possible one off

719
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,949
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover so you know</font>

720
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:56,200
there's certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you can you</font>

721
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,880
can push out to to database generated

722
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,680
and script push configs like for example

723
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,560
prefix list generation is a perfect

724
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:05,590
example of that but what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> found was</font>

725
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,030
really heavily<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on Miss</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> groups while</font>

726
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,770
still giving people the ability to

727
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,720
override stuff but but really

728
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:13,660
simplifying a lot of the configuration

729
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,070
itself and making it so that automated

730
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,100
systems do a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work on the</font>

731
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">backend that the operator doesn't see or</font>

732
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,879
doesn't have to be concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> with and</font>

733
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">adds additional safety checks is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> huge</font>

734
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,600
benefit you get your config you know

735
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,620
when you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10,000 like a big and</font>

736
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,629
get it down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to four</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred lines</font>

737
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,429
because you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> beautiful commit</font>

738
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,230
scripts<font color="#E5E5E5"> it makes it much easier to</font>

739
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,910
manage yeah that's certainly another

740
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:37,860
approach that essentially you put the

741
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:40,860
generation in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router itself yeah</font>

742
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,860
thanks

743
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:50,779
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael</font>
