00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,890
on their own and started to put together

spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time talking to</font>

we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> on IP we had the opportunity to</font>

97
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,669
use IP four key distribution or that so

101
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,669
that's a shame<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had to build</font>

102
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:42,650
quite a large back-end system to support

103
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:47,520
all this as well and so we got this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

104
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:50,330
looks very much like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would your TV</font>

00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:02,250
on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC what we found was that student</font>

108
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,760
rooms are getting smaller and students

109
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,760
are getting bigger

110
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:12,219
they didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring both PC and a</font>

00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:15,849
TV<font color="#E5E5E5"> on campus and certainly in the early</font>

112
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,409
days talking to universities they almost

113
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,139
wanted to discourage the students<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

114
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:23,830
bringing TVs because there to provide

115
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,870
more power sockets in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rooms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

116
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,210
electrical safety testing to be done and

117
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:32,979
all the rest so universities encouraged

118
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:37,150
us to go down the PC room so we

119
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:40,659
developed a solution look what we call a

120
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:48,400
virtual set top box which we pretty much

121
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:50,620
emulate a<font color="#E5E5E5"> set-top box on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC so in fact</font>

122
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,270
it's been developed so that too

123
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,870
middleware systems that in the server

124
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:57,039
side of IPTV they can pretty much not

125
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:59,169
tell the difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> whether</font>

126

00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,919
hand the traffic off to regional network

147
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:02,590
operators which there's 19 around the UK

cast to all the universities of course

155
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,450
we had a few challenges along the way

156
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,960
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> universities they're very familiar</font>

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:37,299
just worked you go to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of listen to</font>

159
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:39,220
a lot of talks about IPTV read a lot of

162
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,030
kin and say that it's exceptionally hard

00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,520

and all their special tweaks to make

166
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,450
IPTV just work and what we found was<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

167
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:58,350
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave any of that as long as</font>

168
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,700
multicast gets from a to b then it works

169
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:04,900
of course we did have quite a few

them<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the in most cases it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was easy</font>

176
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:27,030
you bring up your<font color="#CCCCCC"> msdp so you bring up</font>

177
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,510
your peer adjacencies and it works

178
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:33,850
except they all put finals in the way

179
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:37,960
what we found was lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> reuter vendors</font>

180
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:41,230
router vendors sorry have dr. I've got

181
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:44,440
multicast sorted now and it's just a

182
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:49,450
switch to turn it on file or vendors not

183
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,640
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same they I think we had one</font>

184

particular checkpoint not entirely sure

185
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:57,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've actually fixed it yet where</font>

186
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,670
if it worked if it was running in layer

187
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,530

190
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,980
mode and him what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so what we</font>

191
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,689
found was a lot universities were having

192
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,030
to build little bypasses around their

193
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,900
file

194
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:21,230
was to allow multi casting which which

195
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:24,770
worse GRE tunnel saw or just a cable

196
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:30,200
around the outside the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we</font>

197
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:31,490
found was that universities in response

198
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,680
to the problem streaming traffic

199
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,150
peer-to-peer traffic are putting a lot

<font color="#CCCCCC">of package shaping and bandwidth</font>

201

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:41,270

bandwidth that their students can get to

204
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:48,860
from their dorm rooms except we want to

deliver to<font color="#CCCCCC"> making extremes to them so we</font>

206
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,420
often found that the package shapers

207
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,820
would write limit this nice to me

208

<font color="#E5E5E5">extremely because that must be bad down</font>

210

211
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:10,430
that router vendors will tell you that

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,040
they used the easy fix to cause which is

work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the University</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't control the network from eight</font>

235

service so when it breaks they phone us

236
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,670
up and say hey you know it's broken so

237
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:36,050
we have a look and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

238
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,140
university is not actually receiving any

239
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,719

240
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,010
regional network operator regional

241
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,080

Janet and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> University we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had no</font>

244
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,810
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us so when the</font>

245
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">university phoned them up and said hey</font>

246
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:56,540
it's broken they said no it must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

247
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:59,420
fault must be Janet's fault so we go off

248
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,620
and we talked to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Janet and say hey those</font>

249
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:02,329
guys over there say that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

250
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,450
giving them any mods gust and Janice say

251
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,770
yes we are look it's going there so we

252
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,640
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the University who'd go back</font>

253
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:13,850
to the regional network operator and the

254
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:15,290
problem typically magically goes away no

255
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,880
one admits that they broke anything no

256
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:18,880
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> admits they ever fixed anything but</font>

257
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,720
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we learned very</font>

258
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:29,399
quickly was<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we needed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot</font>

259
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,399
better visibility into what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on</font>

260
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,600
unicast you kind of push it out a new

261
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:37,779
hope it gets there so what we had to do

262
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,920
was deploy a number of remote multicast

263
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:44,170
monitoring notes into the universities

264
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,790
which were able to detect and analyze

265
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,199
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> incoming the encoding multicast</font>

266
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:51,389

regional<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network we could seem to see</font>

270
00:13:56,529 --> 00:14:00,129
patterns whereby if all the monitoring

271
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,930
nodes on one regional network went down

272
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:03,639
but all the other regional network

273
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,800
monitoring notes data then there's a

274
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,509
great good possibility that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">regional network operator that was at</font>

276

step from web TV the streaming which is

294
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:21,920
typically low bitrate to get it down

299
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,649
maybe it's just because we've got

300

302
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:46,380
of course as I say multicast is

303
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">unidirectional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we throw it out there</font>

328
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,210
later and everyone switched off so they

329
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:06,448
can tailor their they're broadcasting

330
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:08,339
accordingly but equally the advertisers

331
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:11,880
like this as well because they know to

332
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:14,250
the to pretty much to the user into the

key revenue opportunities for us in IPTV

00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:43,379
which is advertising what we've found is

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:47,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertisers are very keen that they</font>

can now have an addressable audience we

habits and things like that which allows

348
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,750
us to do targeted advertising we're

349
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:03,820
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trial on that at the moment in</font>

we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking the channel for string and</font>

putting through an ad splicer and

00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:48,129
producing different versions of it which

364
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:50,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of negates the the benefits of</font>

365
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,150
doing multicast because suddenly you
