00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,969
to have a monitoring solution that can

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,240
deliver service quality and security in

21
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:10,290

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,789
one method of doing that and then look

at a few use cases and how to achieve

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:20,670
those so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was intending on covering the</font>

33
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:48,030
basically bring in the challenge of a

34
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,970
lot of services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that require different</font>

35
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,570
kind of guarantees and the services

36
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,479
could be boys video data or led to

37
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,460
earlier three VPNs now each and we can

38
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with targeted solutions for each</font>

39
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">and every one of them but the whole</font>

40
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,570
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes so unwieldy that it's not</font>

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,479
a practical approach so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

42
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution that that's a single</font>

43
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">solution and does not destabilize the</font>

44
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,208
net

45
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:18,620
in any way so it's basically transparent

46
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:22,520
to the service that's being delivered as

47
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:26,300
well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> its standards-based and doesn't</font>

48
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,390
get into any vendor lock-in issues so

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,099
the solution is basically using

50
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,679
technologies like<font color="#E5E5E5"> s flow and net flow</font>

51
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,290
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm assuming most of you are</font>

52
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">familiar with s flow but basically to</font>

53
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,380
give<font color="#E5E5E5"> a brief or array of that is that s</font>

54
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:46,440
flow is a technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a monitoring</font>

55
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,420
technology where packets with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

56
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,150
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually sampled and the</font>

57
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">sample traffic is sent back to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ESPO</font>

58
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,080
collector at a different location where

59
00:02:53,069 --> 00:03:00,000
it's used for offline analysis so most

60
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,760
of the sampling actually does happen in

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,170
the hardware which means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't</font>

62
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,290
affect the management processor and

63
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,030
doesn't impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network as violence</font>

64
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,220
delivering the services is concerned and

65
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:15,569
all the analysis is actually done

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:20,549
offline which means that the router by

67
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:22,440
such is not affected so the proactive

68
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,959
monitoring solution using s flow it

69
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,940
enables are predicting detecting and any

70
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,209
isolating any<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential problems that</font>

71
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:33,150
that could be they in the network so

72
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,790
let's start with the video networks so

73
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:38,579
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a typical video network where</font>

74
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,900
you have the video<font color="#E5E5E5"> head in on one side</font>

75
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:44,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you have a network in which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your the</font>

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,470
edge routers the services<font color="#E5E5E5"> are being</font>

77
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:49,410
delivered to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers through the</font>

78
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,690
edge routers now in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

79
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:56,430
solution you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can able the S flow at</font>

80
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:59,579
various points in the network and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> S</font>

81
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:03,000
flow data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent back to the collectors</font>

82
00:03:59,579 --> 00:04:07,859
which is located at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nog over here</font>

83
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,950
and that's gonna that's could either be

84
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:15,209
going in band or or outer band now

85
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,159
depending on the network now the

86
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,200
doubters need to be as for enabled if

87
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,060
some of the routers are not as for

88
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,029
enabled we can take a passive optical

89
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">tab</font>

90
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:29,049
and send<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a optical that send it to</font>

91
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:31,330
a s1 able to outer so in this particular

92
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,540
solution what we can do is we can take

93
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,130
the stream whenever we see a a certain

94
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,490
trigger now the trigger could be either

95
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:42,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you missed a few s4 samples or we</font>

96
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:45,340
have the operator actually wants to look

97
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,659
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stream or a customer's call in</font>

98
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,090
and said okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am not receiving my</font>

99
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,419
video properly could you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you check</font>

100
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">that and in but these triggers what the</font>

101
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,580
operator could do is put an ACL based

102
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,490
mirror on the point where the problem is

103
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:05,109
observed and take that traffic and send

104
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:07,150
it back using a vll to to the knock and

105
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,890
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the original stream</font>

106
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,989
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stream that is going to the</font>

107
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:16,000
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and side by side you can</font>

108
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:19,510
compare that so this provides a

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">closed-loop network visibility the the</font>

110
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:25,090
sampling rate on this could be as

111
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,979
aggressive as one and 512 packets are

112
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,369
usually it's a kept a bit higher

113
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:36,039
depending on the rate of the basically

114
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:38,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the speed of the interface so let's go</font>

115
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">on to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide this one basically</font>

116
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:44,469
shows a flowchart of what happens you

117
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,200
program s flow at various end points on

118
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,470
the routers and the samples<font color="#E5E5E5"> are sent to</font>

119
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> esco collector in the NOC one of the</font>

120
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,390
three triggers that we described the

121
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:59,169
moment that's done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> those triggers</font>

122
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,300
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> program an ACL that we mirrored the</font>

123
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:03,930
traffic back and then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> compare</font>

124
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,919
that to original stream and take a

125
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,900
recovery action so after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I said</font>

126
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's see what's the overhead</font>

127
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,669
that's coming on the network so i added

128
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">i took the most aggressive sampling rate</font>

129
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:22,120
one in 512<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4s flow</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then took a 10</font>

130
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,880
gig interface added all the overheads

131
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,910
that's there in the SQL packets and put

132
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,760
them together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saw that the overhead</font>

133
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:33,470
on that interface was about Oh point

134
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,200
zero two percent of the interface rate

135
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:41,300
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low overhead so that</font>

136
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:43,520
that's good so to sum it up for<font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

137
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,740
network so basically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are this</font>

138
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,620
provides us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a real-time network</font>

139
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,360
visibility solution without any

140
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,070
performance degradation because all this

141
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,000
for sampling<font color="#E5E5E5"> is happening in the</font>

142
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:58,090
hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the SLO collector is also</font>

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,040
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the analysis is being done offline</font>

144
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,020
this one easily integrates into existing

145
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,710

00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:10,900
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an able s flow on the on the various</font>

154
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:32,679
reliable is provide in band and out of

<font color="#E5E5E5">going back of after mirroring is going</font>

159
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,669
over mpls vll which is using the

160
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:53,510
underlying mpls infrastructure that that

161
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:55,880
provides the resiliency of mpls and you

162
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,370
can have multiple locations you can put

163
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,800
the mirror traffic as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as s flow at</font>

165
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:11,080

166
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:14,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">next this thing using mpls VPN</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s so in a</font>

167
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,890
mpls VPN network the so more and more

168
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,260
business services are moving towards

169
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,570
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> POS based VPNs it could be layer 2</font>

170
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,700
or layer 3 VPNs but the challenge out

171
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,650
here is that the customer traffic is all

172
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:29,630
aggregate together into a single tunnel

173
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:31,310
and any aggregated statistics that can

174
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:35,479
be taken out from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tunnel are not</font>

175
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:39,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">very useful so the requirement out here</font>

176
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:41,780
is to find out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to monitor</font>

177
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:45,199
traffic performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> in availability but</font>

178
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:46,189
get information on a per VPN endpoint

179
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,350
basis

180
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:52,880
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on so you want information on</font>

181
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,550
a per customer bases on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top talkers</font>

182
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,340
the traffic trends and any threat

183
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:03,349
detection but not aggregate but on a per

184
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:05,390
VPN instance basis so this needs very

185
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:07,850
similar requirements as the previous

186
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,850
network got you need to enable<font color="#CCCCCC"> s flow</font>

187
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:13,130
add the provider edge networks prior to

188
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:15,860
edge and then take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the SPO</font>

189
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:19,100
collector<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be at the NOC and</font>

190
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:22,460
then you can use a standalone<font color="#CCCCCC"> s4</font>

191
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,780
collection that supports mpls traffic

192
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:30,890
analysis and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them available</font>

193
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:33,680
from various vendors the SLO version 5

194
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,890
includes<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpo space information and in</font>

195
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,030
the impedance based information it has

196
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,189
same place<font color="#CCCCCC"> vc information which is</font>

197
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:43,579
basically the VPN<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance information</font>

198
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:46,520
so it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vc name vc ID and the</font>

199
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,290
costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> are valium as far as sternal</font>

200
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,020
information is concerned it can have

201
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:55,610
tunnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> name tunnel index and tower costs</font>

202
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:57,319
as well so any abnormal traffic patterns

203
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,240
that can be detected over here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

204
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,030
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and take actions</font>

205
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,420
accordingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I have a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> examples in</font>

206
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,760
the subsequent slides which look at

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:10,099
traffic trends for<font color="#CCCCCC"> vc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ID top talkers in</font>

208

traffic totals and based<font color="#CCCCCC"> upon various</font>

209
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:18,380
parameters that are there so here on the

210
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:20,750
left side<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have basically two VPNs or</font>

211
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,540
two VPS instances sir so two different

212
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:26,720
customers we place for 21 and for 22 and

213
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:29,900
the graph actually shows what the

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,070
traffic rates are bits per second for

215
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:36,410
that for the various customers on the

00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:38,240
right side<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can look at the chart how</font>

217
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,969
this chart is more useful when you have

218
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,530
a good big number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of customers let's say</font>

219
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,230
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 customers and you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

220
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,699
at all there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a certain trend among</font>

221
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,380
most of the customers but you see

222
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,080
certain outliers like someone's are

223
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,990
taking way more bandwidth then you can

224
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:56,030
either you can take action<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

225
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:56,720
migrating them asking them to migrate to

226
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,509
a higher

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:06,050
bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> the higher price service or</font>

228
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:08,180
rate limiting them is some tables that

229
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,519
has more information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the packets</font>

230
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,810
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower table if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it</font>

231
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:17,149
has information on the EP a-- the<font color="#CCCCCC"> VPS</font>

232
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,008
instance over here as well as the

233
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:22,310
traffic type so that's the ether type in

234
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">this particular case the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mac source and</font>

235
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,869
the mac destination and what's the total

236
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:29,420
bandwidth at this particular customer

237
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,310
has used and based upon<font color="#E5E5E5"> this source and</font>

238
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:37,099
destination as well so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get that</font>

239
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:40,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">level of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> detail on that information so</font>

240
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,759
since this is a sampling based approach

241
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:46,489
there is there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an error range because</font>

242
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:50,269
the total traffic is based upon sampling

243
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:54,860
and in this particular example we can

244
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:56,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">see that we can reduce</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the errors but to</font>

245
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,319
reduce the error we have to do one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

246
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:02,300
the two things or both one way is to

247
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,860
increase the sampling rate but that

248
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,319
increases the overhead on the network

249
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,980
because you're sending packets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

250
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:11,779
collector more often or take the samples

251
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,720
or take the increase the<font color="#E5E5E5"> period over</font>

252
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:16,850
which the samples are<font color="#E5E5E5"> collected which</font>

253
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,509
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually any an additional</font>

254
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,089
overhead so that way you can reduce the

255
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:24,800
error in that if you need more details

256
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:30,139
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> linked over here that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has more</font>

257
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:33,740
details<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how these are calculated so</font>

258
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:36,800
benefits of using<font color="#CCCCCC"> s flow in mpls network</font>

259
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:38,540
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it it's very low overhead all</font>

260
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,959
the collection is done in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:44,660
the analysis is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done offline and it</font>

262
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:48,258
provides you real-time monitoring so you

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:51,019
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor the SI lays off of your high</font>

264
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:53,410
level customers as well as identify top

265
00:12:51,019 --> 00:12:56,149

266
00:12:53,410 --> 00:13:00,709
all the time providing full visibility

of the network as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well as reporting as</font>

well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's for the MPLS networks</font>

269
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,160
so regarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> other services which</font>

include so if you are triple play<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

left out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the voice and data services so</font>

272
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:24,579
the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one way to look at that would</font>

273
00:13:20,829 --> 00:13:27,069
be a based upon the service class so lot

274
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:29,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">of carriers when they sending out when</font>

they using voice traffic as well as

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,760
mission-critical data as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am</font>

best effort data they all sent over

278
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,630
different priorities so you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4</font>

279
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:43,389
toss field or ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> party fields to</font>

280

identify those frames and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

281
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:51,399
patterns can be studied accordingly for

282
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,939
our voice traffic it's a bit more more

283
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,670
complicated the one way to do at a very

284
00:13:54,940 --> 00:14:00,100
high level you can get some macroscopic

285
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:02,589
information by looking at by analyzing

286
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rtcp traffic and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:14,250
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high level other ways of</font>

290
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,540
doing is you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter the RTP traffic</font>

291
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:19,120
based upon codec and the source

292
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,579
destination IP and you can get

293
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,240
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> like overall packet loss</font>

294
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:30,729
jitter information and use that for for

295
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:35,019
voice quality for<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-speed internet</font>

296
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:38,949
access the multiple uses of actually

297
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:41,829
provide good information one first one

298
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:43,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">is for training where you want to see</font>

299
00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:45,000
where the traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going and you can</font>

300
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,380
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> project it in future and see</font>

301
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,110
what are the expectations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

302
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:53,350
and how fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's growing and what you</font>

303
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:55,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to upgrade to at a future date also</font>

304
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,529
it can identify popular sources<font color="#E5E5E5"> or beat</font>

305
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:03,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google Yahoo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a YouTube or xbox life all</font>

306
00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:06,250
that information helps in optimizing the

307
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:08,019
network now you can based upon this

308
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:10,449
information you can reduce the

309
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:14,860
congestion in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network latency or</font>

310
00:15:10,449 --> 00:15:17,079
optimize the reducer target costs same

311
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,950
thing you can also look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS path</font>

312
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:20,319
information

313
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:24,820
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what for them for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic and</font>

314
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">then reduced transit caused by getting a</font>

315
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:32,340
direct bearing relationship in case of

316
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:35,110
traffic's a lot so a ver various traffic

317
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:38,500
analysis tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> are available for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

318
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,500
and I mean various vendors to that there

319
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,840
are freeware tools as well and all this

320
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,420
analysis done offline of course and

321
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:55,360
without affecting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> performance of the</font>

322
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:57,550
network I said so how this next item is

323
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:02,470
how we can use this approach for

324
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:04,660
enhancing security in a network so one

325
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,130
approach is a CL based inbound<font color="#E5E5E5"> s flow</font>

326
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,560
what this does is you can actually

327
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:10,240
configure an ACL if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> expecting a</font>

328
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,329
certain kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of traffic you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

329
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,280
configure<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ACL and only those packets</font>

330
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,610
at master is here will be sent to the

331
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,890
expo collector what this is useful for

332
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,490
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like any reconnaissance attacks</font>

333
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:26,880
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> or dos attacks on any network misuse</font>

334
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:30,160
the example out here is showing a

335
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,910
particular voiced<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically capturing</font>

336
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,360
all the TCP syn packets and that can be

337
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:40,120
monitored offline the advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

338
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,240
versus mirroring is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it's lower</font>

339
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:46,510
overhead because it's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get only</font>

340
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,030
the package that match as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

341
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">only taking the header off the packets</font>

342
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:55,600
the current 28 x star them turning the

343
00:16:51,160 --> 00:17:01,120
whole packet so that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it much more</font>

344
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:05,860
usable so in the two examples the left

345
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:08,109
side is for threat detection when it's a

346
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:11,469
known threat and the right side<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a new</font>

347
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:13,359
thread so looking at known threats we

348
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,640
know the signature let's say it's a worm

349
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,379
we know the signature of the worm and we

350
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,970
can look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that particular signature</font>

351
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:24,550
and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> perform offline analysis by</font>

352
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,829
comparing that to the known signature so

353
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:29,620
the moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is detected you can it</font>

354
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,570
can trigger an alarm on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other hand</font>

355
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:33,549
when it's a new threat we

356
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:35,678
not aware of any any signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> because a</font>

357
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:38,019
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat at that time we're looking at</font>

358
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,960
profiling we should start profiling the

359
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:42,789
behavior of course so if if certain

360
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">horse is actually scanning all the ports</font>

361
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:48,879
in that particular case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there are</font>

362
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:53,350
policy violations we can detect that and

363
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,269
then take take recovery action so in

364
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:58,469
both cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recovery action could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

365
00:17:55,269 --> 00:18:01,809
either applying a rate-limiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ACL are</font>

366
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:05,490
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop policies are also the other</font>

367
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:05,490
ways to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp black holing</font>

368
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,540
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a traffic magnet example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

369
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:20,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over one slide basically the</font>

370
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:22,250
thing out<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is some of the users the</font>

371
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:25,070
problem statement is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

372
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:27,950
users in the network are actually using

373
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:30,740
most of the bandwidth and a bandwidth

374
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network capacity is limited which</font>

375
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:35,240
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the network</font>

376
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,220
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> up we want to optimize the</font>

377
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,460
traffic management in the net loss so to

378
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,360
do that the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's coming from</font>

379
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:46,430
the host is reusing traffic management

380
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:51,439
basically measurements using s flow or

381
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:53,560
net flow and then we can use controls to

382
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,950
actually mark that traffic either down

383
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:00,679
by priority or we can rate limited or

384
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,780
block that traffic so<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever the</font>

385
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,700
traffic's marked with a lower priority

386
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,240
the router it will go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the router and</font>

387
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,950
the router will give<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better preference</font>

388
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,910
to the traffic that's conforming versus

389
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:15,530
that's not conforming so you want to

390
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:21,220
spend too much time on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one because</font>

391
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of time constraints but so basically</font>

392
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:28,280
summarizing that we can achieve good

393
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,610
service assurance using proactive

394
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,860
monitoring now what this provides us is

395
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,600
that it's a real time s flow based

396
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:39,169
monitoring solution with very low

397
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,689
overhead on the network and hardware and

398
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:46,220
all the analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done offline so you</font>

399
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:47,780
can do much more often<font color="#E5E5E5"> alisis and at the</font>

400
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:51,980
emptiness level you can get good

401
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:54,410
information about MPs VPNs and it

402
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:56,900
provides a good tool for effective

403
00:19:54,410 --> 00:20:01,610
anomaly detection and recovery

404
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:05,350
mechanisms so this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have any</font>

00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:05,350
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll answer those</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay if I Cameron no questions thank you</font>

407
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:16,810
very much Rahul and Betty are you ready
