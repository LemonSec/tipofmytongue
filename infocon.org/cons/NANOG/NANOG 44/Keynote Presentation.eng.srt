45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit like the talking dinosaur who</font>

let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> start out just by explaining</font>

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:21,680
something my title<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Google is chief</font>

77
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,958
internet evangelist and all I didn't ask

78
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,450
for the title it somebody suggested

79
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,070
after I had proposed Archduke<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

80
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:30,470
said well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't quite fit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in there</font>

81
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:32,120
nomenclature if any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

confronted with the opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

83
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,100
become an internet evangelist I can tell

84
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:39,890
you that the formal robes that you see

85
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:41,989
there are literally the academic robes

86
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,970
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Balearic</font>

formal legitimate academic outfit you

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,410
don't get to wear things like that very

90
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:55,070
often so I wore that on my first day of

91
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,230
work at Google just for fun I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,120
an incredibly hard job<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I probably</font>

98
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,250
have less appreciation for what your

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,049
problems and broken code and screwed up

<font color="#CCCCCC">that no doubt pepper your day and your</font>

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,979
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really very encouraging is that while</font>

and you contribute very greatly to that

121
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,950
we're entering a period where ipv6

122
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,229
deployment in my opinion is necessary

123
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,700
some people are still debating<font color="#E5E5E5"> that some</font>

124
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,789
people might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternatives to</font>

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:19,889
propose but in any event assuming that

<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue forward on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that path you</font>

127
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:25,500
will have a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> critical role to play</font>

128
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:29,880
in making ipv6 work together with and in

129
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">parallel with ipv4 for one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing making</font>

130
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">two systems run concurrently is a lot</font>

131
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,990
harder than having only one to run but

132
00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:38,550
we're just ipv6 life would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> somewhat</font>

133
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,520
easier but it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be that</font>

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,620
formats is probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> less mature than</font>

136
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:48,030
that which we're using for ipv4 you're

137
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,419
going to have to live through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

138
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:55,138
in some ways contribute to its mature

139
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,539
maturing and finally the thing that I'm

140

<font color="#E5E5E5">very concerned about is that the history</font>

connectivity when the core networks were

the NSFNET backbone and ARPANET for

147
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:15,000
system started with a connected core and

148
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,400
it stayed that way for the most part

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,040
except when things bro

150
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,560
ipv6 is not the same because it's

151
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:23,720
popping up in various places and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

152
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,130
because you implement ipv6 doesn't mean

153
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,500
that you're connected with some other

154

piece of the network that's capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

155
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,970
running ipv6 so we aren't starting with

156
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,800
a connected core and I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

157
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,500
fix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are several ways that</font>

158
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,020
one might do that to the extent that you

159
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,669
have anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say about policy in</font>

160
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,830
your various organizations you might

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:44,630
argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you already have an ipv4</font>

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,340
appearing agreement with someone maybe

163
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,740
you should agree to appear with v6 as

164
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,869
well if we were to succeed in that

165
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,840
measure then maybe we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have as</font>

connected a v6 network as we have a v4

167
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,310
one I had also suggested to some of the

168
00:06:56,449 --> 00:07:01,639
network operators that they consider a

169
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:04,340
liberal ipv6 peering policy for a period

170
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,120
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to assure connectivity even</font>

171
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,679
though one might reserve the right to

172
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,460
disconnect or change the charging

173
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,130
structure or something later on as the

174
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:21,049
ipv6 traffic becomes a significant part

175
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:23,409
of the flow so finally I wanted to tell

176
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:26,780
you a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> story about what it's like</font>

like a drunken Norwegian so the day came

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:34,610
when I had to demonstrate the system

304
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,489
so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> ingress peeked through the</font>

312
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,790
that one out so the packet radio system

313
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:10,310
was actually very successful it was

314
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:13,540
demonstrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> and tested in field</font>

315

316
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,349
stimulated an interest in continuing

317
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:21,170
this effort to make packet switching

318
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:24,260

320
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,540
pursued a packet satellite demonstration

where we use dental sat for a with

actually called<font color="#CCCCCC"> C pota which contention</font>

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:51,020
which meant that you demanded access you

00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,329
announced your requirements in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aloha</font>

331
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:56,839
the announcements were at all the ground

stations everybody calculated the same

schedule for people to transmit without

334
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,050
interfering with each other so that

335
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,730
system was implemented and it also

336
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,650
worked very well but now the question

337
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">was how do we get all these different</font>

338
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:10,130
networks to work together<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

339
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,470
had different<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet sizes and error</font>

340
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:13,910
rates and delays and speeds and

341
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,240
everything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the problem</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob Kahn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I started to work on</font>

343
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,670
35 years ago in the spring of 1973 we

344
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,360
figured out roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do it</font>

345
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:27,910
published a paper in 1974 developed

346
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,420
achievement at stanford university

347
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:34,490
developed the basic design<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp with</font>

348
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,209
the first spec coming out in december 74

349
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,130
but november of 1977 we had enough of

350
00:14:38,209 --> 00:14:43,040
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems in operation to actually</font>

351
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,860
link them all together and so we built

352
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,699
and tested a the three network

routers so we call them gateways were

362
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:12,110
modified in order to force the traffic

363
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,579
to go from the packet radio network into

364
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,620
the ARPANET all the way across the

365

ARPANET through an internal satellite

366
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:23,029
hop then down to 0 and landed in Norway

367
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:24,890
and then it went down to London

University College London on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> landline</font>

369
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:28,970
then it came out of UCL out of the

ARPANET in effect through another

<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty excited about that it was an</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the architecture would actually</font>

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,770
thought was an important milestone well

or black market in ipv4 address space

fragmentation of the address mean space

00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:21,180
the time I sort of understood that this

575
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,449
geolocation data was valuable but I

576
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,419
didn't viscerally appreciate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

577
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:30,110
my family went<font color="#CCCCCC"> on vacation last year in</font>

578
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:32,299
May we went to Lake Powell which is near

579
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,949
Page Arizona and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided to rent a</font>

580
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,899
house boat go out on the lake for a few

581
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,269
days and as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were driving into Page</font>

582
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:40,010
Arizona it occurred to us that we would

583
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:41,659
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out what food to bring on</font>

584
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:43,970
the boat because once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on right</font>

585
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:46,039
there no grocery stores so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

586
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,840
about what kind of food<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should buy</font>

587
00:23:46,039 --> 00:23:51,260
and somebody says why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we make</font>

588
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,658
paella and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I remember thinking oh that's</font>

589
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,429
a wonderful idea but you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> safran to</font>

590
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,340
make a good paella where the heck am I

591
00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:00,380
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> safran in Page Arizona</font>

592
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:02,408
well as luck would have it I had a good

593
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,970
GPRS signal so I pulled out the

594
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:07,850
blackberry went to the Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> homepage</font>

595
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> safran Page Arizona grocery</font>

596
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:12,199
store<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a bunch of several phone</font>

597
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:14,330
numbers popped up in little maps and

598
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,429
addresses showing grocery store choices

599
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:19,639
in the area so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I clicked on the</font>

600
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:21,860
telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> number and the phone dial</font>

601
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">their ring somebody picked up the phone</font>

602
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,059
and I said hello could I speak to the

603
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,679
spice<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department please well this is</font>

604
00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:29,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably some small little store and</font>

605
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the owner and he this is</font>

606
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:35,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">the spice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> department I said you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

607
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:36,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">section safran he says I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know but</font>

608
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:39,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll go look so he comes back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and says</font>

609
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,199
yep I've got some so we followed the map

610
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:43,549
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blackberry to the store and I ran</font>

611
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,860
in and bought twelve dollars and

612
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:47,779
ninety-nine cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> safran that's</font>

613
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,850
point 0 6 ounces in case you wondered

614
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:52,130
and we went off and made a really nice

615
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:54,080
paella on the houseboat so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that I</font>

616
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:55,700
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking my gosh you know I</font>

617
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">just got information that I needed</font>

618
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,389
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I needed it and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the</font>

619
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,159
right kind of information I didn't get

620
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:03,918
information that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get safran in</font>

621
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,210
new york city 1,500 miles away<font color="#E5E5E5"> I needed</font>

622
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,409
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know where could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i get it in Page</font>

623
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:11,480
Arizona so I've come away with much more

624
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:13,429
you know visceral appreciation for why

625
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:16,549
geolocation information can be so

626
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,710
valuable well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of us are</font>

627
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:20,450
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to experience not just an internet</font>

628
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:22,039
for everyone but an internet for

629
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:23,809
everything and I certainly been

630
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:25,658
surprised to see the kinds of devices

631
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:28,309
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have shown up on the internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

632
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:30,200
ensuing 30 years since its original

633
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:31,760
invention refrigerators and picture

634
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,279
frames and things that look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> phones</font>

635
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,039
but they're really voice over IP devices

636
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:38,289
but I like this

637
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,749
internet-enabled surfboard that some guy

638
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:42,129
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Diego put together you know</font>

639
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:45,009
that's what that's what you do in San

640
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:46,478
Diego I guess I all I can imagine is he

641
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:47,950
was sitting on water waiting for the

642
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:49,539
next way of thinking you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I had a</font>

643
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">laptop in my surfboard I could be</font>

644
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:55,960
surfing the internet while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm waiting</font>

645
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:58,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the next way so he built a laptop</font>

646
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,129
into his surfboard and they put a Wi-Fi

647
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:01,659
server the rescue Shack back on the

648
00:26:00,129 --> 00:26:04,269
beach and now he sells this is a product

649
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:07,239
so in case you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in surfing</font>

650
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:09,210
the net while you're surfing you have an

651
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:11,679
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that so I'm actually</font>

652
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,419
estimating that there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font>

653
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,669
things on the net than there are people

654
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:17,349
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of appliances</font>

655
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:20,379
and devices that you carry around all

656
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:22,539
the time you could kind of imagine that

657
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:24,969
there could be anywhere from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 to 100</font>

658
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:27,330
things on the net that are serving<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

659
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:30,789
while you're off doing other things

660
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:33,070
things like web TVs or PDAs or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mobile's</font>

661
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:35,619
or video games<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all part of the</font>

662
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:37,658
internet environment these days there's

663
00:26:35,619 --> 00:26:39,809
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> an internet-enabled washing machine</font>

664
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:41,979
which turned out to be quite popular in

665
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:44,229
universities basically you put your

666
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:45,999
laundry in the washing machine key and

667
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:48,220
some information<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it will send you an</font>

668
00:26:45,999 --> 00:26:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">SMS when the laundry is done so you can</font>

669
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">go have a beer while you're waiting for</font>

670
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:55,509
your laundry to finish up then you go

671
00:26:51,549 --> 00:26:57,009
move it to the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dryer I've often</font>

672
00:26:55,509 --> 00:26:59,799
wondered what one would do with an

673
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:01,570
internet-enabled refrigerator it has a

674
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,789
nice liquid crystal display

675
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:06,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">touch-sensitive on the on the front of</font>

676
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:09,070
the door which I guess augments the

677
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:11,439
typical american household communication

678
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,029
which is with paper and magnets most of

679
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,379
us have paper covering the front of the

680
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:17,649
refrigerator with little notes to each

681
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:20,259
other now you can have web you know web

682
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:23,258
pages and<font color="#E5E5E5"> blogs and email and other</font>

683
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:24,970
kinds of family interaction but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

684
00:27:23,259 --> 00:27:26,769
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

685
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:29,349
things you put into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the refrigerator had</font>

686
00:27:26,769 --> 00:27:31,269
RFID chips in them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if the</font>

687
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:33,009
refrigerator had a way of detecting what

688
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:34,989
it has inside then while you're off

689
00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:37,239
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's surfing the net looking for</font>

690
00:27:34,989 --> 00:27:38,739
things that it could make for dinner so

691
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:41,049
when you come home<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see a nice list</font>

692
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:43,749
of possible recipes for dinner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

693
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:45,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">could extrapolate this idea right you</font>

694
00:27:43,749 --> 00:27:48,849
could be on vacation and you get an

695
00:27:45,609 --> 00:27:50,139
email and it's from your refrigerator it

696
00:27:48,849 --> 00:27:51,879
says you know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much milk</font>

697
00:27:50,139 --> 00:27:53,649
is left but you put it in there three

698
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:56,139
weeks ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's going to crawl out on</font>

699
00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:58,299
its own if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't do something or</font>

700
00:27:56,139 --> 00:28:00,879
maybe you're shopping and you get an SMS

701
00:27:58,299 --> 00:28:02,739
it's your refrigerator again don't

702
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:04,469
forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> the marinara sauce everything</font>

703
00:28:02,739 --> 00:28:07,090
else I need for spaghetti dinner tonight

704
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:09,399
now there there's not so good<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

705
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,699
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this wonderful future me that's</font>

706
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:14,320
suppose for the sake of argument that

707
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:17,559
the Japanese have invented an

708
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,359
internet-enabled bathroom scale when you

709
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,009
step on the scale it figures out which

710
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:22,809
family member you are based on your

711
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:24,369
weight and it sends that information to

712
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:26,289
the doctor and it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of your</font>

713
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,939
medical record which on the surface

714
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:31,059
doesn't sound too bad but there's only

715
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:36,519
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem the refrigerator is on the</font>

716
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:38,499
same network so you come home and you

717
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:40,599
see diet recipes coming up on the

718
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:43,029
display or maybe it just refuses to open

719
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:46,119
this terrible is this an awful future

720
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:47,889
well I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time to pick on all</font>

721
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:50,259
these other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but I wanted to</font>

722
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:51,969
mention a couple of ideas you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you</font>

723
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:53,529
know when we send astronauts up into

724
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,299
space we send them up there with

725
00:28:53,529 --> 00:28:57,039
instrumented clothing so we can keep

726
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:59,320
track<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their vital signs to make sure</font>

727
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,330
that they're okay and I thought well gee

728
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:03,070
what would happen if all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our clothes</font>

729
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,799
were internet and able you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

730
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:09,639
could you do well let's see you could

731
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:11,589
send an SNMP message to the sock<font color="#CCCCCC"> drawer</font>

732
00:29:09,639 --> 00:29:13,389
and you'd get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back a report saying you</font>

733
00:29:11,589 --> 00:29:18,039
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are 17 matched pairs of socks</font>

734
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:19,959
but sock number<font color="#E5E5E5"> 144</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> L is missing so</font>

735
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:23,649
you'd send a multicast message around

736
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:26,470
the house get back a note saying you

737
00:29:23,649 --> 00:29:29,289
know hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is sock 144 l I'm under the</font>

738
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:31,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">sofa in the living room so we just</font>

739
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:33,129
solved the problem of the missing sock

740
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:36,070
and it's a wonderful<font color="#E5E5E5"> contribution to</font>

741
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:37,928
society I have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you this group is</font>

742
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,779
absolutely the best one to tell that

743
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:43,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">story to because you you actually know</font>

744
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,759
what all those acronyms mean well

745
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:49,809
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another possibility though and</font>

746
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:51,179
it's one that is quite real sensor

747
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:53,619
networks are becoming an increasingly

748
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:56,230
common part of the internet environment

749
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:58,629
and you can kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see why I mean to</font>

750
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,640
gather the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have to put</font>

751
00:29:58,629 --> 00:30:01,830
it somewhere people

752
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,500
have to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and so the net is</font>

753
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:07,889
a very natural place to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> all that</font>

754
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:11,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">stuff and I got actually begun to</font>

755
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:13,560
experience this myself I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother</font>

756
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:15,660
checking to see whether I could get this

757
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:19,190
information online so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is these are</font>

758
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:23,220
just can images but I have an ipv6

759
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:25,230
6lowpan network running in my house it's

760
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,170
a commercial<font color="#E5E5E5"> product from a company</font>

762
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:33,240
temperature humidity and light levels

763
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:35,580
with two different sensors in every room

764
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,290
in the house and it's gathering these

765
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:39,810
samples every five minutes now my

766
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,070
purpose in installing it was first of

767
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">all I thought it'd be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool to have an</font>

ipv6 network at<font color="#CCCCCC"> home but second I</font>

769
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,190
actually wanted at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least a year's worth</font>

770
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,830
of information so that i could then

771
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,780
analyze the results to see how well the

772
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:53,610
heating the ventilation and air

773
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,200
conditioning had worked for the course

774
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:58,530
of the year as we go through the seasons

775
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,060
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> northern virginia so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i could see all</font>

776
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:02,129
of this information for every<font color="#E5E5E5"> room in</font>

777
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:04,700
the house<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course the most important</font>

778
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:07,500
room in the house is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the wine cellar and</font>

779
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:09,480
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also instrumented and you can</font>

780
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine keeping things below 60 degrees</font>

781
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,660
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a humidity over 80% was very</font>

782
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,820
important the system is self-organizing

783
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,860
and so although this is an eye chart all

784
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:22,740
those various lines are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the measure of</font>

785
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,290
radio level signal levels between the

786
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,270
various sensors the sensors are actually

787
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:30,000
acting as<font color="#E5E5E5"> store-and-forward devices in</font>

788
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:32,670
addition to capturing information so

789
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,280
it's a self-organizing network that

790
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:39,930
tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain connectivity even when</font>

791
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:42,899
some links break when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

792
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,370
data the summary data once against<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

793
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,140
eye chart but what you're seeing is the

794
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,060
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all the sensors that are in the</font>

795
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:51,960
house plus the temperature and humidity

796
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:53,399
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> light levels on each and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

797
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,950
get slightly more detailed information

798
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:59,340
looking at this sensor in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wine</font>

799
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:01,440
cellar you get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense of you know</font>

800
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:04,050
how how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> variation there was in</font>

801
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,150
temperature not very much<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually less</font>

802
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:08,070
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a degree or light levels in fact</font>

803
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,170
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the spiking light levels will</font>

804
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,450
tell you that somebody went in to the

805
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,669
wine cellar

806
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,440
as the lights got turned on I'm always

807
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:19,100
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when I'm away in</font>

808
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,159
particular but as somebody did point out

809
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,600
to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the system is incomplete and</font>

810
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,760
I have to admit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably right</font>

811
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,019
because I can't tell which bottles are

812
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,100
in the cellar I only know what

813
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:30,500
temperature they're out what the

814
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:33,260
humidity is maybe the door opened and

815
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,350
closed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was suggested that I should</font>

816
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:39,350
put RFID chips on each bottle and an

817
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:41,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">RFID sensor in the in the wine cellar</font>

818
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,928
and so I could tell if a bottle left the

819
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,700
wine cellar without my permission

820
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:49,010
someone has pointed out to me that RFID

821
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,500
doesn't work well<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't penetrate</font>

822
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:55,429
water very well in since wine is about

823
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:57,889
99% water this could probably turn out

824
00:32:55,429 --> 00:33:00,649
to be a difficulty but setting aside

825
00:32:57,889 --> 00:33:02,479
that problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I still have an incomplete</font>

826
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:04,279
design right because somebody could go

827
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,049
in drink the wine leave the bottle there

828
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,570
and I don't know if the bottles empty or

829
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:10,668
full so I need another sensor in the

830
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:13,370
cork that tells whether or not I have

831
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:15,380
any wine inside and if I'm going to that

832
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:17,600
much trouble I might as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well put in some</font>

833
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,279
sensors that detect the esters that are

834
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,570
in the bottle so I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

835
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:23,090
figure out whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the bottles</font>

836
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:25,220
got to the point where it's ready to

837
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:27,830
drink at the very<font color="#E5E5E5"> least I should be able</font>

838
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:30,260
to record in each bottle temperature<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

839
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,120
humidity and so on for every you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a</font>

840
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,730
few minutes interval so I have a history

841
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">of each bottle and that way you before</font>

842
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:38,360
you open the wine<font color="#CCCCCC"> you interrogate the</font>

843
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,340
cork to find out the history of the

844
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,610
bottle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know if you discover that</font>

845
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:45,350
on you know july 4th 2004 the

846
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:47,899
temperature caught up to 102 degrees

847
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:49,370
because the cooling system failed that's

848
00:33:47,899 --> 00:33:52,070
the bottle you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give to somebody he</font>

849
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:54,139
doesn't know the difference and so so I

850
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:56,029
clearly have some development work to do

851
00:33:54,139 --> 00:33:57,439
but the point I want to make is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

852
00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:00,039
sensor systems are going to become

853
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">increasingly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common as part of the net</font>

00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,310
already seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> contemplating sensors</font>

857

and sundry hazardous substances or other

I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about I know at Google we</font>

scrambled to update a lot of our

in response to that revelation Google's

also released recently an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android</font>

you'll be seen mobiles from t-mobile

coming out using that operating system

947

soon this month and we also released<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

the downloading the let's say the overly

973
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:09,630
permissive browsers are effectively an

to ruin<font color="#E5E5E5"> your laptop anymore what they</font>

978
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:22,410
want is to Shanghai those machines to be

979
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:25,260
part of their botnet armies and so the

now being used to generate spam being

used to mount denial of service attacks

984
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,450
there was a while when I thought those

985
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,250
people wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to destroy the internet</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I realize now that they don't want</font>

987
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,119
to do that they want to keep it running

988
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> business for them they</font>

989
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:47,340
rent out their botnet armies for other

00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:59,609
it kills its host it doesn't propagate

995
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,260
itself so I've even heard stories and I

996
00:39:59,609 --> 00:40:02,700
don't know how much credibility to put

1004
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,650
armies and so you know somehow we ought

1005
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to twist that around and</font>

1006
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:25,910
being useful for us but I'm not quite

1007
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure exactly how to do that I think also</font>

1008
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:31,140
one can anticipate an increasing amount

1009
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,720
of social networking taking place and

1010
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:37,560
we've all seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook and MySpace and</font>

1011

<font color="#E5E5E5">orchid second life and so on all I can</font>

1012
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">tell is that those activities including</font>

1013
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:44,310
video gaming are increasing that more

1014
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:46,140
and more people are finding this a

1015
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:49,950
useful and interesting way of spending

1016
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:53,129
time I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend just a moment on</font>

1017
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,710
IPTV because it turns out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all</font>

1018
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,440
practical purposes most people who talk

1019
00:40:55,710 --> 00:41:01,980
about

1020
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:04,350
IPTV are thinking mostly streaming video

1021
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,540
and I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to suggest to you that</font>

1022
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:09,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">streaming video is a very narrow view</font>

1023
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:12,300
what we can do with TV or video on the

1024
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:15,300
internet let's imagine for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sake of</font>

1025
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:17,880
discussion that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are living in Sweden</font>

1026
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,130
soph home if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> living in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Kyoto or</font>

1027
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,840
another part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Japan where you can get</font>

1028
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:25,020
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet at speeds in</font>

1029
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:27,750
excess of a gigabit per second if you

1030
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,400
actually have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of access then</font>

1031
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:32,370
downloading an hour's worth of video

1032
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,040
takes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 seconds maybe more if</font>

1033
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:37,109
it's an HDTV hour but the fact is that

1034
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,080
that's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kind of video on</font>

1035
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:41,910
demand then what we're typically taught

1036
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,590
to think about which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply beginning</font>

1037
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:47,040
the streaming video as somebody clicks

1038
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:49,380
on something if you look at people use

1039
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:51,570
iPods for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example they download their</font>

1040
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:54,150
songs faster than they can listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1041
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:55,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">them and then they play them back you</font>

1042
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,170
can imagine doing the same thing with

1043
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,270
video in fact those of you who use

1044
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">YouTube will have already noticed that</font>

1045
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:05,460
the little<font color="#E5E5E5"> download bar is running ahead</font>

1046
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:07,440
of the presentation of the video so<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1047
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:09,600
some sense that's downloading faster

1048
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,130
than real time and you're simply

1049
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:14,430
catching up while<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're watching it</font>

1050
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:17,670
being displayed so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

1051
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:19,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">are I think it's highly likely that if</font>

1052
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:21,480
the internet speeds<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to rise at</font>

1053
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:24,090
the edges and<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course if the core</font>

1054
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,160
keeps up that people will find new ways

1055
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,690
of using video that have nothing to do

1056
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,480
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of scheduled broadcast</font>

1057
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:32,580
that is been the hallmark of

1058
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,900
conventional television so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1059
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:37,080
racing home to watch an eight o'clock

1060
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,180
broadcast or something you can simply

1061
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:41,730
have it automatically downloaded or

1062
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:43,560
download<font color="#CCCCCC"> it at your leisure and then</font>

1063
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,660
play it back now those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who use</font>

1064
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,279
tivo or personal video recorders have

1065
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,500
already experienced the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time shifting</font>

1066
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,680
that's possible but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to this</font>

1067
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:56,010
than just the time shifting if we in

1068
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:59,100
fact are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font>

1069
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:01,650
transfer files of video content those

files<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they're packetized can</font>

1071
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:05,550
carry everything not just audio and

1072
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,200
video but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can carry you know the book</font>

1073
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,970
that's associated with the movie the

biography<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the actors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and actresses</font>

and the

1076
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:14,829
director a game<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes along with</font>

1077
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:16,930
this with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular entertainment</font>

1078
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:19,270
there may be some other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1079
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:21,098
information maybe even a program it's

1080
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:22,540
all coming to you by way of packets

1081
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:24,460
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packets don't care what they</font>

1082
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,369
contain they just know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they have a</font>

1083
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:29,049
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bits to be delivered well that</font>

1084
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:31,000
suggests<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me that advertising</font>

1085
00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:33,099
information could be incorporated<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

1086
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,869
this now some of you might immediately

1087
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:36,490
say advertising I hate television

1088
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:38,829
advertising it gets in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1089
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:40,868
everything and you're right typical

1090
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:43,270
advertising interrupts the show its

1091
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:45,880
temporal and it drives everybody crazy

1092
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:47,319
and they use tivo to skip over them I'd

1093
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,790
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to suggest to you that we've</font>

1094
00:43:47,319 --> 00:43:51,250
learned something at Google about

1095
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:52,869
advertising mainly that<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody wants it</font>

1096
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,000
unless it has information in it that

1097
00:43:52,869 --> 00:43:57,430
they care about and then oddly enough

1098
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,410
advertising isn't annoying advertising

1099
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:01,690
is useful information but only if you're

1100
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:04,000
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so why not let people</font>

1101
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:05,859
have some control over the advertising

1102
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,069
that they see in the video medium in the

1103
00:44:05,859 --> 00:44:10,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">same way that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> control over</font>

1104
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:13,240
advertising when you're surfing the net

1105
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you're clicking on if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decide to</font>

1106
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,160
click on some search result that

1107
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:20,559
includes an advertisement<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the Google</font>

1108
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,598
service so imagine for a moment that

1109
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,040
while you're watching the video that

1110
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:26,319
some of the objects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">field of view are sensitive to touch</font>

1112
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,690
that or to mouse click so maybe there's

1113
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:34,839
a Mercedes Benz or maybe a nice bottle

1114
00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:37,240
of wine or<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice maybe it's a Macintosh</font>

1115
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:38,859
laptop that's in the field of view and

1116
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:41,529
as you mouse over at little window pops

1117
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:44,410
up saying oh I see you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:46,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the Macintosh that's here and if you</font>

1120
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:49,990
say well yeah there's an apple store

1121

like to buy one click here well this

1125
00:44:57,099 --> 00:45:02,500
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interactive advertising is quite</font>

1126
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:04,598
foreign to the traditional means of

1127
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,099
video in television but I predict<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1128
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:08,500
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a very common way for</font>

people to get useful information from

1130
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,829
that medium rather than the one that

1131
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:13,829
we're all annoyed by

<font color="#CCCCCC">that the internet despite its age still</font>

typical telephone call<font color="#E5E5E5"> lasts for three</font>

1145
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:56,160
minutes and has a nice bell-shaped curve

1146
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:58,470
this helps you design how many lines you

1147
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,060
need for example to reduce the

1148
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:03,000
probability of<font color="#E5E5E5"> not getting a dial tone</font>

to less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> one percent or whatever the</font>

good reason for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a telephone call is</font>

a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing it's a 64 kilobit</font>

1158
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:26,700
property that the applications are very

1159
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,470
in their demand for capacity so you

1160
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,089
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be mouse clicking and sending a</font>

1161
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:31,589
few bits per second and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden</font>

1162
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,260
the next click has 100 megabit per

00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:36,210
second file transfer fired up and no

1164
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:38,130

again so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very good air</font>

1169
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:48,360
long formulas which makes network design

1170
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,070
hard and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> suspect that part of your</font>

1171
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,590
lives are colored by the fact that the

1172
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">designers don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have all the tools that</font>

1173
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,210
they have in the traditional telecom

00:46:54,870 --> 00:47:00,120
world to figure out exactly what

qos debate too deeply here except to say

1178
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:09,600
that I've oscillated on alternate

1179
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:13,200
Tuesdays between the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument that</font>

1180
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need mechanisms to assure certain</font>

1181
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,689
kinds of performance to users<font color="#CCCCCC"> who need</font>

1182

00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:22,390
and on one side<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then on</font>

1185
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,618
<font color="#CCCCCC">just build more capacity into the net</font>

with high-capacity networking suggested

1188
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,359
that building special quality of service

1189
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,310
mechanisms into the system did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not do as</font>

1190

<font color="#CCCCCC">well in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of delivered results as</font>

simply building a bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network there</font>

1192
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:43,119
are arguments on both sides of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

1193
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,800
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bigger Network guys</font>

1194
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,710
win because that this means higher

1195
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,619
capacity for everybody we talked about

1196
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:53,020
internationalized domain names already

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network poses interesting</font>

1198
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,200
opportunities and challenges for people

1199
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:58,119
who want to design distributed

1200
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:00,069
algorithms we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole lot of</font>

1201
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:02,349
applications that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are really distributed</font>

1202
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,750
in the net but over time I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1203
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:07,000
and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them will arise especially</font>

1204
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:10,510
is the sensor networks become part of

1205
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,430
our application or as data centers like

1206
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:16,480
the ones that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google builds or Amazon</font>

1207
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:19,240
bills or or Microsoft builds all of

1208
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:21,310
these various<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed systems are</font>

1209
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,779
best used if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually run</font>

1210
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:26,020
algorithms that can make use of

1211
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,339
computing in more than one location we

1212
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:28,839
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into all this so I</font>

1213
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:31,570
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one thing I am embarrassed</font>

1214
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:34,839
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet's design does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not do</font>

1215
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:37,359
well with mobility the original mobility

1216
00:48:34,839 --> 00:48:39,580
was focused primarily on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packet</font>

1217
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,580
radio network which allowed plenty of

1218
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:44,319
mobility within one networks operation

1219
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:46,660
so as you move from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> place to another</font>

1220
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,940
the packet radio network kept track of

1221
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,040
where you were kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like roaming</font>

1222
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:55,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">within not roaming but try moving around</font>

1223
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:57,730
within a given local telephone system

1224
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:59,830
mobile telephone system where the base

1225
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:00,900
stations are handing off from one to the

1226
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:03,730
other because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know where you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1227
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same kind of mobility</font>

1228
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:07,420
that we're experiencing today what we

1229
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:08,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience today is we move from one</font>

1230
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,540
access point in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to some</font>

1231
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:13,359
other one we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a plane and we move</font>

1232
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:15,520
someplace where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go you know drive 100</font>

1233
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:17,290
miles and we're actually connected to a

1234
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,080
different part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different topology</font>

1235
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:22,210
of the network and we don't do very well

1236
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:25,029
if you've looked at mobile IP and v4 and

1237
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:27,580
v6 you'll find that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

1238
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:30,260
efficient kind of

1239
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:32,420
management of mobile operation and the

1240
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:35,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that in part is that we bound</font>

1241
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:39,110
the IP address too tightly to<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and</font>

1242
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:40,850
UDP it wasn't obvious<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the time this</font>

1243
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:42,770
design work was being done but looking

1244
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:46,220
at it today it's clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need to</font>

1245
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:48,170
break that binding somehow that same

1246
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:49,790
solution by breaking the binding and

1247
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:52,070
having endpoint identifiers that are

1248
00:49:49,790 --> 00:49:54,500
unique and independent of and associated

1249
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:56,750
with IP addresses would also solve the

1250
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:58,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing problem because then it be</font>

1251
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:01,220
possible to accept traffic from multiple

1252
00:49:58,850 --> 00:50:03,319
sources that have assigned you different

1253
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,990
IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then higher level up</font>

1254
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:08,960
sees all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as part of a common and</font>

1255
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:11,629
um communication this would also help us

1256
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,090
with multipath routing because today we

1257
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:15,920
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write routing algorithms that</font>

1258
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:18,500
find a path and stick with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> until</font>

1259
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,880
something goes wrong and then switches

1260
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,760
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another one but sometimes there are</font>

1261
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,500
multiple paths between pairs of points

1262
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:26,300
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the net and we can get more capacity</font>

1263
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:28,100
from end to end if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would allow the</font>

1264
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:30,590
traffic to go over more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one path at</font>

1265
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,080
a time another embarrassment is

1266
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:34,760
broadcast in some sense we take

1267
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,830
broadcast media and we turn them into

1268
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:38,930
point-to-point media that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

1269
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:41,500
what we've done with 802 11 for example

1270
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:43,310
it whereas there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some cases where</font>

1271
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,990
broadcasting would actually be very

1272
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,850
efficient if you need to move the same

1273
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">information to a large</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number of parties</font>

1274
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,660
then transmitting by<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadcast is</font>

1275
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,089
actually very efficient so I imagine

1276
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:54,799
having a satellite transmitting down to

1277
00:50:53,090 --> 00:50:57,290
a million receivers and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

1278
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:59,420
wanted to get the same piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of code or</font>

1279
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,560
the same entertainment information<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

1280
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">could all get it very efficiently</font>

1281
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:06,290
whereas sending it one on one to one or

1282
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:07,490
one at a time is very inefficient so we

1283
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:09,740
really should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about taking</font>

important I'm not arguing by the way

1306
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:57,170
that we should insist that there be that

<font color="#E5E5E5">anonymity is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a useful tool but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also important that you'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> invoke strong authenticity when you</font>

1312

00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:20,079
strongly who they are and you can decide

1317
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,079
you don't want to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them</font>

1318
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:24,410
intellectual property protection is

1319
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:26,180
turning out to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">challenge in the network environment</font>

1321
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:31,700
when you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it copyright means</font>

1322
00:52:28,369 --> 00:52:34,700
literally that the right to copy and in

1323
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:36,348
order to enforce copyright you basically

1324
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,990
inhibit people from making<font color="#E5E5E5"> copies of</font>

1325
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:41,119
things illegally but the internet works

1326
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,910
by copying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the only way it works</font>

1327
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,410
you copy stuff from a website download

1328
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it into your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> browser and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you look</font>

00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it so the copyright community in the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet community are kind of</font>

1331
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,329
fundamentally at odds with each other we

1332
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:55,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to come to some resolution here and</font>

1333
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:57,980
I think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is to step back and</font>

1334
00:52:55,069 --> 00:53:00,109
seriously ask whether copyright is the

1335
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,150
correct way in which to protect people's

1336
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:03,558
intellectual property or whether we

1337
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,809
should find other ways of compensating

1338
00:53:03,559 --> 00:53:07,730
the creators of that intellectual

1339
00:53:05,809 --> 00:53:11,000
property without necessarily inhibiting

1340
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:14,960
copying so that's a challenge for the

1341
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,819
lawyers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the engineers law</font>

1348
00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:34,250
abuses occur and they sometimes

1349
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:36,529
originated in one jurisdiction but the

1350
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:39,049

1351
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:43,730
uniform treatment of these kinds of

1352
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:45,288
problems there are agreements sometimes

1353
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:47,059
Interpol being an example of an

1354
00:53:45,289 --> 00:53:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">international agreement that may be</font>

order to do law enforcement in the

1357
00:53:52,130 --> 00:53:57,080
environments but the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is</font>

1358
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:58,610
a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge for that community and</font>

1359
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,490
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we're going to see an</font>

1360
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:03,080
increasing amount of demand for

commonality in treating various kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other bad things happen and in</font>

1364
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:12,530
order to deal with those problems we're

1365
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,360
going to have to seek international

1366
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,460
agreement on you know what's privacy for

1367
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:18,740
example or what what consists of fraud

1368
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:21,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">and what kinds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of abuses are we going to</font>

1369
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:23,000
declare our globally unacceptable from

the social point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1371
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:30,140
attempt to enforce that that position

1372
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:31,790
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to skip this part for a moment</font>

1373
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,400
and then come back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other things</font>

1374
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:37,759
we talked a little about intellectual

00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,940
berners-lee has been working for some

1377
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:45,650
decade now on the Semantic Web and

1378
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:47,300
although I have not dealt too deeply

1379
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:50,270
personally in this I'm beginning to get

1380
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:52,670
quite interested in the idea that we

1381
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:54,650
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be possible to understand</font>

1382
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:56,960
more deeply what the content of the web

1383
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:58,550
is when we're helping people search<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1384
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,760
things so at Google we care a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about</font>

1385
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:03,710
this deeper sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what is the meaning</font>

1386
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:05,570
of the words that we're encountering in

1387
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:07,520
the net we index all those words and

1388
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,990
then we tell you where the words show up

1389
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,750
in the web pages<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we don't know what</font>

1390
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:14,299
they mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in some sense as one</font>

1391
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,640
intern at Google said today we navigate

1392
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:18,500
people to a document wouldn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1393
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,960
interesting if we could navigate them to

1394
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,300
answers and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to do</font>

1395
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,580
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to know what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font>

1396
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,380
was that they were asking and frequently

1397
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:28,549
we don't have that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can only guess at</font>

1398
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,740
what they were interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1399
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:32,150
they wrote down some search terms so the

1400
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:34,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a deeper</font>

1401
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:36,530
semantic understanding is interesting

1402
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:39,110
the problem is that language is

1403
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:41,540
ambiguous so with a small example the

1404
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:43,220
word Jaguar could mean the operating

1405
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,540
system that could mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> car it could</font>

1406
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,899
mean the animal and when somebody

1407
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:49,910
searches for Jaguar we don't know which

1408
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:52,400
Tim berners-lee's idea is that you could

1409
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,379
declare this ambiguity and you could

1410
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,690
codify it you could make it known to the

1411
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,550
software that's doing the searching so

1412
00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:00,650
that as you crawl through the web and

1413
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,970
you find hyperlinks that say is there's

1414
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:03,890
information on that web

1415
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:05,720
page that might be of interest you also

1416
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:08,210
encounter these cement i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call</font>

1417
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,339
them semantic hyperlinks that say by the

1418
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:11,869
way this word is ambiguous there are

1419
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,430
three different meanings and here are

1420
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:16,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">some examples of the three different</font>

1421
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:18,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">uses of the word and as your crawl</font>

1422
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:20,869
software encounters these<font color="#E5E5E5"> clues it</font>

1423
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:23,900
begins to learn more and more about the

1424
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:25,910
ambiguities and possibly a way to deal

1425
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">with them so if somebody says search for</font>

had learned about disambiguating the

supercomputers that we use remotely

things and as time goes on the only way

1441
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:06,589
you can figure out what those digital

1442
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:09,050
things are is to have the software

1443
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:11,779
available that created them so you can

1444
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:13,940
interpret<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so a spreadsheet is a not</font>

1445
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:15,830
very interesting pile of bits unless you

<font color="#E5E5E5">have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> software that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lets you actually</font>

1447
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:21,799
execute the spreadsheet and if you lose

1448
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:24,589
the software then the pile of bits you

1449
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:26,270
have is not very useful I'm worried that

1450
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're already starting to encounter</font>

1451
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:30,890
something called bit rot and I'm what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1452
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:32,900
mean by this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply that we've</font>

1453
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,879
accumulated large files of bits with

1454
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:36,020
very complex structures and then we

1455
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,540
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access to the software</font>

1456
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:40,369
anymore it might happen because someone

1457
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:43,190
stopped serving that software or stop

1458
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:45,740
supporting it it's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me some</font>

1459
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:47,210
of my photo images for example are no

1460
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:49,160
longer interpretable because there's

1461
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,990
some old form of<font color="#E5E5E5"> JPEG</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the latest</font>

software management tool doesn't

1463
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:57,080
recognize it I'm imagining you know the

1464
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:59,900
scenario have my head is as year 3000

1465
00:57:57,080 --> 00:58:02,960
you just did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google search and you</font>

1466
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:05,089
turned up a 1997<font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerPoint file let's</font>

1467
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">even imagine you're running Windows 3000</font>

1468
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:09,920
and you know the question is does it

1469
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,180
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interpret the 1997</font>

1470
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,059
PowerPoint file and the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1471
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,669
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1472
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:16,259
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably also be true even if</font>

1473
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:18,479
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source software that you</font>

1474
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:20,369
were using so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is how do we</font>

1475
00:58:18,479 --> 00:58:22,229
preserve the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> that knows how to</font>

1476
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:24,839
interpret the bits over really long

1477
00:58:22,229 --> 00:58:28,198
periods of time so as to have the

1478
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:31,049
digital world as well preserved as for

1479
00:58:28,199 --> 00:58:34,380
example thousand-year-old vellum

1480
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:37,199
documents are from a period in 1000 AD

1481
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:40,289
or before if we don't do something about

1482
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:43,199
that it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that even our descendants</font>

1483
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:45,059
in the year 2100 will wonder what was

1484
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:46,709
life like in the beginning of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 21st</font>

1485
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:48,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">century and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be able to figure</font>

1486
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:50,609
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out because all they will have is a</font>

1487
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:53,489
pile of uninterpreted<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits to look at</font>

1488
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:57,058
that's us just uninterpretable bits just

1489
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:59,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit rot and I'd like us for us I'd like</font>

1490
00:58:57,059 --> 00:59:02,039
for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our world to be a little more</font>

1491
00:58:59,609 --> 00:59:03,630
visible to our descendants than that so

1492
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:07,439
let me finish up with the formal remarks

1493
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:09,749
with one other quick reminder<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">now we recognize that Mars for example</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to deliver information back what has not</font>

1527

been common however is that these

1534
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:53,039
to develop a standardized set of

protocols for space<font color="#CCCCCC"> communications so</font>

1536
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:56,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the various devices the</font>

1537
01:00:55,109 --> 01:01:01,109
robotic equipment and even the manned

1538
01:00:56,789 --> 01:01:02,609
equipment can intercalate using the same

1539
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:05,098
way that we enter work on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

1540
01:01:02,609 --> 01:01:07,200
now we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually started out thinking</font>

1541
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:10,740
that we could get away with using

1542
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:13,200
standard tcp IP to do this that idea

1543
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:14,848
lasted about an hour and a half<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1544
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing we noticed is that the</font>

1545
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:20,519
distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the planets is</font>

1546
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:22,769
literally astronomical and the at the

1547
01:01:20,519 --> 01:01:25,618
speed of light it takes between three

1548
01:01:22,769 --> 01:01:27,598
and a half and 20 minutes for a signal

1549
01:01:25,619 --> 01:01:29,339
to propagate from Earth to Mars one way

1550
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:30,960
depending on where you know the two

1551
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:32,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">planets are in their respective orbits</font>

1552
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:35,430
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just gets worse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

1553
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:37,200
go to the outer planets so you can

1554
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:39,749
imagine trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do flow control with</font>

1555
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP right you know basically say stop</font>

1556
01:01:39,749 --> 01:01:43,169
and the guy on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other end doesn't</font>

1557
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:44,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear you for 20 minutes and keeps</font>

1558
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:46,319
transmitting it full bore and all the

1559
01:01:44,819 --> 01:01:48,538
packets are falling all over everywhere

1560
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:49,499
so flow control doesn't work very well

1561
01:01:48,539 --> 01:01:51,499
and then there's this other little

1562
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:54,689
problem the planets have a nasty habit

1563
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:56,339
rotating and you know we don't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1564
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to do anything about that and so</font>

1565
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:59,430
if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to something on the</font>

1566
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:00,960

<font color="#CCCCCC">communicate or maybe it's a satellite</font>

1570
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:08,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in orbit and so it's a very</font>

1571
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:10,680
disruptive environment and it's a very

1572
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:12,210
delayed environment so if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:14,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do store-and-forward networking in</font>

1574
01:02:12,210 --> 01:02:15,239
that kind of environment it's very hard

1575
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:18,119
to guess how<font color="#CCCCCC"> long it's going to take</font>

1576
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:19,769
before a message will go from one place

1577
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,140
to another it's a little bit like email

1578
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:24,538
the party you're communicating with an

1579

email may not be online at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1580
01:02:24,539 --> 01:02:28,950
you send the message you don't care you

that we have developed have that

1586
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,650
characteristic we call them delay and

disruption tolerant networking protocols

1588
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:45,760
they've been in development now for

1589
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:47,289
almost a decade we've tested them

exciting thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you is that</font>

this month<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of this month we're</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> October and November we're going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we've been told we may be able to do it</font>

again in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> spring time the purpose</font>

1632
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:33,609
behind those tests is to space qualify

1633
01:04:30,009 --> 01:04:36,369
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTN protocols once they are spaced</font>

1634
01:04:33,609 --> 01:04:37,750
qualified in fact we're also going to be

1635
01:04:36,369 --> 01:04:39,500
uploading to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> International Space</font>

1637
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,940
another years worth of tests on that

1638
01:04:41,390 --> 01:04:46,400
once we complete all those tests in if

1639
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:49,250
they are successful the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTN protocols</font>

1640
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:52,700
will be what's called technology

1641
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:55,280
readiness level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA and JPL by</font>

1642
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:57,680
which NASA and JPL mean that these

1643
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,380
protocols can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used in live missions</font>

1644
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:02,960
so we're hoping by the end of 2009 that

1645
01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:05,360
will have that qualification and we can

1646
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">start putting the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DTN protocols into all</font>

1647
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:11,380
of the mission space missions that all

1648
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:14,270
of the spacefaring countries are

1649
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:16,100
undertaking we've already presented the

1650
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:18,770
idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the consultative committee on</font>

1651
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:20,450
space data systems which standardizes

1652
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:22,160
space communication protocols and

1653
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:24,350
they've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very receptive to the idea</font>

1654
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,080
so what this suggests to me is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font>

1655
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:29,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are successful in our work that as</font>

1656
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:32,480
time goes on and each new mission gets

1657
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:35,210
launched<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will accrete a kind of</font>

1658
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:37,100
interplanetary backbone of devices that

1659
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:40,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capable of interacting with each</font>

1661
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:43,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices on the internet are capable</font>

1662
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:46,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of doing that so we're not trying to</font>

1663
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:47,810
build a big interplanetary backbone and

1664
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:50,779
hope that somebody will come that's not

1665
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:52,670
the the design principle is simply build

1666
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:55,040
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards just like we did with</font>

01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:59,840
same way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet has over the</font>

1669
01:05:57,170 --> 01:06:01,580
decades well that's all the formal

1670
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:03,710
remarks that i am prepared in advance

1671
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:06,140
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm happy to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some time for Q&A</font>

1672
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:10,450
if you're interested and if the

1673
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:10,450
moderator allows it thank you very much

1674
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:22,520
thank you doctor sir we certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1675
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:26,150
have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes for some questions if</font>

1676
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:28,810
people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any don't be odd it's okay</font>

1677
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:31,310
now have a demo oh there's a demo yeah

1678
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:34,070
okay so you can are we still on

1679
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:36,770
microphone is the microphone is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

1680
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:40,130
working now if I clip it to my left

1681
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:43,070
mouse wheel works great for those of you

1682
01:06:40,130 --> 01:06:45,860
who like boys this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the latest toy</font>

1683
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:49,250
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony it's called a rolly anybody</font>

1684
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:53,390
seen the youtubes of this already this

1685
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:56,200
is a four-hundred-dollar toy it's got a

1686
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:58,549
bluetooth interface it has a USB

1687
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:02,359
interface as well for recharging and

1688
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:05,420
programming it lets you download your

1689
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:08,270
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> music and as you'll see momentarily</font>

1690
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:10,160
I hope that I'm not sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1691
01:07:08,270 --> 01:07:12,550
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see this but let's see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1692
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,549
happens

1693
01:08:37,749 --> 01:08:46,880
okay if you aren't right up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1694
01:08:45,139 --> 01:08:49,009
probably couldn't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the best thing</font>

1695
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:53,689
was the tiny<font color="#E5E5E5"> shimmer of the little wings</font>

1696
01:08:49,009 --> 01:08:55,459
on the vibrato oh it's amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> now let</font>

1697
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:57,769
me tell you this there's a there about

1698
01:08:55,459 --> 01:09:01,118
40<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 50</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tunes in this thing some of</font>

1699
01:08:57,769 --> 01:09:03,619
them a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more dramatic than that one</font>

1700
01:09:01,118 --> 01:09:05,749
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's very</font>

1701
01:09:03,618 --> 01:09:07,848
well-engineered it's very precise in its

1702
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:09,788
motions you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can everything is like eight</font>

1703
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:12,619
or nine degrees of freedom in this thing

1704
01:09:09,788 --> 01:09:13,969
and because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the it's lifted off the</font>

1705
01:09:12,618 --> 01:09:15,589
surface of the table by these little

1706
01:09:13,969 --> 01:09:18,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">rubber wheels it can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

1707
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:20,118
around very very precisely so I've been

1708
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,579
thinking that what I should do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

1709
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:25,459
small camera on this thing and a

1710
01:09:22,578 --> 01:09:28,009
microphone and then export it to

1711
01:09:25,459 --> 01:09:29,778
meetings that I can't come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so imagine</font>

1712
01:09:28,009 --> 01:09:31,249
you're sitting at a table conference

1713
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:33,249
table you've got this little thing

1714
01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:37,130
sitting here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you your remote</font>

1715
01:09:33,249 --> 01:09:38,959
over the net and and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to</font>

1716
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:40,729
the conversation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you somebody says</font>

1717
01:09:38,959 --> 01:09:43,130
something you don't agree with so you

1718
01:09:40,729 --> 01:09:44,359
steer this thing over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

1719
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:48,319
say that's the dumbest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I ever</font>

1720
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:50,299
heard you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be</font>

1721
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">incredibly intimidating to have this</font>

1722
01:09:50,299 --> 01:09:55,789
little thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> roll can you let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1723
01:09:52,038 --> 01:09:57,709
think of what you know so and you could

1724
01:09:55,789 --> 01:09:59,209
run more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than one of them at a time so</font>

1725
01:09:57,709 --> 01:10:00,860
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine a multiple screen</font>

1726
01:09:59,209 --> 01:10:02,300
display where you're participating in

1727
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,558
several different meanings you know and

1728
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:05,989
then you buzzing around sort of

1729
01:10:03,559 --> 01:10:08,449
hollering and everybody has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1730
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:10,339
so that's for people who are you know

1731
01:10:08,449 --> 01:10:12,199
interested in really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool stuff there's</font>

1732
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:14,269
a piece of software that comes with it

1733
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:16,688
as far as I know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> only works on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC</font>

1734
01:10:14,269 --> 01:10:20,479
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a mac which is too bad for</font>

1735
01:10:16,689 --> 01:10:22,099
choreography any of you who've ever done

1736
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:23,929
video where you've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> video</font>

1737
01:10:22,099 --> 01:10:25,579
cuts to go with the beat of the music no

1738
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:28,219
that's a fairly big challenge this is

1739
01:10:25,579 --> 01:10:34,030
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> worse because well in fact let's</font>

1740

see if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get if we really</font>

1744
01:10:53,210 --> 01:11:18,679

that's cold though we got a little

1746
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:33,260
rhythm we got a little melody we put

1747
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:37,009
them both together we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> song</font>

coffee they drank this one there's a

1757

certain amount of that I'm actually

1758
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:12,520
surprised that there's no more questions

1759
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:14,469
on the interplanetary internet because i

1760

01:12:14,469 --> 01:12:17,679
or thirty percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks here</font>

those<font color="#E5E5E5"> network elements into your network</font>

1765
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:25,059
designs I thought you guys would have

1766
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">more questions it's all right not to</font>
