do you care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this which is there</font>

about v4 and v6 coexistence and

this and you are deploying v6 please

catch me elsewhere because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

hopefully the last go-round on this

fantasy this is the real talk um<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv an</font>

carrier-grade NAT which

59
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,189
heard about here before a gang of us are

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,230
working on this alternative to it the

61
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:39,599
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement is as you've heard</font>

62
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,988
here before large broadband providers

63
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,018
have an edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so big that they</font>

can't get enough v4 space to assign a 32

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a real problem so the how does</font>

67
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,680
that out of how do those five Jillian

68
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,079
users get connectivity from their homes

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,939
its consumer space problem it's not an

70
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:05,430
enterprise space problem why I'm

71
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:06,750
concerned<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is because what</font>

72
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,079
they're suggesting is something called

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:13,469
carrier-grade NAT which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the</font>

coal this isn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> working I</font>

00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:21,209
probably have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn it on or something</font>

76
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:29,310
radical like that now it says on boopity

but my<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is the way this that</font>

87
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:11,750
happens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a gnat in the</font>

I don't want to broadband minute but I

is because then acts in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core of the</font>

94
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:40,550
try skype version 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> beware he just fixes</font>

96
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:46,160
and we try it would stop the problem of

97
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:49,370
walled gardens I want a nice pretty

98
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,960
picture of a walled garden um you know

99
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,180
with flowers and everything I googled

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the went to Google Images googled walled</font>

101
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:01,000
garden and this is what I got oh this is

102
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,000
why not

103
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,389
it's not really correct and Steve

104
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:20,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">velleman gave us a more correct picture</font>

105
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:23,960
which is this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people give them</font>

00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:26,419
bad performance right knee before people

in see having trouble doing reasonable

112
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:49,939
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so dose is not inevitable</font>

113
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:52,309
what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do put the net there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

cpe where the customer determines their

own fate but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the heck can i do that</font>

117
00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:03,469
i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough the four addresses</font>

118
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:07,219
to give each one of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> cps before</font>

119
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:11,449
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be difficult but allah</font>

120
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:12,979
says we can redeploy cps out there and

121
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:15,259
the scheme<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm proposing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even does</font>

122
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:16,878

00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,879
roll them out as part of a new contract

if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't roll cps immediately then</font>

125
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,709
run a dual stack or you already have

126

hacked address space around<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok how it</font>

163
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,790
works is the v4 data you take a

well-known v6 prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and you make the</font>

stolen the destination is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font>

169

prefix + the real v4 destination so it

170
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:49,029
does normal v6 rowdy and get the

171
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:51,640
appropriate border on there the v6 is d

172
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:56,829
capsulated it's gotta be for destination

173
00:09:51,640 --> 00:10:00,730
inside off it goes ok normal routings

border routers have no state or scaling

184

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:36,279
into details so cp's change border

endlessly with but how does this part

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,510
work how does that part work<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc so</font>

201
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:19,719
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of extra</font>

even though these are lightning talks in

204
00:11:21,699 --> 00:11:26,769
between each so I'll get that unless

205
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:29,979
they're 20 14 oh come on Dean<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit oh</font>

206
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,750
then beats you to it he's wily and older

207
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:36,089
no I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to young three questions</font>

208
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:39,389
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ready thank you</font>

209
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:41,910
for your usual enthusiasm have you

210
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:44,040
actually implemented infested so that we

211
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,600
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some idea that we do have any more</font>

212
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:50,189
than just we have a do we have a hack

213
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,860
implementation yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

214
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:56,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this are 64 is a p.i prefix right</font>

215
00:11:52,860 --> 00:12:00,930
so there's our do you plan to have some

216
00:11:56,249 --> 00:12:03,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">aggregated address you talk talking</font>

217
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:06,239
about the hack v such well-known prefix

218
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:09,589
it makes no<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference what it is if</font>

219
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:15,089
you'll notice the particular one I chose

220
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:18,120
um should tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> chief or fourth</font>

221
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:20,970
oh yeah but considering considering it

222
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,439
started with a for you should know that

223
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's magic and really makes no</font>

224
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:26,399
difference what it is well what I'm

225
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,258
worried about is that you don't want to

226
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,209
do flat logging on sites for these sites

227
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:33,740
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't get before addresses in the</font>

228
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:38,279
visas<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is a</font>

229
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:41,459
broadband provider yes with a jillion

230
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:43,079
pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the cpe edge but every night</font>

231
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:45,569
they would like navigate those as well

232
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:49,370
as of regions of an hour right right

233
00:12:45,569 --> 00:12:52,979
works perfectly<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because they</font>

234
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,410
slam out there before<font color="#E5E5E5"> is aggregated</font>

235
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,079
already they already are used to I mean

236
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:00,660
why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lan talk but they're</font>

237
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,689
used to I've seen higher the next set of

this that's a physics lesson boy in the

this can be /c are you doing like this

241
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:19,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I think that was a lightning enough</font>

242
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:21,660

243
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:25,229
quote somebody let's have a great deal

244

248
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,040
into account because we don't want to be

<font color="#E5E5E5">in the business of running your</font>

and if you can deploy things with lower

00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:46,419
energies even better so we are

customer control of their part of that
