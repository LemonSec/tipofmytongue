10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,310
for a consultancy firms so i can answer

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,509
a question and i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> even like to take</font>

12

money from you answering<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

this is we've talked about this many

some feedback on stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

18
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,940
actually deployed and and how it's

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,469
performed so problem really simple a few

20
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,449

cisco just we have most experience with

22
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:52,879
so I'm just mentioning a couple very

to some devices when the forwarding

34
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,399

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,090
the whole table why can't my router

71
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,190
software simply do some aggregation say

72
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,420
well you know this aggregate able chunk

73
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,850

<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe the vendors don't want to do the</font>

77

conspiracy theory there are lots of

80
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,550
other reasons why but the point is it

81
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,700
doesn't work right now that way unless

82
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:04,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">it does somebody tell me and I'll start</font>

pitching that gear the current solution

84
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,649
is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> bind your hardware sometimes</font>

85
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,880
you're just really simple you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull out</font>

00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,350
centralized forwarding sometimes you

89
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">gotta upgrade</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> every single line card in</font>

forwarding sometimes and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again</font>

92
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,600
real world that we run into yeah you can

93
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,950
replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> a minute the manager module but</font>

94
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,870
all those manager modules fit in

95
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,339
different slots in the chassis oh and

96
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,140
you need higher speed fan cards oh and

97
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to go to 208 volt because you</font>

98
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,040
need more wattage and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to swap</font>

99
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:33,720
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> your power supplies too and you know</font>

100
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,100
that fan card is actually blocked by a

101
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,940
whole bunch of Ethernet cables and you

102
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,090
can't just swap it out without

103
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,730
unplugging half your cables so we run

104
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,020
into these problems is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there it except</font>

105
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the workaround something to buy you time</font>

106
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,850
this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a permanent fix but can we</font>

107
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,230
buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some time it's got to be quick</font>

108
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:51,299
it's got to be easy it's got to be

109
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,549
inexpensive you need to retain as much

110
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,959
relevant routing information in your

111
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">table as possible because again you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

112
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,650
for traffic engineering statistics and

113
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:02,190
you need to maintain what I call routing

114
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,660
accuracy so the short answer you got to

115
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,739
abbreviate the routing table from your

116
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:09,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP routes what's routing accuracy what</font>

117
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:11,550
I define is routing actor is how much

118
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:15,120
traffic we can still forward without

119
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,890
following the default route anything

120
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,959
that can't follow a shorter match and it

121
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,060
goes out the default that's considered

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,750
inaccurate it's not the end of the world

123

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's not</font>

130
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,960
very first thing you must do is make

131
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,580
sure all of your ISPs in addition the

132

full table are setting you default

133
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,280
because there will be some traffic that

you will no longer have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

of the long prefixes and you check your

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll give you some pointers so we had a</font>

153
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:24,780
we had a goal to try to achieve over

154
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,890
ninety percent rounding accuracy and my

155
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,169
personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal was ninety-nine percent</font>

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:30,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">routing accuracy and still allow the</font>

159
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:39,720
did pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple 91 / 8 just because I</font>

160
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,900
91 / A's kind of a curious block that

161
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,750
was allocated according to documentation

162
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,789
was allocated to / 29 me personally I'm

163
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,370
happy rounding / 24 s on the public

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:52,680

allow up to / 24 for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> class full a</font>

173
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,450
was done first time we did this was in

174
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,620
May of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juno 2008 not the first time</font>

175
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,110
that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually did this we had</font>

176
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,910
a couple networks which were at 250 250

177
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,440
3,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> miles saying whoa we're gonna</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">follow</font>

179
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,750
over any day so we managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce</font>

180
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,099
them from 253 299 thousand which fit

181
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,910
very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice thing to give them some</font>

182
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:33,290
breathing room looking looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> past into</font>

183
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,810
September those same networks are now

184
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,390
sitting at 205,000 routes again<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

185
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,260
healthy and buy them you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

186
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if they're going to have a month</font>

187
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,990
two months seven months maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten months</font>

188
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,940
before they need to really make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

189
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,580
they get those those new devices in

190
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,050
there as far as accuracy in these cases

191
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,940
on three different networks were able to

192
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:51,500
maintain better than ninety-nine percent

193
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,870
accuracy so it means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on a network</font>

194
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:58,300
running 1.5 gigabit per second at peak

195
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:00,500
time their default route was only a

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,320
transiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9 megabit per second of the</font>

network 300 mag peak foreign 50 kilobit

198
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,040
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> largest network I did this on</font>

199
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 gigabit per second network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

202
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,190
route meaning those 54,000 routes we

203
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:20,479
threw away<font color="#E5E5E5"> were not very relevant to</font>

204
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:23,420
that Network a few tips what we tried to

205
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,190
do here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is apply few broad strokes and</font>

206
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,690
just get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other work first of all</font>

207
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,950
we built by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hour and you know we</font>

208
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:30,230
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and really want to</font>

209
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:32,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend a hundred hours having us now fine</font>

210
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">tune the table but the same time if I</font>

211
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,960
can do a few broad stroke changes and

212
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,400
fix the problems i<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go on news any</font>

213
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,140
more interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we know that</font>

214
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,190
did at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it all they're going</font>

215
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have to buy some more hardware</font>

216
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,490
eventually or<font color="#CCCCCC"> there have to spend a time</font>

217
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,659
and actually implemented don't dwell on

218
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,910
middleman locations there are a couple

219
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,919
examples and the nanog threads and the

220
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:51,110
archives a few very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart people</font>

221
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,380
giving very good advice where they're

222
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:58,610
building pretty complex prefix filter

223
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:00,350
sets based on minimal allocations um it

224
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,490
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of work it seemed</font>

225
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:03,169
like you were maybe throwing a little

226
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">too much it was relevant away maybe</font>

227
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,859
keeping a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little too much just isn't it</font>

228
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:08,270
necessary basically finding diminishing

229
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,330
margin return so you can spend days and

230
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,979
days and days tweaking around table what

231
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:14,479
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen is you're going to reduce</font>

00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">your forwarding table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> size that's true</font>

233
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,950
you're definitely going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to significantly</font>

234
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">reduce your accuracy as well and if that</font>

235
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:23,750
was a goal of<font color="#CCCCCC"> yours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

236
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,090
do it so anyway broad strokes go make a

237
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:30,200
VLAN change or ACL change or attend

238
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:31,310
nanog or something well and there's a

239
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,559
question I actually pulled out

240
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,940
another salon just<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know after this</font>

241
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,010
these are

242
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,050
posted right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to show</font>

243
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:39,610
you now but when if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> download the</font>

244
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:41,770
presentation I<font color="#E5E5E5"> threw a couple references</font>

245
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,730
the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> configuration I actually gave</font>

246
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:48,280
it to you and a couple additional

247
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,630
results showing diminishing margin and

248
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,030
if you really curious where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> minimal</font>

249
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:54,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">occasions are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can download the</font>

250
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:57,459
PDF and view them they're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right time</font>

251
00:08:54,970 --> 00:09:01,840
for one or two questions anyway you have

252
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:08,980
anything you all like it that's good

253
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:11,050
prob heading prison mike i<font color="#E5E5E5"> right seized</font>

254
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:18,900
from uh he flipped back to the slide it

255
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:25,959
has the accuracy<font color="#CCCCCC"> one this one yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

256
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:30,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">so i sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of not following the last one</font>

257
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,240
there the smaller clothes

258
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:44,689
yes so I actually did through some this

259
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,220
actually through the packet sniffer

260
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:49,470
following the default path take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

261
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,830
at what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was it was real</font>

262
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:55,580
and user traffic and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just I just</font>

263
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,170
took a sample I mean a mental sample

264
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,490
sorry a visual<font color="#E5E5E5"> human sample of some of</font>

265
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,599
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> destination at p's and look back in</font>

266
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,240
the routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> table and said sure enough</font>

267
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,120
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are for the most part there were</font>

268
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,070
broadband providers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were doing /</font>

269
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,370
twenty-fours and not announcing an

270
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:13,020
aggregate d egg as well sorry not

271
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,070
announcing the aggregate as well there's

272
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:16,650
now single hole splattering of /

273
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:20,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-fours but it was all valid end</font>

274
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:24,140
user traffic yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright that's it for</font>

275
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the questions thank you very much Danny</font>
