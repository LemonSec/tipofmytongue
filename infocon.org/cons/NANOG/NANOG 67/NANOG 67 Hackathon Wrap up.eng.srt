1
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,510
in our last chocolate a a little bit

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:13,540
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lightning talk will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,439
wrap up from the nanog 67 hackathon by

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:16,439
Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swofford</font>

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,259
and we may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take one or two</font>

6
00:00:20,259 --> 00:00:27,579
brief questions but we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it being here</font>

7
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:29,230
to get to thank you so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

8
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,969
talking today just for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,280
about that hackathon we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this past</font>

10
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:35,290
weekend I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of walk you through</font>

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,659
first a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about about what a</font>

12
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,250
hackathon is and then to just give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

13
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:41,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a deep dive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into what we</font>

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,500
were working on and some of the projects

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that came out of this so first what is a</font>

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,540
hackathon well one simple way is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

17
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,369
at it as an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> where a lot of people</font>

18
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">just meet to engage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in collaborative</font>

19
00:00:51,369 --> 00:00:55,619
programming to solve new and interesting

20
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:59,229
problems sometimes with beer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> alcohol</font>

21
00:00:55,619 --> 00:01:01,750
because it's so sometimes we make it

22
00:00:59,229 --> 00:01:04,209
like a party-like atmosphere to add some

23
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,829
of the fun to it so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it mean to</font>

24
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:10,298
hack attack has a few different

25
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,220
definitions here one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to modify a</font>

26
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,860
computer program<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in a skillful or</font>

27
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,619
clever way another is to write computer

28
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,930
programs for enjoyment and finally the

29
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:22,120
one that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool though very close</font>

30
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me is to make something short in a</font>

31
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:26,229
short period of time often<font color="#CCCCCC"> by taking</font>

32
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,880
shortcuts now the last one is kind of

33
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:30,460
interesting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> note because it's the</font>

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,199
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking an idea and skipping the</font>

35
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,330
entire design and discussion and

36
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,340
argument phase with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> co-workers and</font>

37
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,650
just building it trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

38
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,360
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it can work and then once</font>

39
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,040
you have something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works go prove</font>

40
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:46,000
that it could potentially be worthwhile

41
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:48,280
to management or your teammates so type

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,830
some hats there's there's a wide range

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,450
here it doesn't have to be software

44
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:55,270
there are some examples here<font color="#CCCCCC"> of software</font>

45
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,400
for example automating emails that might

46
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:59,860
have come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of yesterday's event of</font>

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,390
hey will you here with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we could</font>

48
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,909
also look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware hack such as the</font>

49
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:05,740
console servers with raspberry PI's and

50
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:08,769
finally even documentation such as

51
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,389
writing a great wiki for your your

52
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:13,590
favorite open source project or

53
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:16,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">something else that you're working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

54
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,519
so as I start talking this this might

55
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,200
sound familiar to your day job<font color="#E5E5E5"> or day</font>

56
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:21,939
jobs of people you work with so why do

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,819
we classify this event as anything

58
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:27,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">special or different it's not just a</font>

59
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:29,768
party even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though some might think that</font>

60
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,480
is but what is really the differentiator

61
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,550
here is that in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> day job you have</font>

62
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,738
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got email the</font>

63
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,379
deal with tickets maybe customers you

64
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">have change requests you hopefully get</font>

65
00:02:38,379 --> 00:02:41,518
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write code if that's part of your job</font>

66
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:44,738
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if that is your main</font>

67
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,629
responsibility that may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be what you</font>

68
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,250
have time for on most days so a

69
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:51,220
hackathon is a right and great way to

70
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:53,920
set the stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of having a mental escape</font>

71
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,379
to go work on that project that's been

72
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,819
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back of your mind for months this</font>

73
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:59,078
problem that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just keep working</font>

74
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:02,738
around and been dating that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just</font>

75
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:04,329
know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had eight or 20 hours which</font>

76
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,370
are a really long hackathon let's say

77
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,099
eight or ten hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just focus on</font>

78
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:12,819
getting a prototype out it's a really

79
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:14,410
cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to just do that and also one</font>

80
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:17,140
note there's if you are participating

81
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:19,000
act them make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> your managers know</font>

82
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,798
and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're aware and</font>

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,329
supportive of it because being able to

84
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:23,920
actually block off time on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font>

85
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:28,180
schedule to really go do this and not

86
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,059
really be on call is something that will

87
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so much more successful for you</font>

88
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:36,280
so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now at Sunday's</font>

89
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,739
hackathon it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pretty big we</font>

90
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,959
had about 50 people a very wide range of

91
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:43,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">people were in attendance from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

92
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,370
and system engineers to academics and

93
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:48,040
students even managers and I believe a

94
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,720
few directors they were from a wide

95
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">range of companies big companies that</font>

96
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,919
everybody had heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too little</font>

97
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:55,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies no one had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of but that</font>

98
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:57,400
didn't matter because we were all

99
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:59,739
participating equally in groups together

100
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,380
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even had people with coding</font>

101
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:04,209
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> and without there were a</font>

102
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,769
couple of really cool projects that are

103
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:07,209
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool projects that</font>

104
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:08,950
came out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so just talking a</font>

105
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:12,489
little bit about what we were working on

106
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:15,399
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Saturday we had one project called</font>

107
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:17,410
am i blocked for example which is

108
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,849
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a remote trigger black</font>

109
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,349
hole detection to see if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

110
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:22,510
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> being blocked out in the</font>

111
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:25,690
wilderness we had another one called

112
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,729
pike on which you saw Brandon talk about

113
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,139
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> console servers using raspberry</font>

114
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:35,590
PI's we also had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> takeoff which we saw</font>

115
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:37,780
yesterday's whoa that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter and I</font>

116
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,039
believe was Brian talked about which is

117
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,630
pre flight testing for your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

118
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:42,280
devices trying to combine all those

119
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,990
manual audits that you normally run off

120
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,580
a mop or a checklist and say hey go run

121
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,590
CLI tool make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the device</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is ready</font>

122
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,780
we also had to buy to a desktop

123
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,909
messaging client Nick info which was a

124
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:55,400
our tap<font color="#E5E5E5"> Klein to aggregate a bunch of</font>

125
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">different data sources such as who is an</font>

126
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,250
errand for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example and net DB a topology</font>

127
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:05,030
database to build a son off box source

128
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,380
of truth so looking at this we actually

129
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,150
spent the whole day with the the

130
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,520
hackathon range from nine thirty in the

131
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,960
morning to 7pm which is a long long

132
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">period of time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just stay focused</font>

133
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,890
working on something what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

134
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,900
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is we didn't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plan</font>

135
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,280
a ton in<font color="#CCCCCC"> advance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but we did a little bit</font>

136
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,099
through an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email list that all the</font>

137
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,590
attendees were on but it really was more

138
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,120
organized that day in prompted and we

139
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,830
had all these different groups and we

140
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,980
just organized tables to kind of

141
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,840
encourage group sitting where there were

142
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,570
tables of six and<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 10 of those set</font>

143
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,429
up and so we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> out the pitch or</font>

144
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning which is some logistics and</font>

145
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,030
some welcoming and then we're like hey

146
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,250
if you have an idea come up here and

147
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:44,929
pitch it and we made everybody become a

148
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,220
salesperson for a bit to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recruit</font>

149
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">people to help them with their idea</font>

150
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,910
which is cool because if you have an

151
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,040
idea that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on and</font>

152
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">make known in the world it gave</font>

153
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,510
everybody an opportunity to advertise

154
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,580
the idea but then they got to recruit

155
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:59,900
random strangers to help them and who

156
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't want random people to help you</font>

157
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,679
write code when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to write a ton</font>

158
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,090
of code so that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked really</font>

159
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,030
well because then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we broke into musical</font>

160
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,969
chairs and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> groups district were</font>

161
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:15,200
completely random but they actually

162
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked really well together looking at</font>

163
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,440
this from a higher level view though it

164
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,990
was kind of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how this</font>

165
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,850
worked out so we didn't prescribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

166
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:25,040
each group was working on and we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

167
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">even define who was in what group they</font>

168
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">just chose where they wanted to sit and</font>

169
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:30,500
if they ran out chairs they<font color="#E5E5E5"> grabbed more</font>

170
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,570
chairs so some girls took a

171
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,920
divide-and-conquer approach which

172
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">brandon's group for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

173
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,700
raspberry PI's did where they broke out

174
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,070
a very large problem so for example

175
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,500
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what he worked on in his</font>

176
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,420
group they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were building console servers</font>

177
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,550
based on raspberry pots where each

178
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">little raspberry pi had one serial</font>

179
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,340
interface or two via USB interfaces and

180
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,050
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> raspberry pi represented a remote</font>

181
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,359
console server and then there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

182
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">little I think Intel nuk for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example a</font>

183
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,090
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> mini micro server that was</font>

184
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,770
like the phone home registration system

185
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,929
and so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different cults of</font>

186
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,599
servers phone home to this little server

187
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,040
to create one giant virtual console

188
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,750
server so that when you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

189
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,700
connect to them instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> connecting to</font>

190
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,610
each individual Raspberry Pi you would

191
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,620
actually log in through the main one it

192
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,560
actually was pretty pretty in depth

193
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,090
because it had a UI<font color="#E5E5E5"> a back-end I believe</font>

194
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,830
it maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> even a database or some</font>

195
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:25,979
integration at that so they broke it out

196
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:28,349
were one person or one group did just

197
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,810
the UI another procession of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group</font>

198
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,100
did just the backend and they worked

199
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,470
independently for a while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then met</font>

200
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,290
agreed on some interface to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

201
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,670
other such as a JSON format and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

202
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,190
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got two different milestones they</font>

203
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:42,450
started bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> them together other</font>

204
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,880
verbs took totally different approaches

205
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:48,360
the group i was in actually took this

206
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,960
approach called pair programming which

207
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,820
is where we basically work together on

208
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,320
the same project but we just simply

209
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:57,630
shared a screen throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day so</font>

210
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,250
for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a shared virtual</font>

211
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:01,950
private server that each of the groups

212
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,240
was given and so in my group we all

213
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,909
logged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the virtual private server</font>

214
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,050
and then we loaded up<font color="#E5E5E5"> janu screen and</font>

215
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just started sharing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

216
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,700
interactive terminal and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

217
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,770
funny because at first I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wasn't even</font>

218
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">planning to like suggest that at first</font>

219
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,280
because I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of scared personally a</font>

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,560
pair programming because I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

221
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,260
few times in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's it's a challenge to</font>

222
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">get started with but one of the guys</font>

223
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,710
suggested hey let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just share a screen</font>

224
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:28,080
session because we were working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

225
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,020
problem that was kind of in depth and

226
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,280
kind of abstract anyway and so what we

227
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,530
did is the first I've person to actually

228
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,659
suggested idea we just made that person

229
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:38,250
go and so it was totally random who

230
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,380
started and then we set a timer for

231
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,200
about 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 20 minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so each</font>

232
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:44,640
person took turns rotating the group of

233
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,960
driving the keyboard<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also partially</font>

234
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,270
driving the design and then we talked

235
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,620
out loud as we did it so even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

236
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,600
weren't entirely sure what we were

237
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,420
building we built it together on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fly</font>

238
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it was really really neat you kind</font>

239
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,719
of just had to be there<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try it that</font>

240
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works really well too because</font>

241
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,560
there was like six of us for a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

242
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,410
so we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of like fed off each</font>

243
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,609
other other<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups took actually I don't</font>

244
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this took place on this</font>

245
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,240
hackathon but in<font color="#CCCCCC"> pass a clones we</font>

246
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,709
commonly see the parallel competition

247
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,740
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the better</font>

248
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,330
mousetrap wins

249
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:15,610
you have a group they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on an idea</font>

250
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,020
but sometimes you can only have one or

251
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,170
two people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're really working on it so</font>

252
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,730
you just do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your own way and then</font>

253
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,339
try to see which way ends up being

254
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:28,120
better instead the idea of code<font color="#CCCCCC"> wins</font>

255
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:30,160
arguments for example and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

256
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,230
note if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hadn't seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> power kroger</font>

257
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,420
mean I actually grabbed the definition

258
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:35,800
off Wikipedia here the way we've tried

259
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:37,360
it at Facebook in my own team it's

260
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,040
typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just two people where we sit</font>

261
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,900
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conference room together and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

262
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,699
a screen but if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried this</font>

263
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:44,790
before it's really interesting and a

264
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:48,430
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way to challenge yourself</font>

265
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:50,620
because it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult in that</font>

266
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,880
it's not hard but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really weird if</font>

267
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,950
you're used to being<font color="#CCCCCC"> solo and</font>

268
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,180
programming like someone myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

269
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,340
example I'm always used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to writing code</font>

270
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,800
on my own and then describing it as I'm

271
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,820
done whereas when you program with two

272
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,880
people in the same room you

273
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:05,800
automatically become a much dumber

274
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,090
person because as you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk out</font>

275
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,920
loud you're like I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm</font>

276
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,080
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard but it</font>

277
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,579
makes you think and forces forces you to

278
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,170
think deeper about how to describe

279
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,810
something when you're describing it to

280
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,370
your peer for example so<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely try</font>

281
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,250
that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't because it looked</font>

282
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:23,380
really well in my group for example and

283
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:25,030
so finally the hackathon kind of ended

284
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,430
with this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool like prototype</font>

285
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,949
form we had everybody come up on the

286
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:31,930
stage at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say hey what here's</font>

287
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:33,610
what I worked on here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my next steps I</font>

288
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,810
have a github repository some people

289
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,880
already built a website and we're

290
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,140
hosting it live right now and it was a

291
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,420
really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to like close off the</font>

292
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:43,890
day and and show some give everybody

293
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,089
some recognition for they worked on<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font>

294
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,900
so just some closing thoughts here

295
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:50,620
though if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to replicate</font>

296
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:52,030
this outside outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> here one thing I</font>

297
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> works really well for us is that</font>

298
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were trying to keep it really</font>

299
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,490
informal in that we didn't want to

300
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">prescribe what people were working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on we</font>

301
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,910
had an idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a theme thrown out there</font>

302
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:03,280
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was more of an idea to get people</font>

303
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:06,790
started to think about some problem if

304
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">they weren't quite sure of something but</font>

305
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,120
it does have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be organized so we had</font>

306
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:12,040
an email address ahead of time that we

307
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:16,270
started talking to people with and we

308
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:19,089
kept some organization going but we kept

309
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,220
it loose<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on in an informal though</font>

310
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,840
which was pretty cool one other thing

311
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:24,649
that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works really nice is</font>

312
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,970
the idea that Brandon

313
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,559
brought up which is like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

314
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture hack thing and try to recruit</font>

315
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:32,180
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't do that at</font>

316
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook's own hackathons instead we</font>

317
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,689
have such big hack Khan's that people

318
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:37,249
post in like a group or so and try to

319
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:39,498
just recruit people like days in advance

320
00:11:37,249 --> 00:11:41,119
and usually you're just following post

321
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,529
on groups is kind of hard to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

322
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:45,819
engaged whereas this one you actually

323
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:48,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">had the whole like four to sell people</font>

324
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:50,118
and finally the only role of a hack on

325
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,420
is that you must hack so if you come to

326
00:11:50,119 --> 00:11:55,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hackathon try something try and hack</font>

327
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:07,429
hack with a group hack on your own but

328
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:09,079
just have fun thank you uh so we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

329
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:11,269
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit extra time so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

330
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:13,219
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to questions I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

331
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:16,429
question my name is a crystal calm with

332
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">wild cable and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I run a dev team doing</font>

333
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:20,629
software automation for the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

334
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:23,629
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to add that pair</font>

335
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:26,689
programming is integral part to our

336
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:29,420
process have developers all over the

337
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:33,259
country and so what we do is we use the

338
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,050
service called cloud 9i<font color="#CCCCCC"> o c9 dot io is</font>

339
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:37,850
the web URL and it's actually free and

340
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,920
when you sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> up an account they</font>

341
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:41,809
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> spin up a container like a</font>

342
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,079
docker container with an interpreter

343
00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:47,029
like PHP<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google golang or Python</font>

344
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,949
whatever is you want to use and actually

345
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use your web browser and you have a</font>

346
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:53,839
tab where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know you have your CLI</font>

347
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:56,059
your console with all the GNU utilities

348
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,230
you can see what each other are doing

349
00:12:56,059 --> 00:12:59,269
and then at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top you actually have</font>

350
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">your rich text editor for your for your</font>

351
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:04,519
code so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see what the other guy</font>

352
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:06,529
is typing in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top meanwhile you can</font>

353
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,299
be on the bottom tab actually you know

354
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:10,370
testing out the code on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the command line</font>

355
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:11,720
and you can share tabs and see what

356
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,610
other people are doing and you also have

357
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">the entire file structure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with all the</font>

358
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,490
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're working on and then</font>

359
00:13:15,319 --> 00:13:18,019
when you're done working on the

360
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,910
prototype hacking you actually just

361
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:22,519
export the code and drop it in your

362
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:24,649
source control so it's free they charge

363
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:26,089
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it and it's based on a web</font>

364
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:27,529
browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all you need you don't</font>

365
00:13:26,089 --> 00:13:29,360
need to have any of the development

366
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,639
tools installed so just figured I'd

367
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,100
share that with you guys cloud 9i oh

368
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,600
that's really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah because one of</font>

369
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,639
the problems we ran to when we first

370
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,780
tried it was how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> share and we</font>

371
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:40,890
originally

372
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,810
myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I re another guy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the team</font>

373
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:45,090
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> originally tried it just hovering</font>

374
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:46,589
over laptops and after a while that's

375
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:48,990
really uncomfortable so that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

376
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,370
cool idea people<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted our space they</font>

377
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:52,410
want to use their computers yeah

378
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,820
everybody gets to use their own computer

379
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:55,709
and it's free it's a doctor container

380
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,140
they give you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> one gig of ram and</font>

381
00:13:55,710 --> 00:14:00,120
one cpu and like you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple Giga</font>

382
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:05,250
space for each container and you can't

383
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,390
beat it really yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and also we we</font>

384
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:11,360
did we do have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the information</font>

385
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:13,920
online some of the slides from the

386
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,730
demonstrations of the the hacks have

387
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,589
links to their code we do have a github

388
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,500
repository off hackathon part of the

389
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nanak 67 webpage in a wiki it's not all</font>

390
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:30,540
complete but there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some information</font>

391
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:32,990
there yeah hacks thank you oh wait was

392
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:36,930
there another question hey sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

393
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:40,680
good I this is Brian Knight from night<font color="#CCCCCC"> L</font>

394
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:45,599
it's a participant of the hackathon so

395
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,280
you mentioned in there that people could

396
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,750
choose what hack they wanted to work on

397
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:54,150
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was particularly valuable</font>

398
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,640
it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font>

399
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:59,579
participants they're starting to carry

400
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,770
forward these projects I know my team we

401
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:04,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">are still talking about and we're still</font>

402
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,590
excited about the the pike on project so

403
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,740
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was one of the keys to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

404
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">success that's awesome and we also gave</font>

405
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,760
the team's a chance to ask for help so

406
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:17,190
part way through the day what are your

407
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,770
challenges is there any specific help

408

you need and so somebody needed

409

411
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:30,210
exchanges yeah it was really good having
