6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,440
cost of IXPs

7
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:44,230
all right just to open<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is my not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,559
new very old job I'm actually vice

9
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,390
president of global networks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix</font>

10
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need an applause that I</font>

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,570
just thought I should correct it that is

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,820
how i started the CDN a netflix however

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:04,210
so i'm here today to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everyone</font>

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:06,509
about IXPs and you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

15
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:09,910
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no peering track on the agenda</font>

16
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:11,259
this time around<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the program</font>

17
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,360
committee my understanding is that the

18
00:01:11,259 --> 00:01:15,100
program committee decided that they

19
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,020
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrate some of the peering</font>

20
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:19,690
content into the general<font color="#E5E5E5"> session I'm</font>

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,429
hopefully part of that but on top of

22
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:22,960
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to make sure that</font>

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,369
whatever we were putting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that track</font>

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
is fresh and I guess they just didn't

25
00:01:24,369 --> 00:01:30,600
feel that there was enough content to

26
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:34,030
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a track anyway this talk I'm here</font>

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a discussion I do want people to</font>

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,420
get up and ask questions I'll even

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,470
accept a thinly veiled comments in the

30
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">form of questions but what I am asking</font>

31
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:48,908
for is that you respect me you respect

32
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,939
the other people in the room you<font color="#E5E5E5"> respect</font>

33
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:54,159
the company's we're going to talk about

34
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,630
I'll be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little honest I'm personally a</font>

35
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,990
little rattled from the events over the

36
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,640
weekend and so I'm probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the same</font>

37
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,789
normal jovial self that you all know

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I of course em but I'll try to hold</font>

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:12,190
this together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll see where we can</font>

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:14,620
go so I XPS we know they're awesome

41
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:19,660
right we we know there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of them</font>

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:20,920
there's 771 acta or 454 actives 771

43
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,890
listed some of those are probably

44
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,170
aspirational some of those are defunct

45
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,059
whatever they might be you're not here

46
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">for a history lesson we can talk about</font>

47
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,170
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> offline if you really want to know</font>

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,170
more about the history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Iook speed but</font>

49
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:39,489
what I do want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure is that</font>

50
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:40,310
everyone knows<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I did gather as much</font>

51
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:44,239
data as I

52
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:45,920
from publicly available sources so I've

53
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,830
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marketing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> glossies from every</font>

54
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,170
ixp some of them are pretty boring some

55
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:54,200
of them are pretty entertaining there's

56
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:56,059
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of info and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of fluff I've</font>

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,799
read the annual reports of I excusa to

58
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:01,940
annual reports I read the budgets of

59
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,410
IXPs that that produce them I looked at

60
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the price lists historically i</font>

61
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:07,400
looked at 10 k's for<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies that need</font>

62
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,890
10 KS spent hours with archive.org

63
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,300
because that was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best sources</font>

64
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,779
there's no one really who maintains a

65
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,880
historical list of ixp pricing yope

66
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:18,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">snyder's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is working on something similar</font>

67
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,760
to that now and I link to that out of my

68
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,880
presentation so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that</font>

69
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">later on you can sort of grabbed water</font>

70
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:27,620
before I started but I can't guarantee

71
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,840
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred percent accurate</font>

72
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:34,069
because not all of his data is publicly

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,099
available what I can do is tell you that

74
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:39,859
I frame anything that I guess or infer

75
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:45,410
as just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I'm not going to state</font>

76
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:47,540
things as fact that aren't so we look at

77
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:51,170
the four IXPs that I used as my source

78
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:53,030
here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order you can see where it was</font>

79
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,089
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find info versus hard to find</font>

80
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:57,739
info I spoke with the board members of

81
00:03:56,090 --> 00:04:00,650
various IXPs I spoke with<font color="#E5E5E5"> current board</font>

82
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:02,329
members i spoke with export<font color="#E5E5E5"> members to</font>

83
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,730
be completely honest some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

84
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:06,680
stopped talking to me after they found

85
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:09,768
out what I was doing this for I can

86
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably tell you why I'm sure you can</font>

87
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:13,459
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on your own though and I</font>

88
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,799
actually found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to be super</font>

89
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,048
interesting because in some ways what I

90
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:20,450
saw were you know ad hominem attacks on

91
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:22,370
me for going even daring to ask

92
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions about this but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I also saw the</font>

93
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,240
other side of it which were people who

94
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:32,930
are genuinely interested in getting this

95
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:34,940
information out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was speaking</font>

96
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">with links links I had given</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

97
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,889
presentation a smaller version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

98
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,260

<font color="#E5E5E5">Diego now Los Angeles sorry a few months</font>

100
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,210
ago and links links board member got up

101
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:49,969
and corrected me and said this piece of

102
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,919
data is wrong that<font color="#CCCCCC"> board member was</font>

103
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,080
correct I had<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually under shot on the</font>

104
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,448
pricing

105
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,068
links sent me their historical pricing

106
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,580
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last five years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and a revised</font>

107
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:02,229
this presentation upwards based on that

108
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,550
we then got into a discussion about how

109
00:05:02,229 --> 00:05:05,409
they felt other pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

110
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,819
presentation might not be correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

111
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:08,169
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> great send me the detailed budget</font>

112
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:10,509
let me look at this and let me

113
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:13,030
understand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will gladly change my</font>

114
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:15,039
presentation if that's the case this is

115
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:16,688
the quote<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I got back so for various</font>

116
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,128
reasons such as not allowing our capex

117
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:20,020
budget to get exposed to vendors and

118
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:22,300
weaken or negotiating position this is

119
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,740
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a line item summary whether or not I</font>

120
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,960
could have gotten a more detailed

121
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,310
version under NDA I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

122
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:28,870
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point because I can't get</font>

123
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">up here and present</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you data that I</font>

124
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:36,610
received under NDA so another question

125
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,799
is when we talk about money what are we

126
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to dominate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this in right exchange</font>

127
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,270
rates fluctuate pretty regularly you

128
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,580
know the dollar versus the pound versus

129
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:47,198
the euro has changed a lot over the last

130
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,960
few years over the last decade

131
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,340
especially the currency conversion rates

132
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,438
are current there as of when this

133
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,960
presentation was put together the

134
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:59,229
reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if you're a company when this</font>

135
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,779
presentation is framed as a presentation

136
00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:03,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">given by a company in the u.s. trying to</font>

137
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:08,199
decide do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peer in Europe</font>

138
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:10,448
I'm pegged I'm stuck with the currency

139
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:12,099
conversion<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not a bank I can't</font>

140
00:06:10,449 --> 00:06:13,839
you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any benefits that</font>

141
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:17,909
someone else doesn't get so this is

142
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,909
reality this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> cash flow out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of pocket</font>

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:31,199
so i have another quote that i'd like to

regulate ourselves for a much more

profits and drinking and social events

153
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,960
rather than the reducing price and

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's certainly their option in fact</font>

155
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,140
one might even call it a smart use of

156
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,180
the funds given a rational assessment of

157
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,590
the primary customer base a bunch of

158
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,120
small networks who don't and will

probably never realize the economics

business model thank you Richard so

171
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:38,230
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about the ixp</font>

172
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:40,570
corporation types there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonprofits</font>

00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,580
we're talking about ixp corporation

179
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:57,280
we'll get to in a moment there are

180
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,340
for-profit ones and in some cases you

181
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,219
have a non-profit owned by a for-profit

182
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,989
where there is one share issued of the

183
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:07,450
nonprofit which is owned by the

185
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,409
one of these organizations would like to

work sure my company pays for me to be

195
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,039
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's great but companies also</font>

twenty-two thousand dollars per years

00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:45,070
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 15,000 British pounds I think</font>

199
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,650
it's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good hourly rate for board</font>

200
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:48,410
meetings the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chair is compensated 44,000</font>

201
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,930
but that's actually

202
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:52,310
professional full-time job<font color="#CCCCCC"> am-6 if</font>

203
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,258
you've removed appreciation from the

204
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,029
budget which is a fun little accounting

205
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:57,740
thing that all of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to deal with</font>

206
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,410
anyone here who runs a network knows

207
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,870
what depreciation is turn 4.1 million

208
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,370
cash in 2015 but once you add

209
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:10,459
depreciation and it actually looks like

210
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:13,699
negative cash flow so when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

211
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:14,839
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> models of these IXPs and what</font>

212
00:09:13,699 --> 00:09:16,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">people think they are and what they</font>

213
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:19,160
actually are the member model what is it

214
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:22,879
right i'm a member my company is a

215
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,370
member of links many of you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room</font>

216
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,589
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of your members of am-6 and</font>

217
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,860
other IXPs that consider themselves

218
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,810
membership-based IXPs they're not you

219
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:34,220
when you vote for something though that

220
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,829
vote is non-binding at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

221
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,720
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> even the board is an advisory board</font>

222
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:41,870
it's a professionally managed company

223
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,730
that can choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do things or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not they</font>

224
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">can choose to adjust pricing whether or</font>

225
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:47,389
not their members give them permission

226
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:49,519
to do so so at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day that</font>

227
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:51,410
is not a member run organization it is

228
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the same way that we elect people to</font>

229
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,639
you know represent us here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the states</font>

230
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,500
to the government they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose</font>

231
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,790
what the tax rate is just because I pay

232
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:02,029
taxes doesn't mean that I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to choose</font>

233
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:03,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that tax rate is in some cases as I</font>

234
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:05,779
mentioned here the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself is</font>

235
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:07,790
non-binding itself it's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> advisor to</font>

236
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corporation and some of that is</font>

00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:12,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">covered in bylaws some of that is just</font>

238
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,670
informal sometime is formal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would ask</font>

239
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,529
at that point is membership<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

240
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:23,410
membership better do we really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

241
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:23,410
that having this as such a soft kind of

242
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:28,189
engagement where you make a vote board

243
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,680
doesn't necessarily have to honor that

244
00:10:28,189 --> 00:10:35,899
vote is that really what we think we're

245
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:39,199
getting so when we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> member though</font>

246
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:41,360
are we really thinking 501<font color="#E5E5E5"> C 12 in the</font>

247
00:10:39,199 --> 00:10:45,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">state's here right a co-op are we</font>

248
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:47,449
thinking hey if I am giving you money

249
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are using that money to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me a</font>

250
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:51,979
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that service in this case</font>

251
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,019
would be interconnection I give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

252
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:56,480
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> you give me a switch port I can</font>

00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:58,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">put traffic on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that switch port everyone</font>

254
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,500
is happy if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give you too much money</font>

255
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,569
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can either directly reinvest that in</font>

256
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,980
giving me a better switch port or you

257
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,430
can give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money back at the end</font>

258
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:11,340
of the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you look at the IRS</font>

259
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,870
definition here you know it's pretty

260
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,310
straightforward right they collected

261
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,080
eighty-five percent of their income from

262
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:19,380
members for the sole purpose of meeting

263
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,750
losses and expenses of operating that

264
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,610
co-op this is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many utilities work</font>

265
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:25,380
this is how telephone companies work

266
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,470
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a whole statewide telephone</font>

267
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,990
company coops there are lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> and lots of</font>

268
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,840
electrical coops this is how utilities

269
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:38,100
are delivered in many cases both here

270
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:40,380
and abroad so let's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue about</font>

271
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,970
whether translators peering is is better

272
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,410
than hearing because obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> Transit</font>

273
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,940
is the better deal here and let's talk

274
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:50,010
about why so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to frame this</font>

275
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,900
slide and say that net<font color="#E5E5E5"> node did reduce</font>

276
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:53,460
their prices they reduced their prices a

277
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,590
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first time I</font>

279
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:58,110
whether you want to call it cause or

00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:59,760
effect or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help call it a</font>

281
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:01,230
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> coincidence I don't really care</font>

282

00:13:40,429 --> 00:13:45,619
know you level out at about twenty cents

323
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:47,509
and yeah it's not not too bad you know

324
00:13:45,619 --> 00:13:55,669
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about a 30-cent average</font>

325
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:56,689
across these major IXPs so what you do

326
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:58,339
have to remember though is even though

327
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:59,689
you're paying thirty cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Meg you</font>

don't get the benefit of just dropping

<font color="#E5E5E5">because every networks different but the</font>

341
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:30,618
reality is is if we just look at on a

342
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:33,529
percentage basis it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> way too high so</font>

343
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:35,689
if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at the trends transit has</font>

344
00:14:33,529 --> 00:14:37,100
continued to outpace ixp ports for the

345
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:39,349
last five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

346
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,359
pretty obvious here you see that curve

347
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,809
you see the major correction between

348
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:47,119
2012 and 2013 and you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> more gradual</font>

349
00:14:44,809 --> 00:14:49,279
curve from 2013 on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not really</font>

350
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:52,249
seeing none of those lines really<font color="#E5E5E5"> track</font>

351
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,169
the transit line right which is what we

352
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:56,089
stand here and compare and we can talk

353
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:58,129
about quality of transit versus peering

354
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,629
that's a whole we could spend another<font color="#E5E5E5"> 45</font>

355
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:01,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> presentation arguing about that</font>

356
00:14:59,629 --> 00:15:05,689
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done that enough times</font>

357
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:08,059
already in this forum so why how did we

358
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:09,769
get here is it the underlying cost is it

359
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:11,988
that the hardware is just ridiculously

360
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:14,419
expensive and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just no way that</font>

361
00:15:11,989 --> 00:15:16,369
there's any way that we could reduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

362
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:19,579
underlying<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to these services no</font>

363
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:23,329
right if you look at a switch capable of

364
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:27,199
operating an IXP you have you know 90

365
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:28,529
some percent reduction you over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

366
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,748
five<font color="#CCCCCC"> years for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that 10</font>

367
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,610
Kourt you look at the cost of transit

368
00:15:30,749 --> 00:15:34,319
that's actually tracked it way closer

369
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,959
right you have almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eighty percent</font>

370
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:42,569
reduction but the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> IXPs are nowhere</font>

371
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:44,758
even close to that if you also look at

372
00:15:42,569 --> 00:15:49,290
revenue versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> investment so again</font>

373
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,970
coming back to the hardware argument if

374
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,009
you look at revenue revenue continues to

375
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,559
grow this is from am sixes annual report

376
00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:57,360
you see that up into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right everyone</font>

377
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,309
here who<font color="#CCCCCC"> likes looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at graphs of</font>

378
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,230
things whatever those might be generally

379
00:15:59,309 --> 00:16:03,689
up into the right is good and you know

380
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,790
down is bad but if you look at

381
00:16:03,689 --> 00:16:08,040
investment the investment<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty</font>

382
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,410
lumpy<font color="#CCCCCC"> there right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you go up you know</font>

383
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:13,349
increasing investment with revenue into

384
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:16,139
2013 and 2014 you see that huge jump and

385
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:17,430
then 2015 next to nothing yet all we get

386
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,649
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a five percent price</font>

387
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:26,128
reduction for 2017 so I asked the

<font color="#E5E5E5">question of gpf why wouldn't I XP start</font>

411
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:17,730
that it's reliable it's as cheap as it

412
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,409
can get and it's scaled quite well as

415
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:29,010
think they yeah so but I XPS you're

416
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,689
still seeing them go put lots and lots

417
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:32,700
and lots of money into big expensive

418
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:34,020
routers when really they could run just

419
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,149
fine on switches and we'll talk about

420
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,389
the feature set that's needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font>

421
00:17:36,149 --> 00:17:41,850
in a second but not needed and when I

422
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,570
asked the question of gpf it was very

423
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,000
much so the

424
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:47,220
came back as sunk cost fallacy right oh

425
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,029
we've invested all this time and all of

426
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:53,220
this engineering into how how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

427
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:54,750
this awesome brocade or juniper or

428
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,580
whatever platform work we could never

429
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:59,299
possibly undo that investment why would

430
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:02,250
we walk away from that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ridiculous</font>

431
00:17:59,299 --> 00:18:04,950
again happy to talk about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

432
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:07,950
that the failure to innovate hear that

433
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,779
channeling money towards marketing and

434
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,850
not towards engineering is one of the

435
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:14,190
problems here and an over engineered

436
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,658
products we I were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just asking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Furley to</font>

437
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:17,639
layer to fabric why are we not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

438
00:18:15,659 --> 00:18:20,070
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a layer to fabric is to blame</font>

439
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:22,830
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would take certainly a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 50-percent</font>

440
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:24,779
price cut to get fat reduction in

441
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,189
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to what is a</font>

442
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:27,389
good old hearing switch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

443
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:33,230
most of the other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this room</font>

444
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:38,879
would agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same so there we go</font>

445
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:42,120
if we look at the correlation right so

446
00:18:38,879 --> 00:18:44,490
of ethernet switching costs against

447
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,018
again I XP pricing there was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

448
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,759
year where you even see any kind of

449
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:49,559
correlation between hey these ports got

450
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,139
cheaper for us to add and the port

451
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,269
pricing got cheaper aside from that you

452
00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:56,490
see some you know pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> big nose dives</font>

453
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:57,570
there you see not really a lot of

454
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,950
changes based on the underlying

455
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,860
infrastructure and when you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

456
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:05,279
what an IXP is an IXP is basically just

457
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:09,389
underlying infrastructure so no real

458
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:11,669
answer on that one either you would

459
00:19:09,389 --> 00:19:13,379
think though that adding scale would get

460
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:17,129
our pricing down right we would see

461
00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:18,330
great advantages to you know again those

462
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:20,100
of you have been to the peering track

463
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:22,918
remember when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IXPs used to love to</font>

464
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">get up and say hey up into the right</font>

465
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,730
look at this awesome graph if you've

466
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,860
never seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nick Hill yrs presentation</font>

467
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:30,779
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just all about up into the right</font>

468
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">I highly suggest you watch it because it</font>

469
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:35,220
will sum every I excuse presentation for

470
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last decade which is basically hey</font>

471
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,940
traffic continues to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow we're awesome</font>

472
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">and great traffic does continue to grow</font>

473
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,950
and I XPS are awesome but why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we not</font>

474
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:45,659
getting any actual scale advantage from

475
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:47,070
that where is that advantage being a

476
00:19:45,659 --> 00:19:50,120
crude because it doesn't seem like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

477
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,120
being your crew by the members

478
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:58,320
if they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not decreasing right if we</font>

479
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,210
think about a customer of scale

480
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,879
somebody's got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 ports 20 ports 30</font>

481
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:04,740
ports why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not seeing why are we</font>

482
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">not publishing pricing that gets you</font>

483
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,070
better price it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets you a better deal</font>

484
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,410
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy ten twenty thirty what</font>

485
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:12,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">however many ports it might be the only</font>

486
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,460
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who really see any benefit are</font>

487
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,620
you know certain IXPs give away one gig

488
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:18,630
ports to small customers but the guys

489
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:20,669
who are sustaining this who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> growing</font>

490
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:23,190
these IXPs are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing any advantage</font>

491
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,110
the one dirty little secret that I'll

492
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know is the the used</font>

493
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:28,979
car dealer analogy they don't want you

494
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,169
to know is that most of the pricing with

495
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,030
IXPs is negotiable at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

496
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:34,680
they're not you know the members don't

497
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:36,270
have to vote<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what the pricing is and</font>

498
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,710
so you certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get yourself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

499
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:43,920
pricing if you want it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

500
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:47,040
well known so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about why I</font>

501
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:50,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my hypothesis why we</font>

502
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,460
haven't seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> any real innovation in this</font>

503
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:55,800
space so first of all technology we just

504
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,350
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with extended you know</font>

505
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:00,230
with with extended scale comes extended

506
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,850
staff so we've got support staff

507
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,460
supporting these extended marketing an

508
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:07,199
international expansion so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we talk</font>

509
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,780
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment again if you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

510
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,940
some giant brocade box now neatly fits

511
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,399
in that like little Cisco box right

512
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,380
Porter<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power quarter of the space</font>

513
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,810
quarter of the price way better density

514
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:22,290
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to focus on</font>

515
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:25,500
quarter of the price in this case mr.

516
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hargrove or mr. mr. levy or mr. hargrave</font>

517
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,660
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike on hello</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hargrave</font>

518
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:35,430
from Alana I'm not Martin and I noticed

519
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:38,640
you've only got one box here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice</font>

520
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said once which one device the thing</font>

521
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,310
is is even a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mid-sized ixp like Lana has</font>

522
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,900
tens of boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a group we spend a lot of</font>

523
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:47,550
money<font color="#CCCCCC"> on them these are multiple sites</font>

524
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,560
part of our mission is to keep data

525
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:51,720
center operators honest we're operating

526
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,220
in multiple data centers and all of that

527
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-site infrastructure costs a lot of</font>

528
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,570
money yeah but it in reduct in return

529
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,240
for that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get you guys get much</font>

530
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:03,450
better pricing on racks cross connects

531
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,500
power so I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the point I</font>

532
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,270
want to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> this into site</font>

533
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,280
infrastructure

534
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:09,290
cost a little money I'm not I'm not sure

535
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,930
that I follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the latter point on that</font>

536
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:15,110
but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand that i think the meta</font>

537
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:17,210
point which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree I'm simplifying</font>

538
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,610
this we could talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

539
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">six has a few extensions right they've</font>

540
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:24,709
got three or four switches around around

541
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:26,960
the the Seattle area loan app has a

542
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">dozen switches right links has probably</font>

543
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,160
two dozen switches certainly there is

544
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,690
scaled<font color="#E5E5E5"> cams like says hundreds dot five</font>

545
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,970
is all around I'm Saddam<font color="#E5E5E5"> sister on his</font>

546
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,950
infrastructure on absolutely and I think

547
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,200
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is expensive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in total</font>

548
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:40,910
agreement but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

549
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,170
I make from that is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as that grows</font>

550
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:43,850
in the same way that I go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and buy</font>

551
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:46,250
dark fiber the more dark fiber i buy the

552
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:49,070
cheaper it gets I wish that was the case

553
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:52,240
in London<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks well London's dark</font>

554
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,240
fiber is already pretty darn cheap

555
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:59,149
ticket you coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> and going that's also</font>

556
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:05,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing flying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into Heathrow so</font>

557
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:09,800
oh sorry I respectfully disagree that I

558
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:12,020
XPS is part I'm sorry identifier sorry

559
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,470
Dan Goldin with Google I respectfully

560
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:16,910
disagree that I XPS a part of their role

561
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:18,320
in distributing their infrastructure to

562
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,300
somehow keep data center providers

563
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,679
honest yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even know what that</font>

564
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">means and it certainly doesn't control</font>

565
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:27,350
prices in fact you know all it does is

566
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:29,870
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to reach customers which</font>

567
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:32,750
is great which is wonderful but there's

568
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,399
no check on you know data center pricing

569
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,950
or power or anything like that it's it's

570
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,150
immaterial<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right I'll let mr.</font>

571
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,350
Hargrove answer that because I think

572
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was the point that I struggle to</font>

573
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,580
follow as well yeah well the key thing

574
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,380
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember when Netflix built to</font>

575
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,870
London when you first<font color="#E5E5E5"> launched in the UK</font>

576
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and EU we had a conversation I say all</font>

577
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:51,709
you can go to this date center operator

578
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,810
this one but whichever one you go to you

579
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:55,690
can still reach a good selection of IXPs

580
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,159
and a good selection of private peers if

581
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,110
that were not the case then you would

582
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">have had to build into the one choice</font>

583
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:05,929
sure and and that's the point I'm making

584
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:08,810
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and i agree with you i</font>

585
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:11,900
would say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could we could all</font>

586
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:15,080
agree that the fact that we have IXPs in

587
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:16,520
various markets that allow you to get it

588
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:18,269
get to that I XP for multiple different

589
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,559
data centers you know I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

590
00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:21,929
full disclosure on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chair of the</font>

591
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:24,389
board for community IX which has FL IX

592
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:25,979
in Florida we the reason why we're

593
00:24:24,389 --> 00:24:27,629
successful is because we're in three

594
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:29,999
different major colocation facilities if

595
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:31,918
we were just<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one well arguably given</font>

596
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:33,749
the market that exists there we<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

597
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:35,849
still would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> successful just based on</font>

598
00:24:33,749 --> 00:24:39,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pricing structure but regardless of</font>

599
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:41,189
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree that is absolutely a must</font>

600
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,369
have when people go to move into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a data</font>

601
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:46,139
center they are looking usually for hey

602
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:47,668
if the major I XP in this market is

603
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:48,748
links or loan app I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

604
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:50,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're in this data center</font>

605
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:52,859
absolutely important and that does

606
00:24:50,729 --> 00:24:55,079
create a burden on both the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

607
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,359
and the I XP and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could talk</font>

608
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:59,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the fact that there are many data</font>

609
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,978
centers that have given<font color="#CCCCCC"> away space and</font>

610
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:03,629
power and infrastructure to IXPs because

611
00:25:01,979 --> 00:25:05,489
they realize in order to get people in

612
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:09,059
the door they do that and so that that

613
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:11,339
discussion cuts both ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's move</font>

614
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:15,178
on we can certainly bring that back up

615
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:18,809
in Q&A piano if we have time so next

616
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:20,249
hypothesis<font color="#E5E5E5"> headcount so I really wanted</font>

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,089
other small companies that late a bunch

you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the executive management</font>

00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:36,928
and cogent know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're frugal and</font>

624
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:38,759
so you know that they'll hire when they

628
00:25:42,329 --> 00:25:46,950
really interesting counterpoint to ixp

629
00:25:45,149 --> 00:25:49,978
staffing and just the general trends

630
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:51,839
which is that cojen which operates a

631
00:25:49,979 --> 00:25:54,389
network in you know dozens of countries

632
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:57,299
at this point has continued<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add</font>

633
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:59,519
headcount right there at almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 X</font>

634
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:04,769
what they're more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 10 X sorry what</font>

635
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:07,379
the largest I XP is but<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they've</font>

636
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:10,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">really grown pretty much on the same</font>

637
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:12,119
pattern as the other IXPs unfortunately

638
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:15,059
this data was incomplete it was hard to

639
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:18,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">find ate it before 2013 on what any of</font>

640
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:21,418
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs other than net node looked like</font>

641
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:24,239
our sorry am-6 looked like but you can

642
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:26,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">see it's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much the same trend but</font>

643
00:26:24,239 --> 00:26:28,950
cojen has added countries and metros and

644
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:31,740
has five<font color="#E5E5E5"> are all over the world and so</font>

645
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:35,520
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth most of these IXPs have</font>

646
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:37,710
you know 10 20 30 switches in a metro

647
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,059
and that's it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it most they've added</font>

648
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:41,100
a couple data centers here and there if

649
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:42,540
you have to add<font color="#E5E5E5"> one staff every time you</font>

650
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">one head count every time you got a data</font>

center you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not taking</font>

652
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:49,379
advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the scale that you should</font>

653
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,660
be if I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add staff every time we</font>

654
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:53,040
opened up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new pop my team would be you</font>

655
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:58,770
know in numbering in the hundreds at

656
00:26:53,040 --> 00:27:01,409
this point so let's talk a little bit

657
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,780
about marketing you paid on average

658
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,970
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 450 bucks to sit here and watch me</font>

659
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,399
speak I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally consider that a</font>

660
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,360
bargain I accept free drinks afterwards

661
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,150
if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make up the difference</font>

662
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,500
I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you any cat pictures so I</font>

663
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:17,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a little bit of</font>

664
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:20,460
kudos for that there's almost a thousand

665
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:22,439
people here<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually roughly 900 so 450</font>

666
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,420
thousand or so given you know high and

667
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,410
low water mark and registrations total

668
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,510
event budgets about four hundred

669
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:30,210
thousand dollars so there's fifty

670
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:32,910
thousand dollars in profit just from

671
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:34,410
registrations give or<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then you add</font>

672
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:37,650
in all the sponsorships on top of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

673
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:39,360
all of that money<font color="#CCCCCC"> just goes you know we</font>

677
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,710
about again tomorrow morning at the

money and we put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into education which</font>

680

will hear about next we're going to

00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:53,970
outreach you'll also hear about that

682
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,760
staff salaries we have a very lean staff

00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:59,280
right Steph travel we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

686
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:06,090
the inevitable downturn Microsoft's

buying linkedin today for 26.2 billion

688
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:11,639
dollars we're placing bets as to whether

689
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:13,559
that is the sign of the start of this or

690
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,270
if that is the sign that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep going I'm hoping it's the</font>

692
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:23,010
latter but if you look at what these

693
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,990
organizations are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing with their money</font>

they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these events right and</font>

695
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:29,160
this is certainly not an exhausting it

00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,600
is not an exhaustive list just an

699
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,150
organizations I actually saw a couple of

700
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,040
new ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was going to add to this</font>

701
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,110
slide and decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was</font>

702
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,610
representative enough but you're paying

00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">for staff at these things you're paying</font>

704
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,820
for sponsorships you're paying to get

705

your logo on things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's non</font>

true

707
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:53,100
you'll amount of money and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

708
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,620
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what the focus</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

709
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:57,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations are there you know they're</font>

710
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">just some of them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just like that odd</font>

711
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,629
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those events</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are like</font>

712
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,520
nanog it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for someone to show</font>

713
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:04,950
up and give some money and help out that

714
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:08,070
community but there are way you know

715
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:09,870
less altruistic reasons than that if you

716
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:13,139
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about commercial meeting operators</font>

717
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,929
ITW you know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a nod nanog it</font>

718
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,160
is a multi-million if not billion dollar

719
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,170
event at this point if you look at the

720
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Commerce that that is funneled</font>

721
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:24,570
through that event you have marketing

722
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,370
you have paid award ceremonies if none

723
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:28,379
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are familiar with this next time</font>

724
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,239
someone gets an awesome award look at

725
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,620
and find out how to get nominated for

726
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,860
that award and see where you send the

727
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:38,250
check and then you have galas and social

728
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,919
events I did not get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to ripe that</font>

729
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:44,910
looked awesome but if I look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

730
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:46,320
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that second bar there as</font>

731
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:50,040
far as what net node has done over the

732
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,750
last five years come on really so this

733
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,460
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're at we're at a point where</font>

734
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:55,770
prices haven't been reduced in five

735
00:29:53,460 --> 00:30:04,950
years yet this dance routine looked

736
00:29:55,770 --> 00:30:11,670
phenomenal so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all right mister</font>

737
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:16,740
mister much at hi Dave jared montz from

738
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:20,220
ntg wow there's an echo in here um the

739
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:22,260
net nod dinner was excellent but you

740
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,930
also had to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to it it wasn't</font>

741
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,360
free it doesn't cover itself it doesn't

742
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:30,000
cover itself and nor do a lot of the

743
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,179
events here that you that you come to

744
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,110
enjoy like beer and gear and the other

745
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,670
thing said you have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to solicit</font>

746
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:41,669
sponsors for for these types of events

747
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,500
yep so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not defending net nod but I'm</font>

748
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:46,669
saying it definitely was an excellent

749
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:51,200
dinner and you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

750
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:53,029
I will remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for next time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

751
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,919
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely right so that was the</font>

752
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:57,470
point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide regarding nanog</font>

753
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,869
finances things like you're in gear are

754
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,269
paid<font color="#CCCCCC"> for through sponsorships right we</font>

755
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:04,668
can't cover the cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting just</font>

756
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:06,470
based purely on registration and most of

757
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:08,119
the sponsors who show up there show up

758
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:10,369
because they know they get to sell to a

759
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,439
room of awesome people who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

760
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:14,149
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy things and so that's why</font>

761
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,830
they're here but we've made a huge

762
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:17,779
effort to keep that out of the room in

763
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:19,668
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same way that the socials at nanog</font>

764
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:21,499
are also sponsored by people but you

765
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:23,269
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what i would much rather see you</font>

766
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:24,799
know thanks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our host edge connects a</font>

767
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:27,919
for-profit company that can make

768
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">decisions about how they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

769
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,919
allocate their money and decide that hey

770
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,950
in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> market where I have competition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

771
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,889
need to focus on reducing my prices not

772
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:41,450
on throwing awesome social events and at

773
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:43,070
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day there's an accountant</font>

774
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,279
and there's some sliders and they decide

775
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:52,908
here's how we spend money and to me this

776
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:55,039
seems egregious so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one point</font>

777
00:31:52,909 --> 00:31:57,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">where there was disagreement but because</font>

778
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,169
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marty budgets are not broken out in</font>

779
00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:05,269
detail I had no way of actually going

780
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:08,509
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really correlating this aside</font>

781
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:09,919
from much broader line items and you're

782
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,389
all welcome this all came from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

783
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,249
publicly available budgets where they

784
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:17,959
cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in pretty broad brush terms but</font>

785
00:32:16,249 --> 00:32:19,369
from what I was able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find we'll talk</font>

786
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,419
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know these budgets are</font>

787
00:32:19,369 --> 00:32:23,178
somewhere in the neighborhood of a

788
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:25,909
million dollars if we think about links

789
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:28,940
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 62 ports or 7.3 percent of</font>

790
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:30,619
applicable revenue am-6 that's 76 ports

791
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,659
or eight point three percent of

792
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:34,220
applicable revenue that's real money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

793
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,559
I would much rather have an eight point

794
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:40,879
three percent discount then have you

795
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:45,489
know coffee and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

796
00:32:40,879 --> 00:32:50,029
that who had an espresso this morning

797
00:32:45,489 --> 00:32:52,039
pretty tasty right I was proud as

798
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:53,690
Netflix to sponsor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

799
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,940
happily do that again<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't find</font>

800
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,289
sponsors to continue doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but at</font>

801
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,330
the end of the day I would much rather

802
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:01,310
am-6 have held<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to the three</font>

803
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:03,770
revenue and given me a discount of three

804
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:06,830
percent of my boards right so that was

805
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:09,170
27 10 gig ports that just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

806
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:12,460
revenue that just got drank away and

807
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,460
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get peed out in the bathroom later</font>

808
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:21,020
so I look at an IXP is utility it's a

809
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:24,140
necessary utility I want IXPs I think I

810
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:25,700
excuse are awesome however utilities who

811
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,590
don't have competition usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> due to</font>

812
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:29,470
regulation depending on who the utility

813
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:31,520
is you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

814
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:33,080
competition in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the power space you don't</font>

815
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">see a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of competition in the telecom</font>

816
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,610
space but they don't spend a lot of

817
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">money on sales and marketing you'll see</font>

818
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,600
from time to time outreach programs and

819
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:44,450
things like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't see you</font>

820
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,270
know PG&E or whoever the electric

821
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,070
company is here out paying for coffee

822
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:51,080
bars right that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do with</font>

823
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,790
their money although the for-profit ones

824
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:55,159
certainly can and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again they make that</font>

825
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:58,550
decision but if you're regulated with a

826
00:33:55,160 --> 00:34:00,410
rate card you have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice of hey I'm</font>

827
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:02,870
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get X amount of dollars in this</font>

828
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:05,330
year I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> only spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know</font>

829
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,429
however I can but I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a loss</font>

830
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:10,159
right I can only decide that I want to

831
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:12,409
apply the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money that I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taking in to</font>

832
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,089
whatever marketing programs i have or<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

833
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:16,069
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> development programs i have or</font>

834
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:19,550
to salary or whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be but</font>

835
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:21,230
that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're fixed the competition</font>

836
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:23,510
of the ixp space has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been created by the</font>

837
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:25,820
I excuse themselves in some cases it's

838
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,760
been great it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked out quite well in</font>

839
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,750
many other cases it's been a flop and

840
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">depending on how you define a flop in</font>

841
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:33,199
some cases you're talking about it's

842
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:34,520
flopped in one year or sometimes if you

843
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,649
look at I squeeze around for three or

844
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,449
five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if you know a lonely I</font>

845
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,880
switching the closet does not make an

846
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:43,210
IXP with you know three or four members

847
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,220
that you would consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a flop</font>

848
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:47,810
members<font color="#E5E5E5"> though have invested in those</font>

849
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:49,609
and but they don't get the choice as to

850
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:52,699
whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> continue paying for</font>

851
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:54,590
them in my opinion just like a co-op

852
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:56,239
members should have visibility into the

853
00:34:54,590 --> 00:35:01,430
return on investment on those sorts of

854
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:03,529
activities so like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier why</font>

855
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,200
can't they all be like the six please be

856
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:08,330
like the sex I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see the six out</font>

857
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:10,339
sponsoring lots of things I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

858
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:11,779
put their name on in-kind sponsorships

859
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,660
for things and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I love</font>

860
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing that</font>

861
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">seeing the community support itself 220</font>

862
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:22,650
members that's huge no recurring fees no

863
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:24,930
coffee bars otherwise we're left with

864
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:30,720
this which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:32,819

operational IXPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should say and you</font>

868
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:38,700
know whether they've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> successful or</font>

869
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:41,220
not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> members haven't had a choice as</font>

870
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">to whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not it's their money that</font>

871
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,490
goes to fund these projects or that

872
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,799
money gets put back in their pockets<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

873
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,209
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were really in a coop model then</font>

874
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:50,130
that money would have gone directly back

875
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:52,109
into the members pockets because while

876
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:54,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">co-ops do not forbid geographic</font>

877
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:58,920
expansion they certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't encourage</font>

878
00:35:54,089 --> 00:36:00,420
it so is there an expectation of

879
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,069
domestic member of an IXP that their

880

884
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:13,279
underwrite that project well which could

885
00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:16,020
eventually develop into something sure

886
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,789
from a profitability perspective or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

888
00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:20,339
you my answer which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want that money</font>

889
00:36:19,049 --> 00:36:23,940
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pocket I'm sure there are</font>

891
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,130
that money then just be returned back to

892
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:31,740
the members right who's held accountable

893
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:34,079
if you do pull the plug on an IXP right

894
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,500
that money is my money is your money and

895
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,640
yet it's gone why is there no

896
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:44,099
accountability from membership

897
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,569
perspective there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are markets that I XPS</font>

Amsterdam there's places in the US where

901
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:53,250
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done is an IXP just encouraging</font>

902
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:55,440
people to get people off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fabric</font>

903
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,700
and really is that where they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

904
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,109
focusing their efforts or should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

905
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,419
focusing their efforts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on making the</font>

907
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:03,539
do lobbying there are companies like

Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support will spend billions</font>

make a difference or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that money</font>

911
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:13,160

<font color="#CCCCCC">than lobbying</font>

913

skipped a slide no we didn't sorry so my

00:37:23,269 --> 00:37:27,379
conclusions on this I XPS have not

916
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:29,359
followed industry trends for

917
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,160
consolidation would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be crazy to think</font>

918
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,348
that maybe we only need a couple of

00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,779
major ixp operators two three four of

920
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:38,900
them or do we really need 40 or 50 of

00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:47,650
deliver us a layer to switching fabric

not lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> and lots of bells and whistles</font>

926
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,140
there's an open question as to whether

927
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:53,869
or not members should have more say in

928
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:57,170
how money is spent is how their<font color="#E5E5E5"> money is</font>

930
00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:00,769
was a controversial point that I asked

gpf some people agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it some</font>

1001
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,150
which I find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little disturbing but the</font>

1002
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:09,410
answer is yes we actually measure how

1003
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:13,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">many members we get when we go to</font>

00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:17,630
it didn't pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for itself we wouldn't be</font>

1006
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,250
doing it and those people are not

00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:20,360
showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to links because it's useful</font>

1008
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,740
they're showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because we went there</font>

1009
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,060
and said oh by the way did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font>

1010
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,580
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> London you can get this many peers</font>

1011
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,920
and they went oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> really so the answer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1012
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,810
yes it is useful maybe the coffee bar

1013
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,670
nanog is not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest place nothing</font>

1014
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">personal you know because everybody here</font>

1017
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,660
roi that was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> my answer the question</font>

1018
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:43,190
are we to answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i would i would say</font>

1024
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,700
you hit the nail right on the head which

1025
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:58,160
is that that net node thing is not

1026

making you mentioned utilities being

1035

1036
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,130
new from marketing is your opinion that

1037
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,049
potentially regulating IXPs or appearing

1038
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:28,220
would reduce the amount of unnecessary

1039
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:30,110
marketing that is the most catch-22

1040

1089
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:47,319
that's fine so I'm wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you're</font>

banging on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so look I think your point is</font>

taken your<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is absolutely taken and</font>

1092
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:59,410
just again you whitewash the fact on

1093
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:00,640
membership again which is that the vote

1094
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:03,190
is not binding whether or not there is

1095
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,499
an issue the vote is not binding so it

1096
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:07,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">is what it is let me finish please I was</font>

like to just make the point my point you

1099
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:16,809
make great points but Christian Koch who

1100
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:18,400
is not here yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> who I actually would</font>

00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:20,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> liked to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have made his point again</font>

from Betty<font color="#E5E5E5"> made of gpf made an excellent</font>

1103
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,549
point which is that when we think about

1104
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who go out and write checks</font>

00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally not the same people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font>

1107
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:33,430
in larger networks who are the ones who

1108
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:35,589
make excellent technical decisions about

1109
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:37,299
how to build those networks a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1110
00:45:35,589 --> 00:45:39,009
time those two functions are separated

1111
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:41,049
but unfortunately in the way that most

1112
00:45:39,009 --> 00:45:42,489
of these membership IXPs function the

1113
00:45:41,049 --> 00:45:43,690
technical people are the one making<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

votes they're not the ones looking at

00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:50,170
the dollars and cents or pounds and of

1116
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:51,789
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens and they may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1118
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:57,249
you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get based on scale an</font>

1119
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,779
equivalent vote so if I've got 50<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports</font>

much than a one gig member that one gig

1128
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,779
blatantly do what your slide talks about

1129
00:46:20,589 --> 00:46:24,609
and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn around to the room</font>

1130
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:26,729
here and I'm actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pitch</font>

1131
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:29,979
this out to everybody else out here I

1132
00:46:26,729 --> 00:46:32,200
love the six many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1133
00:46:29,979 --> 00:46:34,359
different job role I helped to donate

1134
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,749
some hardware to get the 6 up and going

1135
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:40,509
it's a model i absolutely love rather

1136
00:46:37,749 --> 00:46:43,180
than necessarily say we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to champion</font>

1137
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:45,460
fixing the existing IXPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will say if</font>

1138
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,219
there are locations and places out there

1139
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:51,700
where entities want to create six like

1140
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:54,069
peering fabrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will show up at them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1141
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">will support them these are a wonderful</font>

1142
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:56,190
one

1143
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:59,670
thing we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't necessarily need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1144
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:01,290
existing IXPs fix your broken models we

1145
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,050
can take the six and say you know what

1146
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:06,450
that's a model we like let's do more of

1147
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:11,070
it everywhere absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

1148
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:12,810
agree and I think we've seen that we see

1149
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:17,670
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> and more of that in various other</font>

1150
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:19,140
markets<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would argue i would hope that</font>

1151
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:21,420
people in the room are not going to

1152
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,370
fixate on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the specific numbers and more</font>

1153
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,810
on the meta point the net node thing is

1154
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,900
a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> example look I could have picked</font>

1155
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,340
any number you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm Facebook friends</font>

1156
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,990
with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in this room I</font>

1157
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:33,150
could pick any number of different

1158
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:35,279
things any number of dinners any number

1159
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:36,960
of whatever the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the day sure we</font>

1160
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,630
all understand how the sponsorship model

1161
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:43,050
works it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not whether or not someone is</font>

1162
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:44,250
is sponsoring we want to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font>

1163
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,600
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about whether they paid</font>

1164
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:46,950
twenty-five thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars fifty</font>

1165
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:49,650
thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars or five dollars</font>

1166
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:51,600
question is should they is it marketing

1167
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:54,990
and when do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you cross from outreach into</font>

1168
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:56,700
marketing with that I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it up to</font>

1169
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:59,160
any final questions and then if not

1170
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:08,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to move on to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the next two</font>

1171
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:11,310
talks Rick us from Microsoft operations

1172
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:15,420
so basically just dissipation related to

1173
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:18,960
six if it is a non costing model how

1174
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:20,760
this operations work there I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

1175
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably speak to that if I'm wrong</font>

1176
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Patrick and certainly correct me they</font>

1177
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:27,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">collect a one-time fee from their</font>

1178
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:29,430
members so they get a port fee plus the

1179
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:31,140
cost of the optic they do give people

1180
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:33,060
the option that give them money whether

1181
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:35,040
it's as done as a monthly recurring fee

1182
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:36,810
or is a one-time donation or is a yearly

1183
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,610
donation it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small amount</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1184
00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:40,710
money they have a contract with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1185
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:42,960
company that effectively operates the

1186
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:44,310
the i-x for them for i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think twenty five</font>

1187
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,300
thousand dollars a year is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1188
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:49,860
Patrick familiy good yeah it's a very

1189
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">small amount of money that is easily</font>

1190
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,760
covered by that and then the cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1191
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardware is covered through both a mix</font>

1192
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,820
of donations and there's one time fee

1193
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:58,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks</font>

1194
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:10,510
are you okay yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> John</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

1195
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:12,910
asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know yes okay</font>

1196
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:14,380
Joan two different links I don't want to

1197
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,250
come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or defensive but could you</font>

1198
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:17,250
put slide 12 up

1199
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:29,288
I don't worry which one is light off

1200
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:31,859
it's the one with the discussing an

1201
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:31,859
amateur model

1202
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:43,038
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did feel a little bit defrauded by</font>

1203
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:47,119
that slide because some you're quite

1204
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:50,750
right there are shall we say pseudo

1205
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,779
member exchanges where the votes are not

1206
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:56,990
binding and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board's non-binding in</font>

1207
00:49:53,779 --> 00:50:00,710
the way you've described but it is a

1208
00:49:56,990 --> 00:50:02,689
fact that votes are binding links it's

1209
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:04,849
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of our M&A you you could</font>

1210
00:50:02,690 --> 00:50:06,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">have downloaded read that and it is a</font>

1211
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:09,289
fact that the board is a fully

1212
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:11,029
functioning board it's not an advisory

1213
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:14,000
board it actually has complete control

1214
00:50:11,029 --> 00:50:16,880
so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> our picture is an illustration</font>

1215
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:21,380
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular case to seem a bit a</font>

1216
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:22,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit like marketing yep a little</font>

1217
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:25,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit but yeah I would agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1218
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:27,619
mean I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's marketing and</font>

1219
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,538
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about marketing I do you</font>

1220
00:50:27,619 --> 00:50:31,849
take my point about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's in correcting</font>

1221
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:35,630
right and this is why I didn't say links

1222
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:38,900
member votes are right but you got to

1223
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:42,009
admit the question is right<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> graphic</font>

1224
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:46,009
phrases my question perfectly that's all

1225
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:50,000
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say the graphic absolutely</font>

1226
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:54,440
incorrectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> phrases your question turn</font>

1227
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:58,309
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I'm told we have to close the</font>
