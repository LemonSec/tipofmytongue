00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:13,860
so I'm Eddie Winstead I<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for ISC but</font>

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,950
today i'm here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to present to you all a</font>

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,849
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> study about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook is</font>

4
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,140
utilizing<font color="#CCCCCC"> kiya hook points for</font>

5
00:00:19,849 --> 00:00:26,160
modernizing their production data

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,820
centers so a little bit about me i guess

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,308
i've been with<font color="#CCCCCC"> IC since 2011 seen a lot</font>

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,980
of course one of the very humbling

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,489
things about working at ISC relates to

10
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,839
you all's insanity<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so we we're</font>

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:48,030
really good at a low layer protocol

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,320
development design and coding right but

13
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,180
then you guys come along and you do

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">really insane things with this software</font>

15
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,620
so thank you for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright so this</font>

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,900
talk is a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook doing crazy</font>

17
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:03,899
things so my apologies to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:07,560
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so and this is uh this is</font>

19
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:12,360
mostly from the Facebook perspective so

20
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,940
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> kia well I SC dhcp is our dhcp</font>

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,479
server open source freely available etc

22
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:20,399
etc it is now 21 years old right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

23
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,460
legal drinking age no matter where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

24
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,380
are and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm very aware that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it has</font>

25
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,119
driven many of you to drink yes if it

26
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,949
has please raise your hand<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very good</font>

27
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,630
so it you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really it's been</font>

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good it's stable what's done what</font>

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,089
it's supposed to do it's certainly

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:41,100
pretty slow by modern standards there's

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,409
that flat file thing that you have to

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,429
store your lease information into a text

33
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:49,740
file maybe not what you want these days

34
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,659
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know Oh mapi which I'm</font>

35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,810
certain has driven many of you to drink

36
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,790
and get hands again yes ok so there's

37
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:59,130
way via<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh mapi that you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

38
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,560
configuration to a running dhcp server

39
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,908
without having to restart it it's not

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">fully functional and it's quite</font>

41
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:08,789
cumbersome to put it mildly and then

42
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,258
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole issue of DHCP fell</font>

43
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:11,909
over and this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

44
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:14,638
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook was encountering is that they</font>

45
00:02:11,909 --> 00:02:16,950
had their dhcp servers essentially

46
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,610
behind a load balancer and they had it

47
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,130
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

48
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,590
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer arrangement one of them was</font>

49
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,000
essentially active the other was sourced

50
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,150
and by they<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do away with this</font>

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then yeah those those man pages</font>

52
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:37,350
so dhcpd<font color="#E5E5E5"> comp man page our apologies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so about kia itself it is a dhcp</font>

54
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,450
server only so there's three parts to

55
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,280
the whole dhcp thing and and also i

56
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,679
realized that dhcp is sort of like the

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,370
broccoli of network operations it's not

58
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:55,620
that exciting right but bear with me so

59
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:58,380
for kia we have dhcp server only if you

60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">are familiar with ISC dhcp we also have</font>

61
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,380
a relay that essentially takes the

62
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:07,530
broadcast packets makes them unicast to

63
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,500
to find a dhcp server somewhere and then

64
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client side so we didn't feel like</font>

65
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,239
relay or client needed any attention if

66
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> differing thoughts on that</font>

67
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:22,860
please let me know either at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mic or</font>

68
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:25,410
afterwards so yeah it is our alternative

69
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,010
to ISC dhcp of course the standards

70
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:32,400
compliant open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source it does do v6 HP</font>

71
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:36,079
v6 and dhcp v4 and it's very easily

72
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:38,220
extensible for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> value of easily okay</font>

73
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,650
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how facebook</font>

74
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,940
has extended Kiev via hooks and yeah

75
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,360
these are the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook</font>

76
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted these are what they ended up with</font>

77
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,340
so one thing about the restarts is in

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">facebook's experience in their prior</font>

79
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:00,600
data center deployment magic you know

80
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,160
Nick cards are going bad and you're

81
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,049
changing them out and you're changing

82
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,500
out hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> any time they would make</font>

83
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:10,080
changes to their<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtp configuration it</font>

84
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,180
would take sometimes up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> four hours</font>

85
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">for all those changes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to propagate okay</font>

86
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,548
that's a really really long time in 2016

87
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:19,799
so with what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain what</font>

88
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,238
<font color="#E5E5E5">they've done with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kia they've gotten</font>

89
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:24,030
that down to just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

90
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're pretty excited about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

91
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:29,849
also very excited that we actually

92
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">started out with doing really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

93
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:33,420
documentation up front

94
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so a lot of what I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

95
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:40,470
about you you know if you one thing to

96
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,810
know about kia hooks is you have to have

97
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,990
some coding knowledge to make them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

98
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:47,610
and so they are it is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> C++ key is</font>

99
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:49,170
written in C++ as well but if you write

100
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,120
a hook yourself you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do that</font>

101
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">C++ so there is some coding knowledge</font>

102
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,590
required but we do have a developer's

103
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,140
guide that i'll have a link to at the

104
00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:00,510
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the session that that you can</font>

105
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,090
reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

106
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,710
did it they actually started before they

107
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,969
contacted us they went through the

108
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,870
developer's guide and this is how they

109
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">develop their hooks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all right</font>

110
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:16,170
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of what I just said but the</font>

111
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,659
important thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that so you have you</font>

112
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:21,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the dhcp traffic that's that</font>

113
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,930
happens and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what these hook points are</font>

114
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:27,030
allowing you to do is make insert your

115
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,980
own logic at<font color="#CCCCCC"> differing places in the</font>

116
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:34,500
process okay so here's a little slide

117
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,750
that sort of represents this so we have

118
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,870
the dhcp packet processing going on and

119
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,480
at various points in this processing we

120
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:46,050
can call out to custom code that either

121
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,370
you write yourself or we write we have a

122
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of hooks that are available with</font>

123
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:54,390
kia in<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook's example they did all</font>

124
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,890
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves so part of this is that</font>

125
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">we really want you to try it out and do</font>

126
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:59,340
those insane things that you do and then

127
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,310
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us and let us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

128
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,710
working if you develop a hook please do

129
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,300
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us and please do let us know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

130
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,200
it went and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you're doing with</font>

131
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,320
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's some links because</font>

132
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:15,060
you know I wasn't involved with the

133
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook team so I'm talking about</font>

134
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone else's configuration which as</font>

135
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,150
you all know can get you in trouble

136
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:24,450
right so here's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detailed</font>

137
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,849
information facebook has been very open

138
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,550
about this so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't feel you know I</font>

139
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,200
feel I don't feel any discomfort with

140
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,300
sharing what they've already shared

141
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,890
online a couple of slides that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

142
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see actually come from these</font>

143
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:39,390
presentations so but I encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

144
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,350
go out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hear it directly from</font>

145
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:45,000
them as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so how they're</font>

146
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,770
doing this is

147
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,290
essentially so you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the GE tcp</font>

148
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,000
packet processing happening when they

149
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:53,640
receive a packet they let the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kia server</font>

150
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,830
handle all the deets prodigal things and

151
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,930
that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't sort of call</font>

152
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,990
out to this custom library where they

153
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,490
store what the client traffic has

154
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,620
indicated right because they have to

155
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:08,250
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that later I'll explain</font>

156
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,440
some more of this on the next slide then

157
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,530
they do some funkiness they essentially

158
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:16,440
talk to their own database so their own

159
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:18,539
inventory system<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so they're not</font>

160
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,880
storing any of their least information

161
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:25,560
in with key itself so there's no

162
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,960
database<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing happening within the kia</font>

163
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,030
server itself so database is elsewhere

164
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,210
that's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> their inventory is they</font>

165
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,880
call out to it so for things like you

166
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">know if the client indicates that it's</font>

167
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,169
at this MAC address we send it back this

168
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:43,860
IP address or we tell it the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pixi boot</font>

169
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:46,349
here etc etc so<font color="#CCCCCC"> essentially they skip a</font>

170
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of these steps that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you see in</font>

171
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,610
normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP packet processing and then</font>

172
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,100
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> come back at the end and they hand</font>

173
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,500
the client what it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see and they</font>

174
00:07:53,100 --> 00:08:02,610
let<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kia do all the DHCP protocol talk</font>

175
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:05,150
right so here's the life of a packet at

176
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,650
Facebook and using the library so again

177
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:09,719
packet come in comes in from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client</font>

178
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,739
if you're familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP there's in</font>

179
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,770
v4 and v6 there is a handshake right DCP

180
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:20,280
handshake it's Dora and v4 discover

181
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:24,240
offer requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> acknowledgement v6 is</font>

182
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:27,169
solicit<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> requests and i forget</font>

183
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the final are but you get an idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

184
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:31,380
two of those packets come from the

185
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,570
clients who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the server</font>

186
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:37,140
ok so this handshake routine that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

187
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:40,500
have so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook's deployment a</font>

188
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,830
packet comes in facebook again kia

189
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,410
handles all the protocol things they

190
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:49,500
then do this call they essentially store

191
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:51,839
what the client has sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then they</font>

192
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:55,709
have kia call out to their again their

193
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,660
database inventory system the memory

194
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:59,099
cache thing there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> x</font>

195
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,560
one of their war stories right when they

196
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,870
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> started doing this they they made</font>

197
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,489
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the inventory system fall over right</font>

198
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,470
so that's always that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good one</font>

199
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:11,850
right so they had to do some in memory

200
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:14,820
cache for their database system they get

201
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:16,290
the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they need again you</font>

202
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what IP address they're going to</font>

203
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:20,490
hand out to the client whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it needs</font>

204
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pixie boot etc etc they give that</font>

205
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:27,390
back to the the hook point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> kia a</font>

206
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:30,120
store that in the context object that

207
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:33,060
you see there then they essentially skip

208
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:37,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key of processing of deciding on a</font>

209
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,540
subnet deciding on a lease or<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

210
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:40,920
like that so they because they don't

211
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">need it they've already done the</font>

212
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,280
assignment themselves right so then they

213
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,900
come in at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packets in hook point and</font>

214
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,060
they put all their information from

215
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">their inventory system into the packet</font>

216
00:09:51,060 --> 00:10:00,930
they let<font color="#E5E5E5"> kia do the protocol talk again</font>

217
00:09:53,460 --> 00:10:03,000
and everybody's happy okay so apologies

218
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,370
for the cat photo if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't like them</font>

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">I happen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like them this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook</font>

220
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:11,580
slide though so here's another nice

221
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,890
thing that folks really like about key

222
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,990
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that facebook</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit as well is that the</font>

223
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,350
config file is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSON</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's</font>

224
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:23,160
no there's not what you're used to with

225
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:26,460
dhcp decom so it's in JSON format so

226
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,219
they're able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to easily automate sitting</font>

227
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:31,650
out config files to various servers so

228
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,060
they like this a lot so here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

229
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:38,250
basic one where we're doing some logging

230
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:40,020
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP for part and you see where</font>

231
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:43,740
we're calling our hooks library they are

232
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:46,140
excuse me we're doing this on interface

233
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,630
eat<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 and then some you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some least</font>

234
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,000
time things but here's where the the

235
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,830
funniness starts for facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:58,140
does anyone know what they just did

237
00:10:52,830 --> 00:11:02,480
there they define all of ipv4 private

238
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:04,980
and public as a subnet awesome right

239
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is the insanity that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> love from</font>

240
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,240
you guys the reason they did that is and

241
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,529
this

242
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,480
I you know candidly speaking when they

243
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,779
when Facebook finally contacted us and

244
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,149
told us what they were doing they were

245
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:25,689
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kia in production data centers at</font>

246
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:29,200
a 091 release right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our immediate</font>

247
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,320
reaction was this made us very happy the

248
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:35,980
one right after that is like oh crap

249
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:37,630
Seto<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh No anyway when they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted here</font>

250
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:41,020
they didn't we didn't have host

251
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,370
reservations available right so they

252
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:44,079
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

253
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that in their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> inventory database so</font>

254
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:49,390
since they're skipping all the subnet

255
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:50,620
selection and all that fun stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

256
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:53,649
know since we didn't have host

257
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:58,830
reservation they just define ipv4 as

258
00:11:53,649 --> 00:12:02,800
their subnet that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

259
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:04,930
that's how they're doing things they

260
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,910
have again shared their hook code I

261
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,689
didn't include it with Z slides but I

262
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,199
did include the link here I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

263
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,420
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about six slides their hooks code</font>

264
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,370
and again it's it's out there go take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

265
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,860
look at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see exactly what</font>

266
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:26,920
they're doing with the dhcp packets and

267
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:29,320
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so this is an</font>

268
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,329
interesting concept so again back to

269
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,100
what you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with things that we</font>

270
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:34,660
never expect one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that</font>

271
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've already come back to us and said</font>

272
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,100
hey that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really awesome that we can</font>

273
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:42,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">hook into back in databases to store our</font>

274
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:45,250
lease information what if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could also</font>

275
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,779
store our config in the database right

276
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:50,829
so that's something that we hadn't

277
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:53,170
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that's not available yet but</font>

278
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:54,520
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we're very highly</font>

279
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,490
considering so if you have thoughts on

280
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">that please let me know afterwards but</font>

281
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,000
essentially there's this is still<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

282
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,699
same idea right there's these points

283
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:06,040
within the dhcp processing that we can

284
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,660
call out to different things on the

285
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what their</font>

286
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:14,020
database is i will say that kia you can

287
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:18,370
hook into my sequel or<font color="#E5E5E5"> postgres</font>

288
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:20,980
currently there are other databases soon

289
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,480
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be coming Cassandra will be pretty</font>

290
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:27,270
soon we have someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

291
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,560
essentially donating that code to us

292
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,220
they've already written it it's already

293
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,959
working for them but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of gets</font>

294
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:36,150
us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this crazy concept I mean we're</font>

295
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:40,410
you possibly you're familiar with like

296
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:42,270
stateless configuration and ipv6 but

297
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:45,180
that usually doesn't involve a dhcp

298
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:47,579
server right so this gives us some some

299
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:53,790
interesting things to start to start

300
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:55,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about right you can do things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

301
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">your database and it doesn't affect your</font>

302
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:03,330
you're running dhcp service in other

303
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:09,360
words all right so some additional hooks

304
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:12,030
examples you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can read them here we again</font>

305
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,070
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you know the beauty of</font>

306
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,110
what we do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really know what</font>

307
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:18,360
crazy thing you're going to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

308
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:23,040
so please do crazy things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and let</font>

309
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,350
us know<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so your hook here this</font>

310
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,569
gets to another crazy thing right so

311
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">anycast dhcp so part of this is just</font>

312
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:32,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting you all to think about wow what</font>

313
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:34,560
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we change things okay this is</font>

314
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,750
actually what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook is doing in their</font>

315
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,079
data centers their dhcp servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

316
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,960
answer on one IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

317
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:45,480
there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do this by</font>

318
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:48,930
having the inventory system on the

319
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">backend and having their kia servers</font>

320
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:55,199
DHCP servers only through the dhcp talk

321
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,920
right so this brings up some<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

322
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:03,030
things right who in here has had pain

323
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,439
about dhcp failover<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah some people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

324
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,350
raising both of their hands that's

325
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,620
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> great all right so dhcp failover</font>

326
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,780
is actually it's a protocol design thing

327
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,240
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISE dhcp certainly implements it</font>

328
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:19,050
but the design is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have fell</font>

329
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:23,250
over pairs right so this can be

330
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:25,199
problematic right one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

331
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,560
probably the guy that raise both hands

332
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,380
if one if if you actually enter a fell

333
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,339
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation getting them a resync</font>

334
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:36,089
back up when the problem is resolved

335
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,800
takes a ver

336
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,379
a long conversation between those

337
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:42,870
servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right this is an operational</font>

338
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:44,910
nightmare right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you need the</font>

339
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,199
server to be handing<font color="#CCCCCC"> out addresses not</font>

340
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:51,120
resyncing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so with this if we hook</font>

341
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,740
into now I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make clear that if</font>

342
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:56,040
what I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the</font>

343
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:58,290
protocol level or not the the protocol

344
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,240
to find dhcp failover what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm saying is</font>

345
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's a possibility and some</font>

346
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,860
people are already doing it we're

347
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,529
testing it out ourselves because people

348
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">other people came up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this idea but</font>

349
00:16:07,529 --> 00:16:12,059
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

350
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:14,279
have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know n plus 1 DHCP servers and</font>

351
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,540
they all hook into a database right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

352
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,800
if they're all hooking into the same

353
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:22,170
database the source could possibly solve

354
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:29,819
this failover problem this fell over

355
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:32,069
pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what else do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to say</font>

356
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:33,059
about this one this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is one</font>

357
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:34,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the ones that we're really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> excited</font>

358
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:39,959
about because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that fell over is</font>

359
00:16:34,949 --> 00:16:45,359
is a historically problematic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

360
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:47,910
let's see<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right all right here's a</font>

361
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,059
little reference slide this is sort of

362
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:53,189
just how you would build your hooks

363
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:56,850
library this is for your reference

364
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:58,800
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll say that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

365
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,559
interested in developing your own hooks

366
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,389
please do go read the developer's guide

367
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:06,869
that's where you're going to get like

368
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:11,250
real examples and real guidance on how

369
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:13,979
you do these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things okay if you have</font>

370
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,500
some hooks issues if you have a crash

371
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,929
for example we hope not but if you do

372
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,059
there these may this may be one of the

373
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:24,059
problems you may need to rebuild with a

374
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:26,490
new version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kia etc if you're seeing</font>

375
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,960
some memory growth it may be that your

376
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:34,289
hooks library is not freeing up memory

377
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:36,270
and always try to sort of take out your

378
00:17:34,289 --> 00:17:39,090
hooks and see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kia works without them</font>

379
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:40,230
see if it's really a hooks problem the

380
00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:42,330
other thing and this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

381
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that Facebook and</font>

382
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:46,949
the other people who are already running

383
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:48,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">kiya are benefiting from is that this is</font>

384
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,630
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I really like about it is that</font>

385
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:53,879
there's differing loggers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

386
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:55,769
there's sort of a master logger and then

387
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,860
there's all these other loggers that you

388
00:17:55,769 --> 00:18:01,350
can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so for this example if I'm</font>

389
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">having a problem with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my hooks I can set</font>

390
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,049
the hooks logger to debug and everything

391
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:10,590
else remains at a same setting so that

392
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:12,570
my logs don't overflow okay there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are if</font>

393
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,149
you look in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentation we have I</font>

394
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:18,029
don't know about 40<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these loggers</font>

395
00:18:15,149 --> 00:18:22,080
right now with more on the way so we're

396
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:24,269
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this part as well and</font>

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">of course with standard like you can of</font>

398
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:28,679
course with debugging you can raise it

<font color="#E5E5E5">as high as you like based on what</font>

exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find out all</font>

from our developers so please make use

of that just a note here that there are

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have one of the dhcp coders in</font>

426
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:47,429
the room he's hiding right so hopefully

427
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of you will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me a question that I</font>

428
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:53,580
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to defer to him that'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be great all</font>

429
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,659
right go ahead Carlos Carlos presented

430
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,039
with dine

431
00:19:54,659 --> 00:20:01,470
very cool features<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

432
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:03,989
nitpick would be and I don't know how

433
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:08,129
difficult it would be to much to achieve

434
00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:09,570
but if you could make it so that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

435
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:12,959
hooks<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be written in other</font>

436
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:16,908
languages other than C++ like Python

437
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,200
something more friendly that'll be great

438
00:20:16,909 --> 00:20:20,970
Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Sean do you want to come up</font>

439
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:28,200
and address that question to the

440
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:31,289
microphone there is yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean with your</font>

441
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISA yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that we have</font>

442
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:35,669
plans to do eventually but it's

443
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:38,489
something we classify is relatively low

444
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,659
priority so it's not going to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

445
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:44,489
until we get a lot of other features

446
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:47,429
done first thanks Sean<font color="#CCCCCC"> um is there</font>

447
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:51,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">anyone from facebook that wants to step</font>

451
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,220
curious if you have I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a</font>

452
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:06,629
contributing callbacks that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

453
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,220
there already and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> pini</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

454
00:21:06,629 --> 00:21:11,609
going to incorporate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook's changes</font>

455
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:14,009
into your base code Sean you want to

456
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:15,869
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> note we have some hooks the the</font>

457
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:19,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook changes I don't think they gave</font>

458
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:21,439
those explicitly back to us go ahead I

459
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:24,960
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember what Facebook actually</font>

460
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:27,859
gave us and so on we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a contribs</font>

461
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:30,749
and we're in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of figuring out</font>

462
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:32,939
how to handle things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like cooks and so</font>

463
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:35,820
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that it's clear to contributed</font>

464
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,859
code and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supporting it so you</font>

465
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:39,720
understand when you start using it

466
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:41,249
whether we're supporting it whether

467
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,929
somebody else might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be supporting it</font>

468
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:46,320
whether it's just not supported at all

469
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:48,690
so we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans for trying to</font>

470
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,460
provide spaces for contributed code and

471
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,070
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't quite decided exactly what</font>

472
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,229
they'll be yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one other</font>

473
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,749
operational question yes little<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kia work</font>

474
00:21:55,229 --> 00:22:00,509
in conjunction with existing ISC dhcpd

475
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:01,889
to in a failover state so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could slowly</font>

476
00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:04,289
migrated from one platform to the other

477
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:06,820
no

478
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">kia itself doesn't do the failover</font>

479
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:13,389
protocol yet that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we'll see</font>

480
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:15,549
about doing as Eddie mentioned we can

481
00:22:13,389 --> 00:22:18,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">potentially do a lot of the same</font>

482
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:22,029
functionality a failover with the

483
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:23,710
databases we're testing that now to see

484
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:25,570
to try and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there aren't any</font>

485
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:29,230
corner cases that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hose over</font>

486
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:31,869
people so eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

487
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:35,350
failover in if that's not sufficient but

488
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:37,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">again it's fell over is something that's</font>

489
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,779
a big chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work and we'd like to get</font>

490
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:42,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bunch of other features done first</font>

491
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:44,679
yeah the other thing of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is we we</font>

492
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:50,080
feel like databases have done fell over

493
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:53,109
pretty well maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than the fill</font>

494
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,418
over protocol so again that's something

495
00:22:53,109 --> 00:23:01,869
that we're listening feedback on and

496
00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:04,480
experience on<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well thanks</font>

497
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:07,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your time enjoy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of</font>

498
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,200
your time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Chicago</font>
