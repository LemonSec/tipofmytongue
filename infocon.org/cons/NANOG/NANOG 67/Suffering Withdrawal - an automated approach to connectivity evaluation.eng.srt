hi I'm Tim Hoffman this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is micah Groff</font>

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:12,469
and what I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you about</font>

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,449
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of micronized</font>

4
00:00:12,469 --> 00:00:16,669
struggle with for probably about a year

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:20,359
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were at Twitter and something</font>

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:21,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we ran into previous employers and</font>

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,330
ultimately what it comes down to with

8
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:26,509
some limitations and how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can deal</font>

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:32,449
with failures with bgp a lot of the

10
00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:34,690
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with</font>

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:38,480
network failures today so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

12
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:41,120
today we have Isis we have bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> yard</font>

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,550
transport link fails and we end up in a

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,489
position where we move right surround by

15
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,349
Isis bgp sessions go down facing a

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:51,470
transit provider and we're in a position

17
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,860
where we move we move to other trans at

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,960
links or peering looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we have a CD</font>

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in cash that might go down we might be</font>

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,220
running bgp to it or some health checks

21
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:04,369
and we are in a position we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,840
traffic around via those routing

23
00:01:04,369 --> 00:01:08,780
protocols and health checks do all this

24
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,749
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well in certain circumstances the</font>

25
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:13,789
challenge you run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> has when you win</font>

26
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:16,429
this isn't enough so what happens if

27
00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:20,420
there's no way to detect a black hole

28
00:01:16,429 --> 00:01:23,319
and condition so all of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> situations</font>

29
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:26,799
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen by either</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike and myself</font>

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,229
example is let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the CDN provider</font>

35
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:45,049
and I have a trans single transit

36
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,700

37
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:50,329
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> choice there and I'm on an</font>

38
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:53,030
internet exchange now my CDN node on my

39
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:55,249
pop is advertising a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP routes</font>

40
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,539
to the my router and then I'm

41
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,240
advertising their own words to an

42
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:01,219
internet exchange so if my transit

43
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,869
provider fails I'm still advertising

44
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:04,850
these routes out to the internet

45
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,469
exchange and I'm in a position where

46
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,600
this user is coming to me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this</font>

47
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:10,280

<font color="#E5E5E5">their requests so in the scenario</font>

00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,859
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could do</font>

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to stop and you know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">size of the routing table and taking a</font>

router out of service based on that but

61
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,070
then you're in a position where let's

62
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,720
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Tier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one has an issue you're</font>

63
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:46,160
actually got a very real danger of all

64
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,420
of your router's withdrawing the routes

65
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:53,000
at once the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example is if a service</font>

66
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,700
node is isolated from the backbone say

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,880
you basically the same scenario except

68
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,220
that rather than having a transit based

69
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:04,940
backhaul network you're in using<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

own backhaul and in Brazil at Twitter

71
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,480
we've found it's reasonably common that

72
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,000
you lose multiple links at once because

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,369
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nature of their country so you</font>

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,620
end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a position whereby you now</font>

75
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,270
have no connectivity back and again the

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,610
user is coming in across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

77
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:22,520
exchange to a CDN server which is

78
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:27,080
advertising its route still to a router

79
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,459
and your black hole in your traffic and

80
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,980
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next thing is what if</font>

81
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,459
actual black holding action happens

82
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,709
across router hardware so for instance

83
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:38,540
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone at some point is run</font>

84
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:40,370
into some sort of horrible bug where

85
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,870
routers decided just to discard traffic

86
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,780
but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the routing protocol up and</font>

87
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:48,440
if you end up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> position how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

88
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:50,269
actually tie some traffic to some actual

89
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,940
real-world traffic to the routing

90
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:56,630
protocols and the fact that journalist

91
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:58,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">RPM or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um Cisco IP slot isn't able to be</font>

92
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,640
directly tied to routing protocol

93
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:06,350
actions yet into 2016<font color="#CCCCCC"> is absolutely</font>

94
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:07,609
terrible so for all these problems how

95
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:09,829
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we deal with us and how do we</font>

96
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,630
actually tie this together and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

97
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,180
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a fourth problem that we've</font>

98
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:16,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">identified here which is slightly</font>

99
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,500
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> but let's say we have a lag</font>

100
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:21,168
facing an engineered exchange and their

101
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,690
internet exchange is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know its a</font>

102
00:04:21,168 --> 00:04:25,640
50 gig leg and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing 40 gig of</font>

traffic over it now<font color="#E5E5E5"> again just picking</font>

104
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,700
on Brazil because it's a really

105
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,200
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> example there are some</font>

106

to serve in Brazil and some that we're

108
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,110
actually

109
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,370
bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay moving out to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Miami you</font>

110
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,350

115
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,870
shared a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of traffic rather</font>

116
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,370
than just using minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> length because</font>

117
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:55,720
if we use minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> length</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we will end up</font>

we're actually able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep a smaller</font>

121
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,809
amount of traffic going ideally would be

00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:24,400
problems we've run into and I guess what

00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,710
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up in a position of is that we</font>

00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,460
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a point where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network wise we</font>

back to a data center or back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to an</font>

136
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,060

00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,210
it has connectivity to multiple origins

138
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,070
or just one origin data center and these

139
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,289
sort of problems started and we started

140
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:52,240
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually we need some way of</font>

evaluating that state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our routing</font>

routes and what we started doing is

144
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,690
using the rudimentary conditional

145
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,360
routing functionality that we have in CA

146
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,900
juniper router or an ASR and started any

147
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,150
casting a / 32 from all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our data</font>

148
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,070
centers all of our pops then started

149
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:15,580
examining this and saying if I can see

150
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:17,560
this one / 32 I'm in service otherwise I

151
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,120
removed myself from service<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the</font>

152
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,950
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this I'd liken this to a</font>

153
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,030
blunt hammer and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were in a</font>

154
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:27,599
position where while this did the job we

155
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:30,580
had a single / 32 we had no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of</font>

156
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,290
incrementally<font color="#E5E5E5"> serling to say do I</font>

157
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,740
actually have good connectivity back to

158
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,390
my origin and what we kind of looked at

159
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,830
was there's got to be a better way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

160
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,870
doing this there's got to be a way where

161
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:43,719
we can evaluate in a more granular

162
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,550
manner do I have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one of my</font>

163
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,160
origin data centers or three of my

164
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,740
origin

165
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,700
centers and i will add pre pens or<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

166
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:56,900
will modify something to reflect this so

167
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,479
obviously the real solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is to</font>

168
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,760
automate and if you're a network like

169
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">twitter or anyone else sighs you're</font>

170
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,940
going to have the resource and you will

171
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,890
automated to the point where you can say

172
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,410
there is some arbitrary check that is

173
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,409
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if that check failed</font>

174
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:15,290
you're going to take some action<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

175
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:17,150
this case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> might say we're going to</font>

176
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:19,460
lock you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font>

177
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:23,179
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> router or monitor for SNMP traps or</font>

178
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:25,520
you know you do some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of check every</font>

179
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,140
X minutes we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask it how many</font>

180
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">I in Saints neighbors it has for example</font>

181
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,539
and then we're going to say right I have

182
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:33,830
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I insane its neighbors this is a bad</font>

183
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,480
state I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take you out of</font>

184
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,880
service and I'm going to modify some

185
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,700
configuration to remove remove this

186
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:45,350
router from being in service now<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

187
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:47,300
all well and good but ultimately if your

188
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:49,670
router is in service<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you had a band</font>

190
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,780
no backhaul and you're out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> band is</font>

191
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,880
not working either which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font>

192
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">that does happen in some of these more</font>

193

remote locations in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world then you</font>

194
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,130
have no way of touching the router you

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,989
would not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a position where</font>

196
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,659
you have to tell the local operator to

00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:08,690
go and remove the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> from dirac I've</font>

198
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,030
done this before and this was the case

199
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:13,460
where two backhaul circuits were out of

200
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,440
service and we were in a position where

201
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> outer band was also out of service</font>

202
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,640
because the outer banners it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned out</font>

203
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,280
relied on another operator that used the

204
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:25,849
same to back all paths this wasn't a

207
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:33,620
have out of band you're fairly stupid

208
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,240
but ultimately you know some some people

209
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,880
are unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some places an</font>

difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget an out-of-band</font>

213
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,990
that you can build a data center in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

214
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,640
is not subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all their local</font>

215
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:51,410
regulations they have a free trade zone

216
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:53,030
there and supplying an engineer

217
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:56,089
connection into that free trade zone is

218
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:58,910
harder than you might think or let's

219
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:59,720
face it if you're a two men if you've

220
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,579
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> two people</font>

221
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,889
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> operations stuff you might</font>

222
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:06,529
not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resourcing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build an a an</font>

223
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:08,779
automated remediation system so suddenly

224
00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:11,420
we're now in a position where we're

225
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:12,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">having a page of human and it too am the</font>

226
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,449
human does not think straight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

227
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,259
takes 15 minutes to wake up and then 10

228
00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:21,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes to mitigate so we need a way to</font>

229
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:22,970
do this at the routing layer and the

230
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,980
real thing we've started to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

231
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:30,170
is how could we solve this so obviously

232
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:32,230
being in a position to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know do a</font>

233
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,599
single conditioner route and start to

234
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:37,370
depend<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know one route existing</font>

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,870
across your network and there's one

236
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:40,819
configuration change you could make two

237
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">hose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that route</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and take all your</font>

238
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:44,149
router's out of service<font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font>

239
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,250
work and looking at some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

240
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:50,959
arbitrary state you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

241
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:53,420
run some<font color="#E5E5E5"> right some j slacks as i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font>

242
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about or you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you could do</font>

243
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:59,240
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on the bsd of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> juniper</font>

244
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:01,009
or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux of the ASR you can do all</font>

245
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">these things but they're just kind of</font>

246
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:08,660
hacky and ultimately we want to be able

247
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:12,680
to do do things like do I have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

248
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:15,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">five different dear ones routes can I</font>

249
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">ICMP these five hosts rather than this</font>

250
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:20,480
one metric we might count you know

251
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying if I can't see Microsoft I'm</font>

252
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,379
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out of service means</font>

253
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,809
that this works until Microsoft comes

254
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:30,709
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet however unlikely that</font>

255
00:10:26,809 --> 00:10:32,420
will happen one day and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

256
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:33,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">the thing we haven't we just have not</font>

257
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,410
solved us and we haven't got ourselves

258
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,969
into a position where we can examine the

259
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:40,639
state of our routing table where we can

260
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,410
icmp to a bunch of hosts and then tie

261
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,389
that to routing decisions and tie it to

262
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:49,069
whether a host is healthy and insert em

263
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:53,089
and service and in 2016 I really really

264
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:55,160
believe that we can do a lot better so

265
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,680
one thing that micro and I looked at

266
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:00,199
when we first<font color="#E5E5E5"> started talking about this</font>

267
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we involved Ben and neck and</font>

268
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:04,490
Bruce to start forming a working group

269
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,979
around us is that we looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the</font>

270
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:09,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">RRP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worked the VRP seemed like the</font>

271
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,199
closest thing to a protocol that would

272
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,340
track variables wait them in a priority

273
00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:16,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">value</font>

274
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,770
the intake actions now there are P as we

275
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:22,400
all know I can only have an active or a

276
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:24,980
passive<font color="#E5E5E5"> state you can measure prefix in</font>

277
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,990
a routing table you can check measure

278
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,650
the physical state of div an interface

279
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,030
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then take some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actions on it it</font>

280
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:33,709
it doesn't do exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want but</font>

281
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,990
it leads to<font color="#CCCCCC"> something which is that we</font>

282
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:39,890
have some sort of prioritization metrics

283
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:42,410
and some way to weight against it and I

284
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:44,060
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> vieira appears where we can really</font>

285
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,980
learn something here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can</font>

286
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:49,040
look at the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some sort of</font>

287
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,710
weighted conditional bucket and put

288
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,469
ourselves in a position we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to</font>

289
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:56,390
say should I be in service or should I

290
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:58,580
remove my produced my priority to try

291
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,080
and shift<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jen to try and signal that I</font>

292
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,410
might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as good as my neighbor</font>

293
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,180
router and now my car is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come</font>

294
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:08,319
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk about the new method of</font>

295
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,319
conditional routing that we propose

296
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,790
thanks Tim good<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning everyone as Tim</font>

297
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:19,610
said I'm Micah<font color="#CCCCCC"> kroff i work at github</font>

298
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,860
and one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that i wanted to</font>

299
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,980
talk about before I get into you how we

300
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:27,110
propose solving this problem so when Tim

301
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:28,940
and I first sat down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we were first</font>

302
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:31,670
discussing how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should solve this</font>

303
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,670
problem we came to a very clear decision

304
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:37,610
early on and that is no noob routing

305
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:40,219
protocols and no extensions to do to

306
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:44,420
existing protocols we must leverage what

307
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,840
is pre-existing today in BGP is is and

308
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:49,939
ospf so local pref manipulating local

309
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,880
pref<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s path prepending or applying</font>

310
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,340
neighbor policy in BGP manipulating

311
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,540
metrics and costs in is is or setting

312
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:03,170
the overload bit so with weighted

313
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:04,790
conditional routing how well from the

314
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,640
routers perspective I can determine<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

315
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,010
well am I connected to the backbone or

316
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,530
to my data centers and I can make

317
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:14,630
decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on these conditions</font>

318
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:18,280
whether I<font color="#CCCCCC"> take a router out of service</font>

319
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:21,020
or I shed traffic away from this router

320
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,209
so the concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Tim mentioned and</font>

321
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,230
alluded to is is buckets not a new

322
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,390
concept it's simply a named variable

323
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:30,870
you can have any number of named

324
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:33,270
variables a variable would start at a

325
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:36,630
value of zero with a the greater the

326
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:39,030
value the better connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am you can</font>

327
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:43,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">then reference these values from within</font>

328
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,220
policy and make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision based on them</font>

329
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,240
so tests how many routes do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

330
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:53,280
matching a particular policy or perhaps

331
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,610
maybe I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine how many</font>

332
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,959
routes I haven't in a given table or the

333
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of routes that I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> learning from</font>

334
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:03,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">a particular enable a neighbor and make</font>

335
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:06,719
a decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> based on that we also came up</font>

336
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,820
with the concept of a percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

337
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,700
peers that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> established a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

338
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,920
group so if you have an ibgp peers or a

339
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,650
full mesh maybe you want to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

340
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,969
you have 90<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 95 percent of your bgp</font>

341
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:24,090
sessions established before a router

342
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:25,430
goes into service so an example of one

343
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:28,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">of these tests might be as Tim mentioned</font>

344
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:30,420
how many members do i have in this lag

345
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,320
for each member<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a lag say i have a</font>

346
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:36,660
lag facing am-6 each member will add an

347
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,120
additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 points to this bucket</font>

348
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,990
value and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can make a decision based on</font>

349
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that or can I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> icmp across my backbone</font>

350
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:50,190
using IP SLA or<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpm to my data center or</font>

351
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,439
can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICMP and make a connection to</font>

352
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:56,700
Google or Microsoft or Twitter and then

353
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:59,430
make a decision based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so with</font>

354
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:02,990
these test results I have a test a and I

355
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:07,530
have a bucket say<font color="#CCCCCC"> read if Tess a passes</font>

356
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:11,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">REDD+ gets 100 or test b then green plus</font>

357
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:14,490
gets 200 and then if red falls below 100

358
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:17,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I take an action and then if else if</font>

359
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:20,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Green falls below 200 I can take another</font>

360
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:26,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">action based on this so let's talk about</font>

361
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:28,349
actions so in this example Green has

362
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,579
fallen below my threshold value but

363
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,410
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a router out of</font>

364
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,290
service I just simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to shed to</font>

365
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:37,380
traffic using a s path prepending so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

366
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:38,170
can apply this policy then to a neighbor

367
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,630
or

368
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:45,579
of neighbors or even at a group level to

369
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:47,380
shed traffic away now in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> case we're</font>

370
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:49,989
going to overload the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP in this case</font>

371
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:52,360
is is we have hit a catastrophic failure

372
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,070
and red has fallen below<font color="#CCCCCC"> the threshold</font>

373
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,959
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 and I need to shed traffic</font>

374
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,360
immediately away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> this router so</font>

375
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:00,459
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conditional overload I value</font>

376
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:04,720
my bucket falls below 5 and i

377
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:06,489
immediately shed traffic so in

378
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,459
discussing this and working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this for</font>

379
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,889
roughly the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 months Tim and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I and</font>

380
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:14,619
in conjunction<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Bruce and Nick and</font>

381
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:16,360
Ben cisco and juniper are both actively

382
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,250
involved what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

383
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,350
solicit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano community for feedback</font>

384
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:25,149
so we had a we've come up with a lot of

385
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:27,490
tests and use cases for our environments

386
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,420
and what we've seen in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> careers but</font>

387
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,829
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would make sense in your</font>

388
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,500
environment what have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen that we</font>

00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:35,620
haven't thought of so these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

390
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,149
these tests and actions that we have

come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with that we think we would be</font>

be useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your environment that we</font>

394
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,110
could also integrate so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

395
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:49,329
talked about number of established bgp

396
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:52,449
peers active prefixes in a routing table

397
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:53,649
are the number of next hops but there's

398
00:16:52,449 --> 00:16:58,599
something else out there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font>

399
00:16:53,649 --> 00:17:01,480
haven't thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of another question that</font>

400
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">we wanted to solicit or get feedback on</font>

401
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:05,079
is how do we present prevent these

402
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,559
cascading failures as Tim mentioned with

403
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:10,389
with the the option of running scripts

404
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,160
on a particular box you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

405
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,470
potential to create a cascading failure

when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tier one falls off the the</font>

407
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet ideally we would leave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this up</font>

408
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user and allow the end user to</font>

409
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:24,729
come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the best solution for their</font>

410
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,280
particular environment and we would like

411
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see rather than taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a router out</font>

412
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:31,149
of service as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst case may be</font>

413
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:33,990
shedding traffic for a collection of

414
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,549
neighbors or collection of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP peers</font>

415
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:40,270
look what else could we do to prevent

416
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:43,000
these cascading failures also another in

417
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:48,490
tossing us back around what<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes more</font>

418
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:50,780
sense a percentage or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hard value so in</font>

419
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,450
an example of if I have

420
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:56,840
again I'll use the m6 example 10 members

421
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,930
in a lag do I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> low value if</font>

422
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:03,850
I lose five or fifty percent what<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

423
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:03,850
is more preferred in the configuration

424
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:10,550
so where we have been and where we're

425
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,350
going again we've actively been working

426
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:14,270
with juniper and cisco we've been

427
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,320
working on this roughly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten months we</font>

428
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,420
have commitments from both<font color="#CCCCCC"> june</font>

429
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">francisco to implement this in their</font>

430
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:23,870
platforms in a coming releases so we've

431
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:25,429
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on the working group we</font>

432
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:28,070
were presenting it today<font color="#E5E5E5"> to nanog to</font>

433
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,290
solicit feedback once we get feedback

434
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,889
we're going to submit it as an ietf

435
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,210
draft an RFC and get as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said both</font>

436
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,280
juniper and cisco and we'd love other

437
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:40,640
folks to jump on the wagon for

438
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,700
implementing this technology so please

439
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,040
reach out give us feedback stops in the

440
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">hall we'd love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this or if</font>

441
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,750
you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get hub sticker I have</font>

442
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:53,330
a whole bag full of them but thank you

443
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">for and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will turn it over to Tim for</font>

444
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:58,970
open questions the unity of it so I

445
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,560
guess we're really seeking good feedback

446
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:04,150
so if there's any questions or feedback

447
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,149
about this now would love that

448
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,889
at mat pita yahoo this sounds like great

449
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,740
work we were doing some similar stuff

450
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:23,750
internally but right now everything is

451
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:26,750
still very much in the vendor specific

452
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:28,730
ok we can code this up on this vendor

453
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:33,080
it's not broadly applicable are you

454
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:34,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">asking for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more broadly vendors to get</font>

455
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,250
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say let's define language</font>

456
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,990
do on us as operators to speak up and

457
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,810
say this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would like you to</font>

458
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:43,190
develop in this what level of feedback

459
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:46,460
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> support you looking for it out</font>

460
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,890
clarify um we will operate we really

461
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,300
want operators to come forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell</font>

462
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,600
us what should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in here and i think</font>

463
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:55,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the aim is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to define an RFC which calls</font>

out a preferred way of initiative women

465
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:58,970
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as we know when we've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

466
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,770
you know three vendors doing at

467
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,260
different ways it helps no one so the

468
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,780
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to define a standard that we can</font>

469
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,160
all follow and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't been</font>

474
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,969
we feel there's a great enough support

from juniper and cisco to get to the

476

00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:39,650
would you see it falling into um so

practice as ROC so as the way we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">implement this and I am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first to</font>

admit I will be learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a bit as</font>

491
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:03,590
we go through this<font color="#CCCCCC"> process and we would</font>

492
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">love the any assistance and guidance</font>

493
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:08,629
from anyone that they can provide yeah

494
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,240
and to me it seems like maybe the grow

495
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:13,250
global routing operations working group

496
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,530
would probably be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the closest</font>

497
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:21,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">fit and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> might think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about something</font>

498
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:24,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a use case document and then a</font>

499
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,280
Lucien document absolutely so one thing

500
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:30,419
that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on is we</font>

501
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:32,760
actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> this all modeled in a vmx</font>

502
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:34,650
environment with jute with Jay slacks so

503
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Ben dale has actually written all of</font>

504
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,480
this conditional routing functionality

505
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,399
into there so when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> present well we</font>

506
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,230
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a live demo here when</font>

507
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,880
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> present this to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ATF we can</font>

508
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually pass references to some github</font>

509
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">two links to topologies and</font>

510
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,030
configurations that and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> jace likes</font>

511
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:57,270
to actually allow people to implement it

512
00:21:54,030 --> 00:22:02,700
at home and play around<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it cool</font>

513
00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:04,918
yeah thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the advice I Brandon</font>

514
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,960
Bennett with facebook it seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

515
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,179
lot of the conditions you were talking

516
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,500
about we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> network focus yeah and</font>

517
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,970
obviously there's two sides of the coin

518
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,360
here which is the application as well

519
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,100
yep is there any thoughts or any plans

520
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,899
on trying to have like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> API or some</font>

521
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,000
way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> an application to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> affect this</font>

522
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,390
conditional routing it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

523
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lits can you email through and</font>

524
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,580
let's discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a whole lot more</font>

525
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:31,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">because i think that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a great</font>

526
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:31,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">way to improve this great thanks you I</font>

527
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:40,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Patrick mr mark group um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the idea</font>

528
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:42,840
and I don't want to be ya down on unders

529
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:44,730
anything but I think constructive

530
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,799
criticism is also awesome so don't feel

531
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:49,110
bad about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done a little bit</font>

532
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,610
of work on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having CDN</font>

533
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,740
servers in strange places that may not

534
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:55,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recharge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in servers in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

535
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,380
past and looking at sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly this</font>

536
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,690
the thing that I always came back to is

537
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:02,490
that and this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a principal for</font>

538
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:05,549
literally decades is that you want smart

539
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:09,360
edges and<font color="#E5E5E5"> dumb cores and this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an you</font>

540
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:11,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">know a violent violent breaking of that</font>

541
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,379
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now we have multiple places</font>

542
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,178
where we have to like look for what's

543
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,590
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the router knows what the</font>

544
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:18,890
router knows the application knows what

545
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:21,990
the application knows and so it just

546
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,700
from a from a higher level and maybe you

547
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:25,240
know maybe things have gone past what I

548
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of and that</font>

549
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,720
entirely<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible but from a higher</font>

550
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:31,090
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just think the intelligence</font>

551
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,380
should be on the server<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that we</font>

552
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,909
shouldn't have the routers making these

553
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,070
kind of decisions because the failure

554
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:39,580
cases in the corner cases that this

555
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:42,129
could back us into are both<font color="#CCCCCC"> legion and</font>

556
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,500
terrifying yeah so we're definitely

557
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:46,180
giving if this is implemented it gives

558
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,190
everyone a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of rope to do good things</font>

559
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:51,700
in to hang themselves with that is for

560
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:54,580
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> I agree there's a use case for a</font>

561
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,800
CDN server to inspect its origin and to

562
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:59,409
say whether it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sin sender PGP</font>

563
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,330
announcements but<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps I thing we</font>

564
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:03,670
didn't cover in the talk which we've

566
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,850
have an aggregate route on a local

567
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:08,890
router being triggered by an interface

568
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,050
trap you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are non CD in</font>

569
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:13,000
specific use cases here or non

570
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,909
application server specific use cases as

571
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,310
well so I think the key here is to give

572
00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:21,310
it a set of tools that operators can

573

decide what they want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with from a</font>

00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:26,200
Twitter use case which I can speak to I

575
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,210
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> our aim is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we definitely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

576
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in a position where application</font>

577
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:32,140
servers will withdraw themselves that

578
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,470
withdraw routes under certain conditions

579
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,350
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also to have the network devices</font>

580
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,000
monitoring it and I totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear you</font>

581
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:41,409

582
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">principle but I think having that</font>

583
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,680
function in ollivierre and having that

584
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,210
safeguard could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important</font>

585
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:49,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there is nothing worse than</font>

black holing behavior in your network is
