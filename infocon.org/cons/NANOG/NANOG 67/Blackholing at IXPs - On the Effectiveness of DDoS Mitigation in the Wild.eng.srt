00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright our next speaker is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Christoph</font>

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:23,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">dietzel de kicks and a PhD candidate at</font>

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:25,660
tu Berlin so high as introduced already

4
00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:29,020
my name is Chris and I'm with D kicks

5
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,790
into a bit Berlin as a PhD candidate and

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,550
I going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk today about black</font>

7
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:36,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">warning it at ice peace I'd like to</font>

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,718
<font color="#CCCCCC">introduce this topic to you and tell you</font>

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,210
how it works on from a technical

10
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,430
perspective and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> present</font>

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:47,050
you some results of a measurement study

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:51,699
we recently conducted so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a joint</font>

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:56,050
work with Anya and Thomas and let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

14
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:58,839
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off so as we all know d dos</font>

15
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:01,599
attacks remain a serious threat so we

16
00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:04,089
sort of trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look into it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since</font>

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,970
like 20<font color="#E5E5E5"> years I checked back on</font>

18
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:10,060
publications in the academia are there

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:13,990
since like at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least 15 years so we all</font>

20
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:16,240
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost daily we see great</font>

21
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,979
news about videos it's not getting

22
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,949
better it seems that it's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> worse</font>

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:27,790
so new attacks skyrocketing in 2015 we

24
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,550
also see okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're on new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peaks like</font>

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:32,740
400 gigabits per second attacks and all

26
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,149
this stuff is going on on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other hand</font>

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">we see more commercial products that are</font>

28
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,290
entering the market like<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,360
scrubbing services so that they take

30
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your traffic and sort of scrub</font>

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,370
it and remove a lot of data traffic in

32
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:53,530
order to make the volume handle handle

33
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,320
so that you can just just work the

34
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:01,630
amount of data or traffic volume that

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,850
you receive so however there's also an

36
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,160
technique which is called black holing

37
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:08,348
it's an operational technique and I'm

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,878
confident that most of you know it it's

39
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:14,109
a technique to counter<font color="#E5E5E5"> do those attacks</font>

40
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:17,299
and basically you can trigger it by

41
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:20,900
announcing a prefix under attack

42
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,780
and this traffic test in towards this

43
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,460
prefix is dropped then so this only

44
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,280
works if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are the owner of the IP</font>

45
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:32,510
prefix and then you can just announce it

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:35,030
for black holing through bgp this might

47
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,760
not be like your first option so it's

48
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,120
rather sort of a last resort so you

49
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,040
would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it if it's really bad and</font>

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,660
you really experienced congestion and

51
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,390
can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle the traffic volume</font>

52
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:50,180
anymore so don't consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as like</font>

53
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,549
something you you want to switch on if

54
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:54,650
you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the server gets too much</font>

55
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,840
load but rather if there's really bad

56
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,740
conscience and really bad things<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

57
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,520
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is actually a well-known</font>

58
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:07,820
concept for a while but my point here is

59
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">now it's introduced at X</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece all over</font>

60
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,299
Europe so it's for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea cakes</font>

61
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:18,890
msk<font color="#CCCCCC"> IX</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> neta eggs next see that and more</font>

62
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:22,730
more to come so just a professor e2 to

63
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:26,390
be on the same ground so as many of you

64
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,910
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was first sort of</font>

65
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,600
on per device basis so you could install

66
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:36,109
now roads for certain prefixes within 11

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:40,579
router or just for one router and then

68
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:44,959
later it was a standardized into 2002 to

69
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:47,660
be use for ibgp like a central spot

70
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,630
within the network to drop the traffic

71
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,540
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced towards all routers within</font>

72
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,660
the internal network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> between 2005</font>

73
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:00,500
and 2007 we saw that major eyes peas

74
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:02,600
like basically all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea ones offer</font>

75
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:06,950
this as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> value-added services for the</font>

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,410
customers and since 2010 we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

77
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:14,290
ISP started to adapt adapt<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

78
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:18,399
technique so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in a nutshell</font>

79
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:23,719
explain how black holing at IXPs works

80
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:26,150
so here we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an example how the</font>

81
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">situation could be there are like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

82
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:30,830
customer edge routers connected or

83
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,610
interconnecting at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ax</font>

84
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:37,580
p and we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the asd receives the</font>

85
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:42,680
text from a subset<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ASA's present</font>

86
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:44,690
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I XP so but not only that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asd</font>

87
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,330
experience in attack and rising traffic

88
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:51,040
volumes consider also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that even the</font>

89
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:53,780
peering link might be congested or like

90
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,350
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> center network or networked</font>

91
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:59,659
over the data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> or services server</font>

92
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">classes within the data center or the</font>

93
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:08,780
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> itself the customer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

94
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:11,900
itself so solution here is that the

95
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:16,340
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is under attack either a /</font>

96
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,219
32 less specific prefix can be announced

97
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:22,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">for black holing by asd so by this</font>

98
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:26,080
actually the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASD which is under attack</font>

99
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:29,030
sets a specific next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop IP address</font>

100
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,159
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is well defined and this IP</font>

101
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:33,440
address signals to all the other

102
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:36,680
customers that the traffic should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

103
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,210
dropped by adding a community you can

104
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,940
also control which customers should

105
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:46,340
receive this prefix in which not so

106
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,350
actually for bgp we have here they're

107
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,640
all server in between which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just</font>

108
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:56,290
removed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplicity reasons so and as</font>

109
00:05:52,640 --> 00:06:00,229
soon as this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is announced we see that</font>

110
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:03,020
the two other<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> accept this prefix</font>

111
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:08,570
and the traffic is dropped at the XP on

112
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:11,870
the behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asd so this is a situation</font>

113
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:14,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you can stop traffic coming from</font>

114
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,180
certain a SS but you still enable some

115
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:22,610
other a SS to send you<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic to this</font>

116
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:25,730
prefix or to any other so however we we

117
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:30,860
know that this technique exists we know

118
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:33,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">that many a SS might make use of it but</font>

119
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,420
actually we want to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

120
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,940
really frequently used and how is it

121
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">used or do we offer value-added service</font>

122
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,110
that it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken up by the</font>

123
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,480
community and what's the impact on

124
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,820
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean an announcements</font>

125
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:49,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">anbe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gps control plane but what actually</font>

126
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,950
happens on the data plane and very

127
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,200
important for us especially me and my

128
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,270
position<font color="#CCCCCC"> as part of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D kicks R&D team</font>

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,250
is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we actually improve this</font>

130
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:04,039
value added service how can we improve

131
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:07,100
black holing so therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> we conducted a</font>

132
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:10,340
measurement study so over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> course of</font>

133
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,080
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> month we captured 23,000 black</font>

134
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:16,609
holing<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements at the route server</font>

135
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:19,550
and to visualize here what was going on

136
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:22,040
over the period we plotted the number of

137
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:25,430
announcements so this blood basically

138
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:29,060
shows the / 32 black<font color="#E5E5E5"> holing</font>

139
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:31,400
announcements it's the blue dashed line

140
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,810
and you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually as a daily</font>

141
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:40,130
average it's always above 1000 so

142
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:44,510
approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1200 note that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the y-axis</font>

143
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:48,469
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> log scale and we also see that the</font>

00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:51,260
less specifics that there is a fair

number of less specifics announced all

146
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,650
over the time right so we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slash</font>

147

148
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,469
announcements at any given time over the

149
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:06,260
three months so knowing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

150
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,630
actually people using black holing so we

151
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:10,099
also want to know how about new

152
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:14,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">announcements since this is the average</font>

153
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:17,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of per day so we also add the new</font>

154
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,040
announcements at any given time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

155
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:21,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of new announcements per</font>

156
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,380
day and<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprisingly this is like very</font>

157
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,330
spiky pattern what we can observe like

158
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,930
with very very high variance of

159
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:33,439
announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> and note the very far or</font>

160
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:35,570
the very high spike there and one would

161
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,690
usually expect that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to</font>

162
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:40,250
be an<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact also on the stable number</font>

163
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:42,200
right if we have a lot of new

164
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,789
announcements at one day we expect like

165
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,240
that the average<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of announcements</font>

166
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:50,569
over the course of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day is at least a</font>

167
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,450
bit affected<font color="#E5E5E5"> right I mean averages tend</font>

168
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:56,510
to smooth out spikes but we would expect

169
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,360
some impact but actually the point here

170
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font>

171
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,050
that we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really but this could be</font>

172
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:07,829
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very short announcement and so it does</font>

173
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:11,250
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have a effect so the duration</font>

174
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:15,239
of the announcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

175
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,730
frequency is we are responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

176
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:22,200
we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this graph is smoothed out</font>

177
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:24,779
here so however<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowing that actually</font>

178
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,790
black holing is used and that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

179
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:29,939
fair number of new announcements per day

180
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:32,360
we also want to know ok which prefixes

181
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:37,769
are actually announced for black holing

182
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:41,040
so and here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we got a bar plot and we</font>

183
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:44,370
also see again that this plot is locked

184
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,569
scale and on the x-axis we also plotted

185
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:51,570
the prefix sizes so note that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slash</font>

186
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:53,970
32like host<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aparri IP addresses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

187
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:58,459
count for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-seven percent of all</font>

188
00:09:53,970 --> 00:10:01,230
announcements so the majority is / 32

189
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:05,219
but we also see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is a fair</font>

190
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:07,230
number of / 24 2 /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 31 announcements</font>

191
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:09,720
they account for about 2 dot five

192
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:12,839
percent and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very</font>

193
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:16,140
very small number of basically nine

194
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:20,160
amount announcements less specific than

195
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:23,339
/ 24 this is a very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> number but</font>

196
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,870
surprisingly there was even one / 18

197
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">announce for black holing which is a</font>

198
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:32,820
huge huge address space i would say so

199
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:36,540
this plot basically raises a concern

200
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,899
because usually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> expend to accept or</font>

201
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:43,189
like operators as many of you guys tend

202
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:47,010
to accept prefixes up to / 24 hour

203
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:48,990
however in this case we need an

204
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,930
exception rule like if there is the

205
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:54,870
black holing IP address as next hop it

206
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,599
is very important that you accept / up

207
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,510
to / 32 announcements in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

208
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,670
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this tool efficient I gonna comment</font>

209
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,829
later on it it's a bit if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

210
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,020
the traffic we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this indeed</font>

211
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:10,459
tests some impact on the traffic

212
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:13,100
patterns so

213
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:19,700
however we know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> distribution mainly</font>

214
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:21,050
/ 32 but also / 18 we want to know for

215
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,450
how long were they actually announced

216
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:30,140
are they there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like a minute second</font>

217
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:33,890
or hour or day scale so therefore the

218
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:38,620
next plot is a bit on the active

219
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:41,030
duration so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> plot how long a</font>

220
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:46,520
announcement was present there and we

221
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:49,640
see that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore the the blue dots</font>

222
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:52,220
are the / 32 announcements and we see

223
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:55,699
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the active duration for those is</font>

224
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:58,190
rather short so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance we see that</font>

225
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,500
the highest dot at ten minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

226
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:04,640
accounts for about ten percent like a

fraction of<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero that one of all the /</font>

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 minutes but we also see very very</font>

230
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:15,530
long living<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones so since the majority</font>

231
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:18,100
is short live less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> three hours</font>

232
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:21,709
about fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent we also see some</font>

233
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:23,360
present for a longer period and in

234
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:27,620
specific the longest observed

235
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,020
announcement was 76 phase like once

236
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:35,390
announced and it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> present for such</font>

237
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:38,750
a long duration if we now at the less

238
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:42,530
specifics we see a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar pattern</font>

239
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:45,290
like the majority a short-lived but we

240
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:51,949
also see plenty of announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

241
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">lasts longer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so also the / 24 2 / 18</font>

242

group and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this cluster we can also</font>

243
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:59,959
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the some were present for about</font>

244
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,939
60 days which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> surprising</font>

00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:05,630
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> from my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perspective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:09,590
expect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> d dos attacks are rather on</font>

247
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:11,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the day scale our scale let's say three</font>

00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:21,200
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> five four or seven days so to</font>

250
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,510
dig a bit deeper in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> announcement</font>

251
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">pattern since we just have the duration</font>

252
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,930
but

253
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:27,880
we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if there's announcement</font>

254
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:30,130
for black<font color="#E5E5E5"> holing it could be the same</font>

255
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,260
prefect that it's real now several times

256
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:34,930
and in the previous<font color="#CCCCCC"> plot so we got the</font>

257
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:37,390
multiple data points for like five

258
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,890
minutes if the same prefix is announced

259
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,680
for five minutes and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

260
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:46,270
withdraw and then it's renounced again

261
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:50,620
so we just focus on the unique prefixes

262
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:53,110
so we found that 7860 for prefixes were

263
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">announced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for black holing like unique</font>

264
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:59,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">craig prefixes and most prefixes are</font>

265
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,620
basically just a noun or like the

266
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:06,100
highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers just announced one once</font>

267
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:09,040
like about ten percent and this box plot

268
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:13,450
basically presents the distribution so

269
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,459
we see on the x-axis and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s number</font>

270
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:18,700
so this is anonymous so you don't see

271
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:23,890
the real a s numbers but they represent

272
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:27,820
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> assa TI XP and this is the 50 a SS</font>

273
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:30,340

<font color="#CCCCCC">user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the 50 most heavy users of black</font>

275
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:39,370

276
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:42,400
majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the median is below 10 so</font>

10 announcements<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same prefix but</font>

instance if you focus on on cue on one

286
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:14,829
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see that just the median is</font>

287
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:24,400
like about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 and there are just a few</font>

288
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:26,530
outliers so now we know how the black

289
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,350
holing works or how the usage patterns

290
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:31,180
and how it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> used on the control plane</font>

291
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,740
but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a clue what's</font>

292
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,780
what's happening on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data plane I</font>

293
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,720
mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice to see the announcements</font>

294
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,050
on black holing but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know</font>

295
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,540
what

296
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:43,420
what's happening so therefore we did

297
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:47,410
case studies and I just present one here

298
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:50,290
so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> look a bit messy for now but</font>

299
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,569
just let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk you through the plot so</font>

300
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:57,490
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time it's not even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lock scared so</font>

301
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:59,950
linear and what we see is basically all

302
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:03,040
the traffic towards one a s this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

303
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:06,730
green solid line and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

304
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:11,410
total traffic to this a s really spikes

305
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:16,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">higher and we also see that the traffic</font>

306
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:19,180
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually goes to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a / 32 accounts</font>

307
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:23,110
for most of this traffic which is in

308
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:26,709
this case the dot dashed red line so

309
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:30,850
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / like one single IP</font>

310
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:33,160
address 0 / 32 and that it accounts for

311
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,829
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this traffic</font>

312
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,529
towards this prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> packs up tues 17</font>

313
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:41,260
gigabits per second this customer has a

314
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:44,380
capacity of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 gigabits per second and</font>

315
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,709
we see like right after the spike that

316
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:50,370
operators announced the / 32 for black

317
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:54,790
holing and we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the traffic</font>

318
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:57,160
rapidly decreases again but we note some

319
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:01,899
more things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing we see is</font>

320
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:03,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all the traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that before was</font>

321
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:05,939
sent towards the / 32 which is now

322
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:09,909
announced for black holing it's not

323
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:12,610
removed 20 first observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also</font>

324
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:15,400
see second observation that the amount

325
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,349
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is removed or that does not reach</font>

326
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,350
the custom anymore does not equal the

327
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:24,958
<font color="#CCCCCC">amount the blue line that goes into</font>

328
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:27,219
black holing so like my intuitive

329
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,340
expectation would have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I see</font>

330
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:32,380
all the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that does not go towards</font>

331
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:35,439
the / 32 should be in the black<font color="#CCCCCC"> pony</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

332
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:37,870
indeed if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think of it about it and</font>

333
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:42,960
there are two reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> why that is not</font>

334
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:46,059
the case first of all the traffic is

335
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,900
basically are a huge part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

336
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:51,370
is TCP you so if sessions break we see

337
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,950
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the total traffic</font>

338
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:59,020
mount is reduced and on the other hand

339
00:17:53,950 --> 00:18:02,140
we know that not all / 32 prefixes are

340
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,770
accepted not by all customers and so in

341
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,260
this case they continue to send traffic

342
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:14,590
towards the<font color="#CCCCCC"> four black</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> holing announced</font>

343
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:16,480
/ 32 so to really look a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper and</font>

344
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:20,050
what was basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and to</font>

345
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:24,250
really assure that in what we're looking

346
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:27,399
is not a spike regular spike and we just

347
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:31,660
plotted the effectiveness indicator and

348
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:33,850
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> port mix so we see them like the</font>

349
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,450
pores that received most of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic</font>

350
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:39,760
and we see that basically a normal

351
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:42,820
distribution before it's like the major

352
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:45,670
parties other random words I just proved

353
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:49,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">it by others and the majority</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

354
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:52,600
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to / 22 port 80 and</font>

355
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:56,260
then after when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> event starts we</font>

356
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:58,959
immediately see a very huge amount about

357
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,860
fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traffic going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

358
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,290
port 11 94 which is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> openvpn and</font>

359
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,090
of course I mean it's a DDoS attack so

360
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,280
we don't know which service was running

361
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">on this board it's not it's not</font>

362
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,330
necessarily has to do something with

363
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:17,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">openvpn but this port is assigned to it</font>

364
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:20,169
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least and we see that this amount is</font>

365
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:26,170
there and then we see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> indeed</font>

366
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:28,710
reduced over time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's converging to</font>

367
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:32,610
toward zero again and we see also the

368
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:35,290
coming daily patterns again but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

369
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,840
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we observed that this is</font>

370
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:40,120
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be useful for</font>

371
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,520
operators that indeed there are

372
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,860
significant changes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> port mixes and</font>

373
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,250
that this can be leveraged in the future

374
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:52,840
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dida's protection even more</font>

375
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:56,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">effective so let me quickly summarize we</font>

376
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:58,899
found two that 23,000 announcements of

377
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,420
black<font color="#CCCCCC"> holing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over our three month period</font>

378
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,310
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> observed so in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> black</font>

379
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,720
holing at IXPs or at least at our

380
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:09,059
vantage point

381
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:13,809
was heavily or was heavily used by about

382
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:17,080
sixty four different a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SS which is about</font>

383
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:18,730
ten percent of the customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we see</font>

384
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a stable number of</font>

385
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,580
announcements about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1200 in any given</font>

386
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:28,030
time and we observed the least specific

387
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:30,639
was a / 18 which is quite huge we also

388
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:32,408
see very diverse announcements patterns

389
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,809
in terms of freaked frequency in the

390
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">right duration we saw this on off on off</font>

391
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,418
pattern and this also indicates for us

392
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:44,229
that there is no best operational

393
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:47,380
practice so that each aasra each network

394
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,510
operator does it the way it thinks it's

395
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most meaningful for their network</font>

396
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:54,940
would we see that there's really room

397
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:58,179
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Standardization here to really you</font>

398
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:03,970
have some basic instructions for people

399
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:05,919
that are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much into it</font>

400
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:09,850
and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really help and support</font>

401
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:11,950
them and we we see in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case study</font>

402
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:15,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in fact black holing can be a tool</font>

403
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:17,289
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is as a last resort effective to</font>

404
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,230
succeed in mitigating largely dos

405
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:22,270
attacks so those were just the

406
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,610
highlights of the paper we published

407
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,559
that the passive active measurement

408
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,479
conference earlier this year so if you

409
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,908
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have all the details can be</font>

410
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:37,539
found in the paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put the link there</font>

411
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:40,690
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> remains as a future work the</font>

412
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:42,309
acceptance of the / 32 black holing

413
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">announcements is very important so</font>

414
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:48,158
that's where you guys come into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the game</font>

415
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:50,949
so you please make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you accept</font>

416
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:54,250
/ 32 announcements for black holing with

417
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,169
a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> next-hop IP address at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d</font>

418
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,110
cakes for instance that you really

419
00:21:56,169 --> 00:22:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">accept those because that helps other</font>

420
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:05,949
members so and we also think about

421
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,750
standardized triggering now I gonna

422
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:10,720
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a bit more on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

423
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,429
slide and we also think that it is

424
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,830
important for customers to have sort of

425
00:22:12,429 --> 00:22:16,960
black hole traffic monitoring one<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

426
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:18,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the on/off on/off pattern could be</font>

427
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,470
that basically you

428
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,908
don't have any mean of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

429
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:23,830
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> soon as you announce something for</font>

430
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:25,509
black hole and you just don't receive as

431
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,210
much traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have</font>

432
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:31,090
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea how much traffic is actually</font>

433
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:33,340
dropped at the I XP so one first baby

434
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:36,309
step to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> this feature at the XP</font>

435
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:38,379
would be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide a monitoring tool to</font>

436
00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:40,029
really tell you how much traffic is

437
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,130
actually dropped and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

438
00:22:40,029 --> 00:22:44,110
switch it off to to see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much is</font>

439
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:47,500
coming again<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it's too much and</font>

440
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:51,459
you switch black holing on again and as

441
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,409
the port mix showed a bit more

442
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:56,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">fine-grained black holing maybe on</font>

443
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:59,320
transport layer ports might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be something</font>

444
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:03,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">very effective and might help the</font>

445
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:05,529
community so here's some security

446
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:08,350
consideration because it's not always

447
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:10,539
all everything nice and shiny there are

448
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:13,090
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> also some things need to be</font>

449
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:14,799
considered so if you offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> black holing</font>

450
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,139
as a service to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers you</font>

451
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:20,110
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure that the route</font>

452
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:21,729
server checks whether an<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS is allowed</font>

453
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce something for black holing</font>

454
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:29,019
or not so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

455
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:31,240
important to not give another attack

456
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:34,029
vector for 4d dos attacks so the route

457
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,970
server may only accept black holing

458
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:41,440
announcements if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're legitimate owner</font>

459
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:44,799
of the IP address space so and actually

460
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the danger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> second point this</font>

461
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be the DDoS attack through black</font>

462
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,320
holing so that I use black holing as a

463
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:55,120
tool to conduct a DDoS attack yeah so

464
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:59,649
strictly filtering us the answer

465
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:02,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">according</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to RFC 745</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for and last but</font>

466
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:06,158
not least of course it's possible to

467
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:08,470
directly have a BGP session with another

468
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">customers router and just send him a lot</font>

469
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:14,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">of black holing announcements which are</font>

470
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:16,990
probably drop but still the router if

471
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:19,508
it's really weak it needs resources to

472
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:22,750
really compute if those are valid or not

473
00:24:19,509 --> 00:24:28,269
so there could be a resource extortion

474
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:30,220
attack against routers so a few words on

475
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:31,920
senators die striganov beckoning<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

476
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,230
mentioned the next hop

477
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,900
as a trigger for black holing but what

478
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:39,240
you what is quite more common in the HP

479
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,100
world and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the ISP world is that</font>

480
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,970
there's a community to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trigger black</font>

481
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:47,459
holing and in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah have really</font>

482
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,920
a standardized way to not make you

483
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,140
writing configurations at each pop your

484
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,810
present or for each appearing session

485
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,220
you have we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have like</font>

486
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,980
one well-known<font color="#CCCCCC"> well defined community</font>

487
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:02,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">and therefore we have an internet draft</font>

488
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:07,200
which is just went through the last call

489
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:09,899
and is ready to be hopefully accepted at

490
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">the IETF later this year so that we have</font>

491
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">like one well defined community which</font>

492
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,159
signals I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hole traffic</font>

493
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:19,170
towards this prefix and that it can be

494
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:22,800
and we hope it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be implemented</font>

495
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:25,050
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I XPS and by all ISPs so that we</font>

496
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:30,139
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a standardized way that</font>

497
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:32,970
should make things for you easier so

498
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:36,750
that's it from here and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really happy</font>

499
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:39,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take any questions comments not just</font>

500
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,370
here so if you too shy you can also drop

501
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:49,200
me a line I'm really happy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss</font>

502
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:50,790
anything thanks Jobe<font color="#E5E5E5"> Snyder's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTT the</font>

503
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,440
standardized<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hole community is</font>

504
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,690
something that we will support as well

505
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:56,730
and i would encourage my fellow

506
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,060
operators to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the draft</font>

507
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,250
and prepare themselves to support that

508
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,379
community going forward later this year

509
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:07,080
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting until the communities</font>

510
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:10,010
actually ratified as an RFC because then

511
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:13,230
it's like hyper official but it's coming

512
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:14,550
yeah thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the comment I didn't see</font>

513
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,160
you made it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up first so we'll go to the</font>

515
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:22,500
conversin I was wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've seen</font>

516
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,140
any traffic patterns<font color="#CCCCCC"> where in a customer</font>

517
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,750
announcing the / 32 black hole route

518
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,000
actually attracts more traffic from

519
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,400
other customers since that more specific

520
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,740
route<font color="#E5E5E5"> could override policies that would</font>

521
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,170
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traffic elsewhere on a</font>

522
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:40,020
different path to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network yeah yeah</font>

523
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's right so no we didn't see that</font>

524
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:44,039
but

525
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,230
in most cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the cases I've</font>

526
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:49,080
looked into it's the case that they

527
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:52,559
really split the prefixes and have like

528
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:55,439
different announcements but for sure for

529
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,510
/ 32 that's not possible since 44

530
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,200
regular announcements it's just a down

531
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:05,059
to / 24 so yeah that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case</font>

532
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,620
but in practice I have no observed that

533
00:27:05,059 --> 00:27:10,470
Nico<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMO it to your point but also</font>

534
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:13,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">Seattle internet exchange we're looking</font>

535
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:16,919
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> similar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the six but</font>

536
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:19,710
first instead of having traffic drop at

537
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:24,090
the six I think our preference is to

538
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:25,710
facilitate members accepting black hole

539
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:27,120
routes and just passing us through if

540
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,580
you have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all your members and</font>

541
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,770
say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept your statutory tues why</font>

542
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,500
not use the route server to translate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

543
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,809
the individual peers black hole

544
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:39,809
communities internally rather than drop

545
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:42,690
it at the exchange so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be dropped</font>

546
00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:45,360
further upstream at those providers yeah

547
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:48,690
but would like I mean that the issue

548
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:51,689
here is like we as an XP operator don't

549
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:54,659
feel like really touching any traffic so

550
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the most neutral way to do</font>

551
00:27:54,659 --> 00:28:00,510
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the route server and to</font>

552
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:03,299
redistribute it and hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that customers</font>

553
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:06,419
accepted I mean at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

554
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:09,090
it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP it's an Internet routing</font>

555
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:12,029
and I don't have the mean to force

556
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:15,860
someone to accept something I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

557
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:15,860
encourage them to do so

558
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:30,889
any last questions okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> crystal yeah</font>

559
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:30,889
thank you
