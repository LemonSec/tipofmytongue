1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,490
wait I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> invite two of the three</font>

2
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:14,829
winners<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our hackathon so we hit a tie</font>

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:16,750
for second place and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:19,570
both both of the teams that tied for

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,830
second with 15 votes present today I'd

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,010
like both of them to come up to the

7
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:27,788
stage and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> tomorrow we'll have the</font>

8
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:30,630
first place hack presenting in the

9
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:30,630
plenary session

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:42,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and first I'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> invite</font>

11
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,109
John<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kristoff representing team black</font>

12
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:48,070
hole route monitor to give us an

13
00:00:44,109 --> 00:00:50,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">overview of his hack thanks Sean so I</font>

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,729
should first say one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our teammates</font>

15
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,839
created a presentation yesterday which

16
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:54,430
I've messed up because they use a

17
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:56,530
different application so I had to kind

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:58,420
of recreate that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully I</font>

19
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,369
captured the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the highlights of that but</font>

20
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,260
we we had perhaps a nicer looking one

21
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,909
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm showing you today but so there</font>

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,990
was an idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had for the the hack</font>

23
00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:09,970
yesterday involved something that

24
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,949
derived from a research paper that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font>

25
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,569
read a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks ago where some</font>

26
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,970
researchers were trying to study

27
00:01:13,569 --> 00:01:17,560
patterns a behavior for black hole

28
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:18,580
routes at a few internet exchanges and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

29
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,880
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that well that was interesting</font>

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,740
wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be nice if we could examine</font>

31
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">black hole routes from not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just in</font>

32
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:28,390
exchange providers but from all ESPYs

33
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,069
who provide some interface via looking

34
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,720
glass or a route server and could we do

35
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,690
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that data if nothing more</font>

36
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,119
than just some sort of feed or view of

37
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,640
black hole routes sort of being

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,810
announced throughout the world at places

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:45,970
and points all over so my present<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

40
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,229
and a handful of people seemed

41
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,280
interesting that for one reason or

42
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,479
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,550
reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was and so we came</font>

44
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,940
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and started hacking away on</font>

45
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:57,369
this so that was our initial plan was to

46
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,530
first go around and find where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could</font>

47
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,209
get these black hole routes from so some

48
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,149
some places you can get them be

49
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:06,879
examining next hops other places you can

50
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:08,709
examine community tags and so I

51
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:11,530
initially thought we would be doing a

52
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:14,349
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of screen scraping and parsing very</font>

53
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:16,480
unique and distinct interfaces and then

54
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,369
pulling that data out and putting in

55
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,950
some database and then doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

56
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,450
with it building tools and so forth it

57
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,890
seemed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little complicated a</font>

58
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,659
little bit hacky to try to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

59
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,220
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hackathon so I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

60
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:32,260
a good place to undertake that effort we

61
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,930
I'll skip over a few slides because we

62
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,159
have a few but we had when team member

63
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,930
who might say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit of a</font>

64
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,450
ringer who came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it to us with a</font>

65
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:43,890
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they literally had helped</font>

66
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,149
develop a woman from kada

67
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,010
must have found this idea intriguing

68
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,050
because there was some synergy between

69
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:52,810
the tool that she had worked on<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

70
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:54,790
be Jimmy stream and the idea that we had

71
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,050
of pulling why call routes out of GDP

72
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:01,390
data so this in fact ultimately was

73
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,860
going to save us a tremendous amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

74
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,380
time because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this provided us an</font>

75
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,750
interface into routing data that kada

76
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:09,460
collects and aggravates for multiple

77
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,800
places including ripe and route views

78
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:13,840
and some other places<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that allowed</font>

79
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,450
us to literally just build very short

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,540
pieces of code that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would tie in pulling</font>

81
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:22,119
out information based on again either

82
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,160
community tag or a next-hop address and

83
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,780
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> just showing you some sample code</font>

84
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,670
literally there was not much more to

85
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:29,770
some Python code than what you see on

86
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> screen there so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that seems a</font>

87
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,790
tremendous amount of effort and it was

88
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:36,130
almost like we were partially done for a

89
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,470
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that back-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work so that was</font>

90
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:39,670
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool so we once we started</font>

91
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,290
collecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we started putting it</font>

92
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,780
into database we built a simple schema

93
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,130
that just simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a tag of where this</font>

94
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,370
data came from whether it came from

95
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,709
addie<font color="#CCCCCC"> kicks or a level 3 or whoever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,180
timestamp the origin ASR the actual

97
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:53,980
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was announced as a black</font>

98
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,390
hole and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we could do things with</font>

99
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data then we can create</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> text-based</font>

100
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:00,970
feeds and top<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 reports built to a web</font>

101
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:03,190
interface and a couple of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

102
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:05,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">team we're thinking of using this data</font>

103
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:07,359
not so much just<font color="#CCCCCC"> as sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of insight and</font>

104
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,910
as a curiosity but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build something</font>

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they could use on behalf of their</font>

106
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:15,100
customers when a customer calls them

107
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,479
about questions whether the website is

108
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,730
down or why they can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to something</font>

109
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:21,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">or why traffic is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being delivered to</font>

110
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,780
them so most likely many of you heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

111
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,229
The Who am I command on<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNIX and so we</font>

112
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,489
came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a am i dead command for our</font>

113
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,040
black hole route server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

114
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,240
check if to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> something is actually</font>

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">being black hold somewhere the internet</font>

116
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,880
or not so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this nice cool fancy</font>

117
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,950
logo that has the spinning wheel of

118
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,210
death just<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

119
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,800
make some<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out but just a quick</font>

120
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:45,099
screenshot of like what the database

121
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,570
looks like this doesn't come off very

122
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,220
well the fonts real strong but here's

123
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,900
some top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 reports that we were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

124
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,870
there was a web interface and I think

125
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,130
this still might be accessible I don't

126
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,169
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much data is actually in there</font>

127
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,760
but you can you can try the<font color="#E5E5E5"> link on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

128
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:58,740
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

129
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,680
at up for at least the next couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

130
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,660
days or so so that's kind of what we

131
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,430
came up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not fully done but</font>

132
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,690
it was something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we felt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'd made</font>

133
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,810
some progress on and hopefully you'll

134
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:12,000
see some more of this from me and

135
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,550
perhaps the rest of the team so if you

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,290
have any questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you can come</font>

137
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,000
fighter or I'll point you in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rec</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">shin of one of our team members down if</font>

139

you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how to make</font>

140
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:27,080
use of this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you great</font>

141
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,080
thank you
