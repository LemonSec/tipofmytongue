seeing a Terran and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that we have</font>

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:20,448
depleted our available pool of ipv4

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,419
address space this happened in<font color="#E5E5E5"> September</font>

7
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:26,150
of 2015 so we're no longer issuing ipv4

8
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:30,169
address space for two requesters and a

9
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:33,079
general basis so current trends

10
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:35,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">observations people are still</font>

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,130
desperately seeking ipv4 the need is

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:39,230
still great we see this every day we get

13
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,630
questions and calls and we still get

14
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,269
requests although v4 requests have

15
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:47,210
dropped a bit we're still seeing

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:49,430
activity there most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the activity is</font>

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,750
based in the transfers and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a transfer</font>

00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,250

00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,990
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who come in to request</font>

21
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,090
ipv4 they don't realize we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have it</font>

22
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:04,939
any longer they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an option to be put</font>

23
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,409
on this waiting list and hope that some

24
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:09,798
space will come back at some point in

25
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,749
time we also were seen a lot of

26
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre-approvals being requested and that</font>

27
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:16,969
is in preparation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a market-based</font>

00:01:21,469 --> 00:01:24,798
allows<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the market and</font>

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,479
pre-approved and ready to conduct the

34
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:32,960
transfer very quickly once they find

35
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:35,149
their space and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> our transfer</font>

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,249
listing service has seen some increased

37
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:38,929
activity that's people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who need space</font>

38
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:41,270
and people who buy space can list

39
00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:42,530
themselves and then facilitators can

40
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,298
sort of help them with their

41
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:49,759
transactions and those are typically the

42
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:51,319
ipv4 market brokers these people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about are basically using</font>

44
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:55,009
space looking for ipv4 address space to

45
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:56,560
use in their networks they're still

46
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,389
growing their business with before

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">whereas this next category these people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">increase in hijackings at the registry</font>

52
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:12,799
and in attempted hijackings and much of

53
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:14,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">the activities involving the legacy</font>

54
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,830
space and that's a space that's pretty

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,730
much dormant much of it hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

56
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,020
dated in years since the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 90s even so</font>

57
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,109
that's what the hijacker is typically

58
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,120
target I have some other slides on

59
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,430
hijackings but just for some numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

60
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
some comparison we've had about 25

61
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,910
hijackings reported or discovered by

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,160
staff since September and that's when we

63
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:40,260
depleted our free pool and this was both

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,480
successful hijackings they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> took</font>

65
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,010
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> took over the record and attempted</font>

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,220
hijackings where staff was able to

67
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:49,380
intervene but in in contrast in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

68
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,330
previous 10 years we only had about 50

69
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,100
verifiable hijackings in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 year</font>

70
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,440
period so we're definitely seeing an

71
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,269
increase we expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to continue so</font>

72
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,070
we're always on our alert you know we

73
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,720
know the red flags and we're well

74
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,790
prepared for it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it still could</font>

75
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,160
happen the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we're</font>

76
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,840
finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> now after the fact is there's</font>

77
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,530
some there was some fraud rings

78
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,780
basically people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who set up shell</font>

79
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies in order to hoard ipv4 address</font>

80
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,130
space and for spamming for<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling even</font>

81
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,990
for using in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their network some of them</font>

82
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,150
but these this was done just prior to

83
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,709
depletion and we found a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them at</font>

84
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> careful</font>

85
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,890
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> not allowing people to hoard</font>

86
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,170
address space but some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them did get</font>

87
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,420
by us and this particular fraud ring

88
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,070
that I that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about set up 30</font>

89
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,540
different shell companies and got space

90
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:37,680
under each one of them and they were

91
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,100
good I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> they got by us them and so</font>

92
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,500
what kind of behavior are we seeing

93
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:45,720
directly related to hijackings just to

94
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,450
clarify it hijacking and from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> errand</font>

95
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,190
perspective is unauthorized changes that

96
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,488
are made to the database records in

97
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,290
order to gain control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of IP resources so</font>

98
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:57,090
it's someone pretending to be that

99
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,910
registrant in order to control that

100
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,830
record so what they do typically is they

101
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:04,620
find the dormant registration records

102
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,110
and who is typically the legacy the ones

103
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,820
that haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been updated in years they</font>

104
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,130
check for routing to see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's router</font>

105
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,440
or not and then they'll go further and

106
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:16,019
they'll reregister expired domain names

107
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,930
we see that quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> often they also</font>

108
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,858
reregistered defunct business names and

109
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,740
then they go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a series of</font>

110
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,960
registration record modifications at the

111
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,419
registry with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron pretending to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,010
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> registrant and that typically</font>

113
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,330
starts with what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> call an ordered</font>

114
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,740
recovery they try to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

115
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,449
the organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> records so that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

116
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:37,470
can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other incremental changes</font>

117
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,150
and ultimately their goal seems to be to

118
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,039
sell the IP addresses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer them</font>

119
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:45,270
to another organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> now that the</font>

120
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,530
market is so right the other thing we

121
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,180
hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot to</font>

122
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">do with but people report this to us</font>

123
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,810
quite often is there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

124
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:53,639
hijackings and we've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> this from law</font>

125
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,229
enforcement agencies and from other you

126
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:58,259
know external sources that tell us this

127
00:04:55,229 --> 00:05:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">is very common</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the hijackers are</font>

128
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:02,879
bringing forged Aloise letters of

129
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:08,580
authority to isps to get them to route

130
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:11,370
the space so this looks at hijacking

131
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:13,469
targets on specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin issued</font>

132
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,569
networks versus legacy networks and even

133
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:17,849
more specific we're looking at those

134
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:20,550
networks that have validated points of

135
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:23,180
contact so a validated point of contact

136
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,879
has either responded to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron's annual</font>

137
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,990
point of contact validation email or

138
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:30,120
updated their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of contact</font>

139
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,550
record which updates the last updated

140
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,949
date and who is the annual POC

141
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:38,400
validation is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy every registered</font>

142
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:41,219
user in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin's database gets the mail</font>

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,409
and gets us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> update their record they</font>

144
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:45,240
either click on a link or they tell they

145
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:47,099
say correct and then Aaron staff will

146
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,199

147
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:51,240
that within 60 days they get marked

publicly as not<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whois</font>

that they love that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of stuff on the</font>

of them have at least one validated

don't when you look on the right at the

156
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:12,960
legacy networks there's thirty thousand

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,669
actually a fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> decent number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

161
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,650

00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:29,219
that blue darker blue space is is the

165
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:32,250
target that's what hijackers are looking

166
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:34,710
for and when we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looked at how</font>

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,740
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual / 24 s are contained within</font>

00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,669
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> three hundred and forty-six</font>

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,040
thousand / 24 so it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money in</font>

171
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:47,049
today's market and it

172
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,050
definitely attractive to two hijackers

173
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:52,310
so we do get asked what can we do to

174
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,110
protect our whois data and obviously the

175
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,820
if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> registration record</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

176
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">erin's who is the best thing to do is</font>

177
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,750
come in update it make sure it's

178
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:01,850
accurate periodically look at it do

179
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,010
something to update<font color="#CCCCCC"> that last updated</font>

180
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,780
date because the hijackers<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't look</font>

181
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,330
you know when you've updated something

182
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,250
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another way is to</font>

183
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">respond to the annual POC validation</font>

184
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:16,790

185
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:19,489
correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you click on a link and say</font>

186
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,110
okay this is good or you say correct and

187
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron staff will do it for you or you</font>

188
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,330
just go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> three earn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online account you</font>

189
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:31,250
update your record and that's the policy

190
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:33,979
right there so I'm as far as request

191
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,950
activity as i mentioned ipv4 free pool

192
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,100
tickets have decreased quite drastically

193
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,930
and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the increases around the pre</font>

194
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,030
approvals and those specified recipient

195
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:46,730
transfers those market-based transfers

196
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,500
within the region we're also seeing more

197
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,950
activity in this change of authority

198
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,960
requests again that would be merger and

199
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,390
acquisition transfers they market-based

200
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,250
specified recipient transfers and those

201
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,289
org recoveries and typically those are

202
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,420
all done in incremental steps because a

203
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:03,860
lot of times its legacy<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations</font>

204
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,510
who haven't updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> their our records in</font>

205
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,070
years so they first have to make sure

206
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the organization they have control</font>

207
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">over the organization then they actually</font>

208
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:13,310
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do in MA if there has been</font>

209
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,990
merger activity and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure the</font>

210
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,630
registration record gets into the

211
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,770
correct organization name and then they

212
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:23,930
can do their specified recipient

213
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:26,120
transfer as far as v6<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests go not a</font>

214
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:27,800
lot happening there we have some steady

215
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,600
ticket traffic we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expected</font>

216
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">more of an increase</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with before</font>

217
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,409
depletion but it's really just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

218
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,549
happening at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

219
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:39,919
sure it will so before requests not a

220
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,348
lot to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> um we depleted in September</font>

221
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,780
of 2015 and it's been steadily going

222
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:50,180
down since then we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting less than</font>

223
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:51,650
150 requests per month the waiting list

224
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">has grown because there's no other</font>

225
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,579
option<font color="#CCCCCC"> so a lot of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

226
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,710
requesting asked to be added to the

waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

228
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:00,130
many of them don't they just go away<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

229
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,200
they go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transfer market and try</font>

230
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">to find space elsewhere but some of them</font>

231
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,910
are opting to wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in case space</font>

232
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:11,800
will come back there are three kinds of

233
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,839
transfers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been throwing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out Trent</font>

234
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,010
various names and transfers stuff but I

235
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,920
didn't tell you what they actually were

236
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,560
so M&A is the traditional transfer it's

237
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,140
based on a change in business structure

238
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,550
includes company reorganizations and it

239
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,730
is supported by legal documentation

240
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,770
staff<font color="#CCCCCC"> will ask for legal docs before we</font>

241
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,670
can actually make that transaction

242
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,829
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> at end in the database transfers</font>

243
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:37,959
to specified recipients are those ipv4

244
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:39,790
market transfers they're based on

245
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,310
financial transactions between two

246
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:44,410
parties they are supported by justified

247
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,680
need you must meet an errand policy in

248
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,600
order to transact that that transfer and

249
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,250
that happens within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the region and then</font>

250
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,110
there's a similar policy called in

251
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:55,420
Terraria<font color="#E5E5E5"> are transfers to specify the</font>

252
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,220
recipients and those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the same type</font>

253
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,319
of market transfers based on financial

254
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,780
transactions and they occur outside of

255
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,090
the region so they can go from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin to</font>

256
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,520
one of the registries that has inner<font color="#CCCCCC"> rer</font>

257
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:12,670
transfer policies right now that's ripe

258
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:14,650
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> AP Nick so this is where all the</font>

259
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,469
activity is as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where all</font>

260
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:19,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">those old ipv4 requests used to be</font>

261
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:23,710
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> they've all come to us in the</font>

262
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:26,020
form of 8.3 transfers last year in May

263
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:28,930
we completed what does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little</font>

264
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,960
under 10 maybe 9 and in April we

265
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:36,189
completed 92 of them so it's definitely

266
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:39,010
growing and it will continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and this</font>

267
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,140
looks at the total completions we

268
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,020
thought this was interesting the policy

269
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:47,430
was enacted in 2011 and we only had

270
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:50,650
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 completed transfers in 2011</font>

271
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,390
2015 we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> over 200 and just in the</font>

272
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,840
first four months of this year we've

273
00:10:52,390 --> 00:11:01,330
completed over 250 so we expect that

274
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:03,340
trend to keep going up and up these<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

275
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,800
requests as I said not a lot happening

276
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,590
it's pretty steady we had a little blip

277
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,150
in September when we ran out of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv4</font>

278
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,280
free pool we had some peep

279
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:17,560
coming in showing interest and then it

280
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:20,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">just leveled off again this looks at the</font>

281
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">ISP members who have come into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron to</font>

282
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:26,079
get their ipv6 allocations right now at

283
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,600
the end of q1 we had about fifty percent

284
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:30,460
of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spew members who have come in</font>

285
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,740
and got in their allocations when we

286
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,990
first started<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking this back in 2010</font>

287
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,240
only about twenty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the resp</font>

288
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,580
members had gotten their v6 allocations

289
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:45,820
so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some progress being</font>

290
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:48,850
made slowly and then this looks at those

291
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:51,190
same ISPs based on their size so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

292
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,500
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> extra extra small on the left to</font>

293
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,450
extra extra large on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right and what</font>

294
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,610
we see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the big guys the extra</font>

295
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,140
the larger you are the more likely it is

296
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,170
that you've come in to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get your ipv6</font>

297
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,360
allocation from Aaron and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know are</font>

298
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,979
working on transitioning when the

299
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,320
smaller you are the less likely you are

300
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:10,990
because only about twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the</font>

301
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:17,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">really small guys have even gotten have</font>

302
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:25,750
gotten every 6 allocations so that is

303
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:27,430
all I have are there any questions I'll

304
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:31,600
go to the back Mike I guess cuz you were

305
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:33,880
there first nope Chris speier's I want

306
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,370
it on the hijacking first great

307
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,380
information thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you on the hijacking</font>

308
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,940
front you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I actually have a</font>

309
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:43,900
customer base that it's mostly<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy</font>

310
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,940
users so or that's something that I look

311
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,520
at regularly with that report and it

312
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,020
really did parse that data and compared

313
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,400
to your own routing tables but the

314
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:53,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is it's now folks in this room</font>

315
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:56,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have that space it's might not even</font>

316
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,000
be your direct customers so it's how do

317
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,470
we get those folks to update their data

318
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,700
because even when I can and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

319
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,090
closer relationship with my customer

320
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">base the recidivism rate is really high</font>

321
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:08,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">because two years from now it'll be</font>

322
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:12,640
unvalidated and it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one person at</font>

323
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,689
that organization so is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any way</font>

324
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,410
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really deal with this</font>

325
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,240
problem it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and we've</font>

326
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,160
been thinking about it ourselves but we

327
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,900
have to we have to try to get the word

328
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,390
out I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing</font>

329
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,120
more

330
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:27,740
work in this area if you have any

331
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,100
suggestion to yourself i'd love to hear

332
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,480
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the legacy space</font>

333
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,370
holders are sort of in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> academic</font>

334
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,020
realm and I think maybe if we start

335
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,270
reaching out to them that might help

336
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:40,160
maybe go to some of their there you know

337
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,630
conferences and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this we</font>

338
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,430
haven't talked about it a lot I did a

339
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,980
hijacking presentation probably 12 years

340
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:50,390
ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the last time so i think it's</font>

341
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:52,160
worth continuing yeah if you can have

342
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,810
someone talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> educause or</font>

343
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those groups those are great</font>

344
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:57,709
places anyone that's involved with dot

345
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,339
edu right yep<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's a good idea</font>

346

thank you Matt Thank You Leslie<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt</font>

347
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">PTAC yahoo could you clarify one point</font>

348
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,800
for me speaking of hijacking you

349
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:12,230
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your stats are including</font>

350
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,260
unsuccessful and successful hijackings

351
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,620
so if you know it's a successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> hi jack</font>

352
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:21,680
I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the right person</font>

353
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:23,240
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin allow those to go through well</font>

354
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,459
they've already gone through that's the

355
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,530
problem but what we do do is we actually

356
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,020
reclaim space when we know there's an

357
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:32,060
actual hijacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wheelock records so</font>

358
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:33,860
that no<font color="#E5E5E5"> further you know they can't make</font>

359
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,750
any further updates to the record even

360
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,640
an attempted ones will rock luck all

361
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,740
records until we're done doing our full

362
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:41,689
research but yes we do Reclamation's of

363
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,730
space that's been hijacked so they

364
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,610
ultimately would be unsuccessful<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

365
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">term they're just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> short term successful</font>

366
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,180
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay okay I just make it sound</font>

367
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,730
a little bit like you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> away with it</font>

368
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">kale I neck no no we don't let that go</font>

369
00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:00,640
absolutely Marshall thank you ok you're

370
00:14:54,650 --> 00:15:03,439
welcome Tony Tony to Tony Taylor comcast

371
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,630
thanks for the presentation a couple of

372
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">things come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to mind but you know with</font>

373
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:11,689
the expiration of who is data or you

374
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:13,520
mark it what no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer valid I mean so</font>

375
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:15,650
publishing right not valid<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would</font>

376
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,290
be good to see maybe a similar approach

377
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:20,540
taken with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our our data obviously you</font>

378
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:23,569
guys have your own I are other IRS exist

379
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:27,319
many complaints over time of stale data

380
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:30,050
so i think expert would be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

381
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:32,780
so you're saying in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ir</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are young</font>

382
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:36,160
that's an interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> point look at the</font>

383
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,500
registry also yes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess any</font>

384
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,959
associated wreck

385
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:41,400
so if like the whois record that

386
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,410
registered in the first place just

387
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,900
obviously wipe all those up you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font>

388
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:48,719
that's one piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's one idea and</font>

389
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:50,790
then another is with the LOA<font color="#E5E5E5"> is yeah the</font>

390
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,180
forgery thing I mean there's no standard

391
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,670
for what what comprises an loa I mean

392
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's all this like a nasty mess and I</font>

393
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,240
guess probably you guys have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

394
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,610
thing I mean you you request legal

395
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,070
documents from people I don't know what

396
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:10,440
what how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how do you verify those</font>

397
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:12,390
um we do independent research and we try

398
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,950
to get external verification yeah it's

399
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,780
gonna say this should be published<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

400
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,670
and somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just yes mostly yes</font>

401
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,920
registry of deeds we have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

402
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work that's good so but</font>

403
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">the LOA thing I mean I think we've</font>

404
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:26,130
probably it you know may well affect

405
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,930
everybody here I mean all service

406
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:30,000
providers like people somebody comes to

407
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,760
you with a PDF I mean you have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

408
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">what right exactly you know how good</font>

409
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,790
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we got to do</font>

410
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:39,240
something better in that world in it

411
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:41,280
like to any anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's got some ideas</font>

412
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,170
or interest come and talk to me great

413
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,730
thanks Tony mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oscars errant so one of</font>

414
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:49,800
the things I've actually heard from a

415
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,600
couple of people now is we like to have

416
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,719
some standards based on these other ways

417
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,280
so in its really this is a

418
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,650
community-based sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs</font>

419
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be built up and it reminds me I used</font>

420
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to work for verisign many years ago and</font>

421
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,349
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that they had there so</font>

422
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,139
there's a race to the bottom for<font color="#E5E5E5"> CAS and</font>

423
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:09,569
validating certs and the that all the

424
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,040
CAS realize that so one of the things

425
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,459
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did is they came up with a</font>

426
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,889
consortium with a way of standardizing

427
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,140
extended validate its validation where

428
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:21,449
you actually had this process you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to</font>

429
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow through and everybody who is a</font>

430
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,620
part of that consortium followed that

431
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:27,410
process they signed a document saying

432
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,209
here are the steps we need to take and

433
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,150
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they do those steps is very</font>

434
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar and how Aaron does its vetting</font>

435
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,860
and many organizations when they bet

436
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,720
those other ways so we just need I think

437
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">there needs to be a point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where people</font>

438
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,060
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's write this down and</font>

439
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:47,800
it's all agree to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can I go to the</font>

440
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:52,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">right Mike with Sandy</font>

442
00:17:52,420 --> 00:18:00,850
Parsons I had a boat loaded questions

443
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:04,150
I'll yield to someone else if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

444
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:06,610
gotten too far your discussion about the

445
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,280
fraud ring setting up shell corporations

446
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:12,850
to get lots of address space you said

447
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:16,240
they were hoarding it are you suggesting

448
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had a need themselves and so</font>

449
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,950
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did all this or that they were</font>

450
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:24,520
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> together a pot that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they had</font>

intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell we've seen both we've</font>

452
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,450
heard and seen both so if someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

453
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,879
gotten address space fraudulently you

454
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:39,850
reclaim it<font color="#E5E5E5"> REE well have you seen it</font>

455
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:42,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing what what do you do about space</font>

456
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,500
that is we done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we can't do anything</font>

457
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,200
about that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> propria</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

458
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,730
area of<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsibility is that the</font>

459
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,170
database and that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I clarified what</font>

460
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,580
hijacking is from an heir own

461
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,190
perspective the only thing we can do

462
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,230
anything about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when it's done in our</font>

463
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,690
database or in violation of our contract

464
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,220
so route hijackings we unfortunately

465
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,840
don't get involved in we know a little

466
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit about them but we don't get we can't</font>

467
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:12,310
do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chart that you had</font>

00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:52,029
the entries in your database at risk if

481
00:19:49,089 --> 00:19:54,729
it's information that you were able to

482
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:56,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public or at least to some group</font>

483
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:58,839
for monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who I</font>

484
00:19:56,439 --> 00:20:01,119
met this week at the hackathon who might

485
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,019
be interested in route monitoring who

486
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,349
may be able to help with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of that</font>

487
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:07,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and to this I'd be interested to</font>

488

know I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just answered the</font>

489
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:12,069
question the hijacks that you discovered

490
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:15,309
are simply based on database changes of

491
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:17,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the craft yes correct I'm also a part of</font>

492
00:20:15,309 --> 00:20:19,899
a group called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wren I sec which is kind</font>

494
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:24,639
okay with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is i can</font>

495
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:25,979
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this issue to that group it's a</font>

security umbrella group for higher

497

educated in this room fantastic that

498
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:39,549
would be great thank you my own Michael

499
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:42,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">no go Mike it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not true yes net um I'm</font>

500
00:20:39,549 --> 00:20:46,199
I want to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph where</font>

501
00:20:42,729 --> 00:20:48,729
there was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bars yeah that one</font>

502
00:20:46,199 --> 00:20:51,039
because and I should know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this because I</font>

503
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:53,979
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on this but it wasn't it</font>

504
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,199
the case that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you've got a if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

505
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:58,959
an ISP your minimum allocation in ipv6

506
00:20:56,199 --> 00:21:00,759
was / 32 which automatically made you

507
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:03,309
either small or medium at that point so

508
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">you couldn't actually be extra</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller</font>

509
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:09,279
extra extra slaw and have ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all</font>

510
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:12,458
back then until recently right xx-small

511
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:16,299
is having less than a / 22 of you four

512
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:19,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">are less than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a / 40 of b6 and you're</font>

513
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:22,179
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs don't get / 40 so right so I</font>

514
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:24,579
they might be starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to trend upward</font>

515
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,589
because they have made micro allocations

516
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:28,178
available for ipv6 now right you're

517
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:29,408
right that would be part of the reason

518
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:33,779
you're seeing that's cute good point

519
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:38,169
thank you um Joe Joe provoke Google

520
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:42,969
thanks for all the numbers I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

521
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:47,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">it that way but yeah in terms of the</font>

522
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:50,019
reclaimed space I know you've been

523
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:51,188
marching entries in the database when

524
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:53,549
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expire and so on so</font>

525
00:21:51,189 --> 00:21:55,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">forth is there a feed</font>

526
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,408
currently or one that could be published

527
00:21:55,649 --> 00:22:00,748
for those revocations so that perhaps

528
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:01,889
people that may care about monitoring

529
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:05,909
whether or not they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the routing</font>

530
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:07,619
system could do so automatically I we

531
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:09,809
don't do that currently if you would

532
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to fill out a suggestion that's our</font>

process for getting community and put

534

535
00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:17,989
advise you to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then we can</font>

00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:02,850
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for all all removals</font>

552
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,799
like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an administrative action</font>

553
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,230
removal being called out that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct</font>

554
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,989
oh yeah that's that's what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking</font>

555
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,149
might be more useful to jdk his comment

558
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:24,238
have the question about the space that

559
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:26,730
you had revoked for lack of a better

rpki was suggested I believe correct me

564
00:23:38,999 --> 00:23:43,710
if I'm wrong one of the main issues with

565
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:47,369
that is for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> legacy holders that have</font>
