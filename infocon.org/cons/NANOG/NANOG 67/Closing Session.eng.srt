put together<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nanog meaning and I could</font>

not do this on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> behalf and they make</font>

contributors are here on this slide and

32
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:51,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the difference between this slide in the</font>

33
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,780
previous is that the previous sponsors

the premium sponsors are here for the

whole three meeting series and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

folks that are signed up just to help

participation as well nano<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists 67</font>

stats it's always my opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

41
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:20,720
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of highlight about the folks</font>

42
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:24,649
that were here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the meeting and I have</font>

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,430
little data it it's not something I've

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,800
typed up but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how Chicago</font>

45
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,200
compared to San Diego and how it

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,750
compared to last June and so I looked at

47
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,869
look back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for a little trending</font>

48
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,000
data and we find that being back in

49
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,930
Chicago is a little lighter in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,690
attendance overall in February last year

51
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:51,470
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty or excuse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me yes februari in</font>

52
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:54,739
San Diego we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,100 individuals and a</font>

53
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:58,790
year ago in June we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,200 over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1,200</font>

54
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:01,370
so little smaller meeting roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

55
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:04,070
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time of the year so gives you an</font>

56
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,130
indication of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local flavor or</font>

57
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:10,000
registration I think there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

58
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,130
meetings in in Chicago that<font color="#CCCCCC"> may have</font>

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,590
contributed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that recently but in any</font>

60
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,170
case it is what it is member

61
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,260
registration it's interesting i always

62
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:24,500
like to see how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our attendees at</font>

63
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,269
a given meeting our members and it's

64
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:29,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty consistent about twenty four</font>

65
00:03:26,269 --> 00:03:31,790
percent so Thank You<font color="#E5E5E5"> members for coming</font>

66
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:35,269
to the net on meetings student

67
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:38,660
registration over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> San</font>

68
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:41,450
Diego and last June it's about the same

69
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:43,280
a little less<font color="#E5E5E5"> than it was in February</font>

70
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,108
and I suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

71
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the college immersion program we had a</font>

72
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:51,650
few more participants<font color="#E5E5E5"> in February than</font>

73
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,970
we have here in Chicago the number of

74
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:55,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">females which i think is</font>

75
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,520
really interesting as well and this is

76
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:01,880
as reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your registration form</font>

77
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:04,310
it's a good note in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our trend is up</font>

78
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,230
from eight percent a year ago nine

79
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:10,370
percent in February and eleven percent

80
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:13,040
of our attendance the countries

81
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:18,709
represented it any one given nanog

82
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,690
meeting is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 27 26 so</font>

83
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,880
just a highlight of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what makes up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana I</font>

84
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the next slide is also interesting</font>

85
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,340
because I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

86
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:30,140
our core area of participation so rather

87
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">than give you a bunch of numbers I</font>

88
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,000
thought it a nice pie chart would be

89
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,460
good to show you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it indicates that</font>

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,620
we're pretty consistent in what I've

91
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:43,539
reported over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> years in terms of as</font>

92
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:48,980
you report your area of<font color="#E5E5E5"> representation</font>

95
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,090
the attendees there would be no Nana so

96
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,220
while the conversation is both positive

97
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:01,940
and negative at times<font color="#CCCCCC"> and controversial</font>

98
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:04,220

about participating as a board member

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,150
addressed in the bylaws this is the time

130
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:40,060
to start thinking about it as we lead

131
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:43,179
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> October meeting where we</font>

actually vote as members the election

133
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:50,080
process is open to everyone so the

134
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,780
conversation is nano eccentric but the

135
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,300
actual voting is to members only if

halfway back and it's a smaller group so

184
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:15,760
you get a chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

185
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:19,120
can converse a little more with the

speakers so even if you come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font>

187
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,780
meetings if we're nearby we'd love to

00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,560
have you at nanog on the road and

189
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:28,449
certainly the way we get keep growing

190
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,699
that attendance is by passing it along

191
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:33,670
so if you can pass it on to your

192
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:36,460
colleagues your operations directors and

193
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:38,469
managers and provisioning folks and so

194
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,690
on we'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get them involved in</font>

195
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:43,330
nanog keep them in the networking

196
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,940

197

we're opening a call for presentations

202
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,380
for nanog 68 we've already got some

203
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:06,160
ideas for content we've talked to people

204

here you're welcome to catch me<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

205
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,650
this presentation if you have any

206
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions about that you when you submit</font>

207
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,660
a presentation you'll be assigned a PC

208
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,790
Shepherd and that Shepherd helps you

209
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,949
with the submission process they can

210
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:23,620
also help<font color="#CCCCCC"> you with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the content so we are</font>

211
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,700
an operator forum we encourage operators

212
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,920
to speak we want to hear your

213
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:28,570
experiences some of you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be</font>

214
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,540
experienced speakers

215
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,240
you may not feel comfortable entirely

216
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,670
about your content will help you will

217
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,770
make you confident there are slide decks

218
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,520
that had seven revisions before they're

219
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:44,020
presented here and I didn't see a single

220
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,780
presentation here that wasn't worthy of

221
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:50,260
being on the program so if you submit

222
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:53,339
something will work with you try to make

223
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:57,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure we can get you on the program as</font>

224
00:10:53,340 --> 00:11:00,940
Betty said keep note of when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotel</font>

225
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:03,010
block closes but also make your

226
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,300
reservation in advance if you think

227
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,939
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the meeting in Dallas</font>

228
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">reserve a hotel room so you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

229
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,820
room in the same hotel you can always

230
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:17,200
make some changes before the date

231
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:18,760
without any penalty usually and that way

232
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,340
you're not forced to<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk a couple</font>

233
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,340
blocks or find a more expensive hotel

234
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:30,730
and lastly<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Betty mentioned we</font>
