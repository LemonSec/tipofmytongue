00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:17,830
i'm winching shower<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am</font>

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,560
to the compare astac and today I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:22,900
to talk to something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the traffic</font>

engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain context and as</font>

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:27,250
measurement based one and as a piece of

7
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:29,619
collective book and I'm just speaking on

8
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,500
behalf of the team and we work closely

9
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:35,050
with our industrial partner<font color="#CCCCCC"> but our six</font>

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,850
who has an implementation of this

measurement<font color="#E5E5E5"> based into the main traffic</font>

12
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:50,850

13
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:50,849
the control I guess let us know

14
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:05,319
I is this problem yeah it's Rory okay

15
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:06,970
good thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you now and today and the</font>

16
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,919
planning is there we are going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

17
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,500
what do we mean by this measurement

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,530
based mechanism and why we could

19
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,180
possibly wanting it what are challenges

20
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,820
in general will in building such a

21
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,860
system and then i<font color="#CCCCCC"> will show you a</font>

22
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,660
concrete k is a problem a challenge that

00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:26,520
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scalability one including a</font>

24
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:30,610
such a system so let's begin with bgp

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,039
101 you are not liking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ever the</font>

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,950
like writing particle of other flavors

29
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,990
like ospf it isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking to account</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,970
performance metrics enduring decision

31
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:48,399
right and possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the worst part</font>

32
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:50,770
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that when you are</font>

33
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,170
performing traffic engineering wheezing

34
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,910
a network as long as there is no

35
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,700
congestion the delay is quite

36
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:01,509
predictable but when it comes to the

37
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,150
interdomain context one has actually to

38
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:06,159
measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know what are actually delay</font>

39
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:08,130
of or<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain areas past because there</font>

40
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">are so many factors beyond our control</font>

41
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:14,680
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that ok we are going to</font>

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,510
choose the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best bgp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop based on</font>

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:22,899
digitally for example we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just kind</font>

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,089
of choosing it sounds very easy and

46
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,660
straightforward and now i can read from

47
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:31,390
some of your faces saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so what and</font>

48
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">i perfectly understand just looking at</font>

49
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,010
this list of publications and when they

that is half of my age could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be anything</font>

but sexy but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point I'm bringing up</font>

54
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:53,109
this stuff today is that actually it is

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,570
not a trivial quest and more efforts are

56
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:58,360
actually needed to turn this idea into a

57
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,070
well working system and talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,760
efforts in challenge I just think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

59
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:06,579
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to measure the delay</font>

64
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,629
them and how we clearly possibly do it

65
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,950
and where I'm going to demystify some of

66

source or commercial ones provide these

77
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:50,329
kind of functionalities and there are

78
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,310
some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> also offer very beautiful</font>

85
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:12,349
statistics a little bit different we

<font color="#E5E5E5">emit kind of finding out a subset of</font>

prefixes there's a that are important so

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,079
we can folks the measurements and

89
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:23,120
optimizations on them and we were and we

90
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,020
will come back to this later<font color="#E5E5E5"> in detail</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and once the perfect size of importance</font>

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,280
are selected we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure</font>

93
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,280
them right and the first of all we are

94
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to find IP addresses that is</font>

95
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,080
responding to active measurements and

96
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,289
one common trick in topology measurement

97
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,840
is to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into traffic traces or DNS</font>

00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:48,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">request logs to finding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP addresses</font>

99

100
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:55,150
TCP syn whatever so we can measure delay

101
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:57,979
in and last order and one uncommon

102
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,198
operation involved here is that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

103
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:03,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to steer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the measurement traffic</font>

104
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,159
by all possible between next hops and

105
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:10,940
this can be done with a variety<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font>

106
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:13,400
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use our sauce based sauce base</font>

107
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,400
running mechanism like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of segment</font>

108
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:19,320
routing or in more flexible sdn flavors

109
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:22,020
and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doable stuff and</font>

110
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,490
finally it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rough it's a route</font>

111
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,349
decision here's how we choose the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best</font>

112
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:31,310
bgp next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop these are measurements and</font>

113
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:33,750
there could be multiple possible

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,690
objectives and the realization<font color="#CCCCCC"> of which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cost and first we will reveal quickly</font>

125
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,900
how we calculate a transit cast and we

126
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,760
know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are two parameters</font>

exceed the CDR rate possibly we have a

what no matter how much you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use right</font>

135
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,880
and in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have incentive to</font>

two three<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is the cheapest one</font>

146
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:03,210
actually the transit to is the most

147
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:07,500
costly and before the optimization is

148
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:09,870
has has begun we actually consume more

149
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,330
transit to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entrance of one and they</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all both of them already exceed the CDR</font>

151
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:20,520
right and on same time we have trans s3

152
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:22,410
which is largely unused and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its 95th</font>

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,570
percentile then with this far below a

00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,960
CDR right so what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> after</font>

155
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:31,590

156

increase in the usage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trans a 1 + 23</font>

+

158
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,710
decrease in transit to which prevents a

159
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,109
even higher in 95th percentile bandwidth

160
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:44,229
usage on transit to and eventually a

161
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,750
smaller bill and on 23 we just kind of

162
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:49,210
little push it as closest to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CDR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8</font>

163
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:51,010
now you must<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is doable even</font>

164
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,659
with fixing playing with local

165
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:56,500
preferences we are going to set a higher

166
00:07:52,660 --> 00:08:00,699
value for transit with low costs but so

167
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:02,650
why the tribal measuring audience<font color="#CCCCCC"> doves</font>

168
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:04,600
because there are moments that

169
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,359
performance factors come into play right

170
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,090
and the rule number one if possible

171
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,320
don't let instant bet ways exceed the

172
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,900
CDR rate because there could be

<font color="#CCCCCC">Piccolo's is whatever not interesting</font>

174

175
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,190
here cares where you when you don't

176

hear on this graphic is it has literally

zero packet loss that is to say the

natural decision of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP is suboptimal</font>

190

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:09,190
measurement and your conclusion but once

193
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,400
noticed the solution is quite simple

194
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:16,390
just switch to transit done much better

195
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:20,709
and even<font color="#E5E5E5"> when there is no obvious trend</font>

no are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no obvious packet loss the</font>

197
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,839
traffic can still be said center on a

198
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:27,580
slope as and here is an example between

199
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,610
transit one transit indifference is

200
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,760
about 17 milliseconds is quite long time

201
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,800
networking and again this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

202
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,240
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be seen if we don't</font>

203
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,279

analysis and to be sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

205
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,160
there's such differences

206
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,310
and once noticed we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimize them</font>

207
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:48,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">and all these three cases are also the</font>

208
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,939
reasons why we might be wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

kind of measurement based traffic

211
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,139
needs won't be reviewed if we don't

212
00:09:53,509 --> 00:10:00,019
measure and that is so far for album

what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about in bham part well inbound</font>

216
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,880
traffic engineering with bgp is known to

217
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:14,359
the lack of fine-grained and effective

218
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,009
measures is preparing stuff and bgp

219

communities but it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

don't it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think about mad</font>

multi exact discriminating in BGP it

00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:56,180
works sort of like mad with remote yet

232
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:59,560
targeted influence right the idea is

233
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:02,630
based on observation that if the traffic

237
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,920
that the traffic receiving a s is going

238
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:15,709
to see the traffic coming in a different

commenting a different ingress point so

240
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,719
if the traffic's allison is is just

again<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't stare too hard integrated in</font>

293
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,630
the data graph and so we have to predict

294
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,550
for future moments what are the prefix

295
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,230
going to be important and they repeat

00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:44,349
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prediction from time to</font>

297
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,810
time talking about prediction we are

298
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:49,779
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it since we do that dimensioning</font>

299
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,910
it was a lot of algorithms and doing

300
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:54,430
these predictions and the point is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

301
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,769
these mathematical models<font color="#CCCCCC"> good for math</font>

302
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,800
making models<font color="#CCCCCC"> just are just so</font>

303
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:04,120
complicated when we have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> tens</font>

304
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:07,779
active perfect to predict so our quest

305
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:10,180
is to predictively select BGP perfect

306
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:13,150
destination prefixes that stands for a

307
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:16,029
large portion of traffic but<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a very</font>

308
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,339
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple math their skills out right</font>

309
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,779
and we are doing this for the purpose of

310
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:23,020
saving resources that were using

311
00:14:19,779 --> 00:14:25,960
measurement and optimization and we also

312
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:28,930
know at the same time if we are if you

313
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">arrive at some in this problem you also</font>

314
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,040
save the resources on disciplines well

315
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,839
just imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> previously we have a full</font>

316
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,050
bitch<font color="#CCCCCC"> p writing table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the routers and</font>

317
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:41,350
now we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> one optimizer root for each</font>

318
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:44,199
selected perfect and finally a default

319
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:48,279
one for the rest this transition allows

320
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:50,800
us to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> these cheaper DC switches</font>

321
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:53,200

325
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,010

forwarding and table caching and

the preference for lower perfect train a

<font color="#CCCCCC">old unsexy scenario of traffic</font>

438
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:17,890
engineering which happens to be

439
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:20,750
measurement based if we give it a a

440

close look<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a second assault we can</font>

441
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually find they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite interesting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">problems remains</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right and we just dive</font>

quickly-- dived into one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

444
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:32,660
scalability one how we select prefix of

445
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,700
important volumes and by leveraging the

446
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,010
traffic volume characters we actually

447
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:39,650
use a we can use very simple method in

448
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,030
doing so and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there are many</font>

449
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">more challenges</font>

450
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:46,160
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them is again concerning</font>

451
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,650
measurement and how to select probes

452
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:51,430
with reliable measurements as I have

453
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned we might discover several a</font>

multiple and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they're responding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,250
our active measurements and they are

00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,870
measuring they are all measuring the

457
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,960
same as past but yet they are different

458
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:04,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">in IP levels for example and natural</font>

459
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,580
question to ask is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that why they</font>

460
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,870
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> different how they are different and</font>

461
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:11,840
where does this differences take place

462
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:14,110
and how by<font color="#E5E5E5"> understanding these questions</font>

463
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,409
is going to help us selecting the best

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">probes to use so that we don't just</font>

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:21,980
accidentally switched fully gigabytes

466

for 14 from one transit provider to

467

group these<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTT time series into two</font>

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:50,030
can see and in the paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of</font>

476
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:51,710
said earlier we explain what our why

477
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:54,410
this is happening how we can possibly

Cashin one if we put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the right</font>

00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:11,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm happy to take questions and and also</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm happy to take short speech</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">discussing questions sharing your</font>

opinions on this would you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

509
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,270
this scenario and your experiments on

measurement and traffic engineering

511
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:34,530
thank you very much any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font>

512
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:36,720
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have specific questions just</font>

513
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,850
so you know that the engineer who

514
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally code the system is also</font>

515
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,409
sitting down among you if you have

516
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:48,809
specific questions don't hesitate is

517
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:51,050
willing to take it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so thank you</font>

518
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,050
very much
