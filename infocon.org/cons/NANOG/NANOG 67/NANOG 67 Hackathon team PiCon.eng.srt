welcome back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> general session if</font>

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,120
you're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in please find a seat</font>

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,610
because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,720
time so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to welcome</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up Brandon</font>

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,430
Bennett from<font color="#CCCCCC"> team PyCon correct who's</font>

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:30,089
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give us an overview of their</font>

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:31,890
hack from the hackathon<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok welcome</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

8
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:32,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope everybody is nice and sleepy</font>

9
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,570
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to be pretty</font>

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">boring from from lunch anyway so my name</font>

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,800
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brandon Bennett I worked on the team</font>

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,800
with three other people and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created a</font>

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,839
Raspberry Pi based console server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

14
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,089
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking to yourself this must</font>

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">be pretty easy right you take Raspberry</font>

16
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:57,539
Pi you plug in serial port<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey look I</font>

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,629
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Raspberry Pi console server right</font>

18
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,539
um so we decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to take it a</font>

19
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:05,580
step further so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font>

20
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,650
at when you actually need a console

21
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:12,090
server and how how we can get

22
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,920
connectivity to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand-new pop or a</font>

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,450
brand new data center<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something where</font>

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,580
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't necessarily have connectivity</font>

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,950
yet so has this ever happened anybody

26
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:22,140
with her you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

27
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,240
somebody from like smart hands or from

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,350
the the local Colo maybe they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,020
work for your company and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're trying</font>

30
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get them to get an IP address or at</font>

31
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,130
least share their screen so you can get

32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,548
on on the device so we tried to solve

33
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,699
this problem so what we did is we took a

34
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,070
raspberry pi they cost 35 bucks you got

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,659
a USB serial adapter you can plug it in

36
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,309
you can also add a 3g<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 4g card and</font>

37
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:49,860
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually wrote with software to</font>

38
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:53,520
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raspberry Pi call back into the</font>

39
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,170
server so as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the Raspberry Pi</font>

40
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,149
comes up it starts running our software

41
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,299
it monitors<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of its interfaces and</font>

42
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:02,670
reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's USB ports and all of its IP</font>

43
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:07,289
addresses back to a central server so

44
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,360
this allows us to find out exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

45
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:11,310
this comes online so you got a 3g 4g

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,200
card plugged in here you got your USB

47
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,570
card plugged in here all the tech has to

48
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,209
do is take this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than fifty</font>

49
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,049
dollar device plug it into your to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

50
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,410
console server and now we

51
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,090
have access right so no no experience

52
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,430
needed on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other end this thing gets</font>

53
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:27,860
lost big deal it's cheap right we can

54
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:33,930
replace it we can we can send out

55
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:35,880
hundreds of them so quick demo here is

56
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:42,920
the web interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me make that a</font>

57
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:42,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bigger that was the wrong button</font>

58
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:51,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so here here's the the web</font>

59
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,820
interface that we created so pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

60
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">after the the console registers in we</font>

61
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,750
store that in a database somewhere and

62
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:02,910
of course it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not working right now</font>

63
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:04,500
live demos don't ever do them all so

64
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,670
each one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the console servers</font>

65
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,290
actually comes in registers as IP

66
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,530
addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and its console ports you can</font>

67
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,570
see them directly right here the the

68
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:16,140
console port we have right here is

69
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,239
called Luke and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was up the status</font>

70
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:25,950
would be be read here on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the side it's</font>

71
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:28,290
not fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so why did we use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

72
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,000
Raspberry Pi it's inexpensive it's linux

73
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same stuff that</font>

74
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,200
you would be used to on<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux it's</font>

75
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,850
puppet<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its shuffle ball it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ansel</font>

76
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,799
a bowl a bowl it has a wide range of

77
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,290
hardware because it's linux you can plug

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,739
in most 3g or 4g linux-based or<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux</font>

79
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,780
supported cards we don't want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

80
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:51,780
do our own encryption right doing your

81
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">own encryption is stupid so we get linux</font>

82
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,510
encryption with this which means you can

83
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,930
integrate this into your crib rail

84
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,690
system or use simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH keys and then</font>

85
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,920
finally it's it's got some pretty decent

86
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:04,260
harder on it these are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raspberry Pi</font>

87
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,958
threes if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your console</font>

88
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,370
service that you have now you'll you'll

89
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,830
find out they probably do run linux

90
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,660
already they've got like 4 Meg's random

91
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,760
ramen them and like eight megs of flash

92
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,600
right you can't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> run chef on those</font>

93
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,668
if you wanted to so our next steps here

94
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,710
is in this web interface to actually

95
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:25,859
have a console access directly in there

96
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,750
also provide an API to allow robots to

97
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,550
it there's no reason why once the device

98
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">comes up that I need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sit there and</font>

99
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,960
still type in commands why not have a

100
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">robot</font>

101
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,349
and find out there's a new device that

102
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,350
popped online and automatically start

103
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:41,259
configuring that for me we are currently

104
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">just pulling all the interfaces for both</font>

105
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,539
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the USB serial ports as well as the</font>

106
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,219
interfaces using some sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> event</font>

107
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,780
notification like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> dev would make</font>

108
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,310
this a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and then finally</font>

109
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,520
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no reason why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to be</font>

110
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:55,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">limited to this small form factor right</font>

111
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,240
the the chips that are in these USB

112
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:01,239
adapters are really cheap off-the-shelf

113
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,039
chips if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy one at a time you get</font>

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,150
them for like four bucks if you by like

115
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,699
a hundred of time you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat them</font>

116
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,960
down underneath the dollar there's no

117
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:09,220
reason why you couldn't design your own

118
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,630
board and actually create a full

119
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,180
functioning console server out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

120
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,060
for thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheaper than</font>

121
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,229
than what you're currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying</font>

122
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,180
finally here's everybody that worked

123
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,830
with it was an<font color="#E5E5E5"> honor working with uh</font>

124
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,349
everybody up here they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart and</font>

125
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was a whole lot of fun so thank you</font>

126
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:28,840
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is it if you want to check</font>

127
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:30,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">out our code it's ugly right now but</font>

128
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,138
everybody's super excited about

129
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">continuing on working on this pull</font>

130
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,090
requests are welcomed thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>
