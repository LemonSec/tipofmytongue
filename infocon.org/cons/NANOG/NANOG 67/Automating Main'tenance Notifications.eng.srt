00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:11,020
hello good afternoon I'm Eric and

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,480
joining me<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is Francisco by a show</font>

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,190
of hands let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me know how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,099
have worked with maiden certifications

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:20,369
before great we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in the right place</font>

6
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:23,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">so for those of you who aren't familiar</font>

7
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintence notifications are messages</font>

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:29,229
that are sent typically from providers

9
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:32,070
to customers sometimes between peers who

10
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,050
exchange data directly there often

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,780
delivered via email and they are

12
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,250
manually processed in many cases and of

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,420
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> whenever you do anything manually</font>

14
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:43,600
certainly when I do things manually

15
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,640
sometimes I make mistakes they also take

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,289
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to process manually this</font>

17
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,730
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can consume a</font>

18
00:00:47,289 --> 00:00:51,460
significant amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work on the part</font>

19
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:53,919
of our operations teams to react<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and</font>

20
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,239
respond<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so it's an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area that's right</font>

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,820
for automation there's a lot of work

22
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,078
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taken care of directly by</font>

23
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,089
computers here much better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than humans</font>

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:03,370
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problems that prevent us</font>

25
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:05,190
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this largely due to the fact</font>

26
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,090
that many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these email messages are</font>

27
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,530
intended to be consumed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by humans</font>

28
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,860
they're not really designed for

29
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,140
computers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work with what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be</font>

30
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:16,240
talking about today<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be going over</font>

31
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook's approach to automating</font>

32
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,589
Minnesota fication 'he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> francisco is</font>

33
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,669
going to go into this in detail in

34
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,350
particular he's going to address<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font>

35
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:25,330
the challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've experienced</font>

36
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,360
trying to take the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

37
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:30,220
process that motivates our work towards

38
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,140
standardizing the format of maintenance

39
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,450
notifications we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about those</font>

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:36,430
standards by showing some examples of

41
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:38,320
how they can be put to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use and then wrap</font>

42
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:47,980
up talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we are working on</font>

43
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:50,169
next so acidic mentioned processing

00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">Monday needs notifications and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> montanus</font>

45
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,930
in general is hard thing to do and I'm

46
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:57,730
not even<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking out here about</font>

47
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:59,770
automating I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

48
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,980
manually is a very time-consuming and

49
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,660
error-prone process at Facebook two

50
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,850
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we started having this problem</font>

51
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:10,030
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were spending much more time</font>

52
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">than what we were willing for to spend</font>

53
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:17,030
on maintenances and we say to those

54
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,890
you know that one day<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had a man</font>

55
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:22,670
Dana's that was about to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in less</font>

56
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:25,399
than an hour and we will notice the

57
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:28,280
spontaneous it was more than 30 circuits

58
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,870
and we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to try to</font>

59
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:33,739
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic away from those</font>

60
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,239
circuits right and at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we</font>

61
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,099
didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any automation and we had</font>

62
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:39,170
some scripting and some data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

63
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,959
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> convert some of the data into</font>

64
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual circuits but it took a lot a lot</font>

65
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,620
of time at by the time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

66
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,440
maintenance was starting we were

67
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,200
finishing with this and we noticed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

68
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,040
we didn't really have the capacity to

69
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,690
take this command<font color="#CCCCCC"> dainius right so</font>

70
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,849
that's when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided to create current</font>

71
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:02,540
maintenance which is a set of tools that

72
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:06,339
helps us automatically parsing<font color="#CCCCCC"> partment</font>

73
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:11,030
danaans notifications and take action on

74
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:14,599
this so to give a brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> description of</font>

75
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:17,299
how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> workflow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this system works we</font>

76
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:20,030
receive emails which are received by the

77
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:21,739
scheduler and the scheduler sends these

78
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,280
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> carrier mentalist ivory</font>

79
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:30,079
which is delivery that we use to pass

80
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,910
the emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> and basically extract any</font>

81
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:35,209
information that we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> schedule the</font>

82
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:37,730
spontaneous so when the data comes back

83
00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">we save it as events in a database on</font>

84
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:43,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other hand we have a current mess</font>

85
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:46,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">than mine sorry maintenance worker which</font>

86
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,760
is constantly checking the database

87
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:52,730
check if anything is allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start in</font>

88
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,290
what we do it in less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than an hour but</font>

89
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,918
this is obviously something that can be

90
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">changed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in that case we do a couple</font>

91
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:03,410
of things which I will describe in later

92
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:07,430
slides and ultimately act on the network

93
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:11,120
to be able to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this maintenance</font>

94
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:16,310
doesn't affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> us so first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will talk</font>

95
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,930
about the scheduler there is a set of

96
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:21,048
things that we support in the scheduler

97
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:24,770
we support right now more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

98
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:28,008
provider templates that we automatically

99
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,409
bars we support scheduled maintenance

100
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:33,110
ease which is basically any new mundania

101
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,259
that we have we schedule it in our

102
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:39,110
system but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we also do a ventilation and</font>

103
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:43,430
this is because many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintenance</font>

104
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,840
that we receive are related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other</font>

105
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,159
maintenance that we already<font color="#E5E5E5"> received</font>

106
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,400
before and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is that</font>

107
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:54,409
terios send more than one<font color="#E5E5E5"> month in ian's</font>

108
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,729
generally and they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be rescheduled</font>

109
00:04:54,409 --> 00:05:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can be cancellations they can be</font>

110
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:03,979
addition of circuits additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> days did</font>

111
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,090
a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we usually do</font>

112
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:09,440
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the maintenance IV in them in</font>

113
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,289
in the maintenance<font color="#E5E5E5"> enta fication to</font>

114
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,789
group everything together another thing

115
00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:15,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is passing matching of</font>

116
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:19,430
circuits and there is two reasons of

117
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:24,289
this one is that sometimes carriers are

118
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:28,069
not very<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent on how they send</font>

119
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:29,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">their circuits basically for example the</font>

120
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:32,479
provisioning team and the maintenance

121
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:35,180
team they said they may send<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

122
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,580
circuit IDs which are basically the same

123
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,530
circuit ID for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human but for a</font>

124
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,130
computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> they they may be slightly</font>

125
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:45,258
different they may have included spaces

126
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:49,340
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> circuit ID and then on</font>

127
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:51,680
maintenance they remove them or slashes

128
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:55,190
instead of the dashes or stuff like that

129
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,860
right on the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand it may happen</font>

130
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:00,740
that that it's our fault our

131
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:03,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">professional teams see spaces and on the</font>

132
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:07,039
secretaries and they may simplify it for

133
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,729
database storage right so that obviously

134
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,949
is fixed but until<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we need to be</font>

135
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:15,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to parse this the other reason why</font>

136
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:19,300
we do fuzzy matching is that we receive

137
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:24,500
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of emails</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are not really</font>

138
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:26,090
pertinent so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we cannot</font>

139
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,039
parse a maintenance because we don't

140
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> template for that that may be a</font>

141
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,199
valid maintenance or not and the way

142
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:35,479
that we discover this is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

143

146
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,090
circuits and we basically go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:54,020
care about is there in that email if

we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically drop the email because it's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not something that we care</font>

about if<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and there is something</font>

157
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">started doing recently is that we</font>

00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:18,190
started rejecting or confirming

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,169
maintenances with certain carriers which

160
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:24,050
with which we have an agreement so

00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,880
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we detect that that the</font>

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,870
and they will well know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything there is a pre</font>

contact us or send an alert notification

maintaining notifications<font color="#CCCCCC"> among of which</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">about ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent are new so these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

177
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,020
easy to bar or to process we just create

178
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:21,770
a new event about<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of them</font>

179
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:24,260
are related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to previous notifications</font>

180
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,380
that we received and these are the ones

181
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:31,669
that are really<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even by</font>

182
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:34,120
humans right so detecting that that we

183
00:08:31,669 --> 00:08:36,409
already have that in our database and

184
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,360
checking what's the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

185
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:43,218
what we received before and what we need

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:46,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do now it may be quite time consuming</font>

187
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:46,660
and the other fifty percent are the ones

188
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,850
that

189
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">we are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interested and this may be as</font>

190
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,750
i said before like there is another a

191
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:57,189
lot of females that may arrive to this

192
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:58,870
email box they may be basically things

193
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,569
that are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> monday</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nurses for example</font>

194
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:04,060
tickets and stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are sent in</font>

195
00:09:01,569 --> 00:09:05,949
earth or even monday notifications that

196
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:11,349
they are updates that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

197
00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:13,540
about so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example a reminder that the</font>

198
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,490
maintenance is how to start or updates

199
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:20,889
during the maintenance and stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

200
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:24,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to what process what this</font>

201
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:29,139
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that every every month we will</font>

202
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:31,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">be using about two engineers to process</font>

203
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:33,250
this maintenance is manually and doing

204
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:36,189
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do with automation</font>

205
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:41,620
and this scene this means more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

206
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:44,319
hundred engineers hours hours a month so

207
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,750
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to notice that these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

208
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:49,180
like one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> mundane is a month are</font>

209
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,279
they we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> having some days more than</font>

210
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:55,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten mundania seized and some of the</font>

211
00:09:51,279 --> 00:10:00,490
fantasies are more than 30 40 circuits

212
00:09:55,449 --> 00:10:05,079
worth right so now let's talk a bit out

213
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:06,579
the the worker so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a set of</font>

214
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:09,459
features that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we supporting in the</font>

215
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:12,630
worker one of the main ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> is audits</font>

216
00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:16,899
and before the maintenance starts what

217
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:19,420
we do one important audit which is

218
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:22,060
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> simulations</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

219
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,490
relations we do it periodically network

220
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,369
network so we leverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> this system in</font>

221
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,230
the worker we just to refresh when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

222
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,209
maintenance is about to start and the

223
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:34,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of this is to check if the</font>

224
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:37,899
maintenance may affect us when it's

225
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:40,268
going to happen we also do this at the

226
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">time of scheduling but the problem with</font>

227
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:46,029
that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a detainee scheduling we we</font>

228
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:49,000
may detect things like a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

229
00:10:46,029 --> 00:10:50,980
that has to pass they have two different

230
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,779
maintenances that affect one and the

231
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,620
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> path at the same time so we may</font>

232
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:57,330
reject that at scheduling time

233
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,680
but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

234
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,750
to be safe at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time that the</font>

235
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,510
maintenance starts because the network

236
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">will change in that time we may have a</font>

237
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,920
fiber got going on or we may have

238
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:09,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">provision if new circuits or the</font>

239
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">Commission's some other circuits right</font>

240
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,370
so we do this at the start of

241
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintenance if we see any problem we do</font>

242
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:21,089
automation automatic cancellation of

243
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">this maintenance or this we try right so</font>

244
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:26,370
we send an email to a carrier asking for

245
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,230
the cancellation and we also alarm

246
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:32,430
internally so that a human can be

247
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">engaged depending on how serious this</font>

248
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:39,779
problem might be if everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes well</font>

249
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:43,620
there is a deep privatization of of the

250
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:46,200
traffic in the circuits affected which

251
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,470
means that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic won't go through</font>

252
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,910
those circuits and after the maintenance

253
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:56,339
we also have a set of audits<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

254
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:59,130
check<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> errors in the circuit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> crcs or</font>

255
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:02,459
any other and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the circuit are up</font>

256
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:05,010
or not here we also leverage some other

257
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:09,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">system that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have in place already for</font>

258
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:12,360
fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> cuts and we basically treat it as</font>

259
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:17,689
a fiber cut but we know that it has to

260
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:20,490
do is related to a maintenance right so

261
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:22,580
what we do is we send an email to the

262
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:27,740
courier and we follow up automatically

263
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:30,510
with the career until this is result so

264
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:34,650
what this means is that well we were

265
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:37,770
spending two engineers worth of time a

266
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:39,180
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for the scheduling but if we</font>

267
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:42,569
account for everything that we have to

268
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:45,560
do for actually draining the traffic

269
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,630
from circuits we will be talking about

270
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:54,089
five engineers at least and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than a</font>

271
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:58,980
thousand engineer hours a month so this

272
00:12:54,089 --> 00:13:00,810
graph is just an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of traffic in a</font>

273
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,290
in a circle in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an actual maintenance</font>

274
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:05,939
that we have is showing the two lines

275
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:07,890
they start of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintenance the end of</font>

276
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,970
the maintenance<font color="#CCCCCC"> how the traffic an hour</font>

277
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,060
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the montane</font>

278
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:13,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">he's being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drained at the time of the</font>

279
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintenance there is no traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

280
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:18,629
after the maintenance well the traffic

281
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:23,639
automatically returns us as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the</font>

282
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:28,319
maintenance ends last let's talk about

283
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:32,759
the workflow sorry that the library that

284
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:34,290
processes the day emails so the things

285
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:38,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we pass in the maintenance</font>

286
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:41,519
notification is the vendor the

287
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:43,469
maintenance ID the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of dates this</font>

288
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,019
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> because someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tennessee's have more</font>

289
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:48,540
than one date where they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work we</font>

290
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:52,139
passed the start date and end date for

291
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,449
each of the dates that are involved if

292
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,199
the maintenance is<font color="#CCCCCC"> serviced affecting or</font>

293
00:13:54,449 --> 00:14:00,089
not and the circuits that are involved

294
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,149
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that we</font>

295
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:05,149
could support is just what we decided to

296
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:07,620
support because it's what we care about

297
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:10,410
obviously the system could be extended

298
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,389
to support saving the description the

299
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:14,339
contact and stuff like that we already

300
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:17,100
have that information in other places or

301
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:21,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">at least the contact so we decided to</font>

302
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">just care about this some of the</font>

303
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,420
challenges of parsing well<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the</font>

304
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one is we are passing emails right</font>

305
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,559
and persimmons is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard it's not meant</font>

306
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:37,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be read by a computer's so that</font>

307
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:40,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the main problem we haven't known</font>

308
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:42,388
templates so the carriers will use a

309
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:44,699
template normally but we don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

310
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:46,259
it works when we see a template is

311
00:14:44,699 --> 00:14:48,479
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious what we have to do and</font>

312
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> parse but that's just</font>

313
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,930
the waist template so we may pass what

314
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:57,599
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed before but what about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

315
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:00,479
we receive a cancellation how will that

316
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,370
look like in a new template will they

317
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,860
put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a note in in the maintenance</font>

318
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:07,170
will they put it as something in the

319
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,920
title we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know so the only</font>

320
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:14,759
way to find out is well to see what will

321
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:19,579
receive in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the future another problem</font>

322
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:21,860
that we have is templates change so

323
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,780
this again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the emails are not</font>

324
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,850
supposed to be read<font color="#CCCCCC"> via a computer right</font>

325
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:30,500
so carriers may just change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the template</font>

326
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,180
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see a problem with these</font>

327
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they assume that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a human will</font>

328
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,680
read this<font color="#E5E5E5"> or human can read any template</font>

329
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:40,609
they send so as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the information</font>

330
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:45,939
is in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> email who cares right well we</font>

331
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:49,400
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so another one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is humorous</font>

332
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:51,530
many companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> have templates but the</font>

333
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,510
actual templates are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really filled</font>

334
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:56,630
out by automation systems or computers

335
00:15:53,510 --> 00:16:01,160
they are fill out by<font color="#CCCCCC"> humans and many</font>

336
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:03,860
others come from that like dates are not

337
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:09,770
formatted<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same way in each email or</font>

338
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:12,290
even very very small problems like an

339
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,910
additional space in<font color="#E5E5E5"> some place may cause</font>

340
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:17,240
a problem if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have this into</font>

341
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:20,060
consideration on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

342
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,760
handcraft maintenances is another

343
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:26,180
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some carriers may do and</font>

344
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:29,710
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> having for example maintaining</font>

345
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,930
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maintenances attached as a PDF</font>

346
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:36,170
on an email which is extremely hard to

347
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:38,930
parse besides these there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

348
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:43,010
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we saw which is they are</font>

349
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">not inherent to parsing the image but</font>

350
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,530
for example some carriers wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

351
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:51,589
maintain SI deve with the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> or we've</font>

352
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:54,020
seen also carriers reusing maintaining

353
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,600
society from before so our systems fail

354
00:16:54,020 --> 00:17:01,970
trying to match these two previous

355
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:05,110
maintenance so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all I had i will</font>

356
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:08,060
pass back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work who will talk about</font>

357
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:15,290
the work that we are doing to make this

358
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:17,149
last part easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so as francisco</font>

359
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,639
mentioned their number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenges to</font>

360
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:21,650
parsing these emails and all of them

361
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,990
stem from a lack of standardization

362
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:25,220
these emails are inconsistent across

363
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,359
different providers and their

364
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,250
inconsistent even within a given

365
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:30,020
provider so what we've been working on

366
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,670
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of other people is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

367
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,360
establish some kind of conventions for

368
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,910
how to form

369
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,860
this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> key among them is to</font>

370
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,020
establish a list of mandatory fields

371
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,360
what we've aimed to do is identify what

372
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,370
we think are the minimum information

373
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,049
that are required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to automate and</font>

374
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,239
dispatch this kind of work internally

375
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:49,970
and then to say those things are

376
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,559
required to implement the standard of

377
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,630
course you can do more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that if you</font>

378
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,510
want but we're trying to keep it as

379
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:58,370
small as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of this we're</font>

380
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,500
looking to extend the existing ical

381
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:02,780
format at their heart maintenances are

382
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,150
basically events and did take place in

383
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,860
time and so I Cal's a great way that

384
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,450
already exists to schedule events across

385
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,850
organizations and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking to use</font>

386
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,770
that as a basis when we do that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

387
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:14,480
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> come for free like handling time</font>

388
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,030
in different formats and different time

389
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,230
zones and we also get some the benefit

390
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,090
of a deployed base that we can

391
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,309
interoperate with we have a draft

392
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,020
standard that's available for review and

393
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,760
we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of Python</font>

394
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,530
libraries we participated in the

395
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,510
hackathon this past weekend that was a

396
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">great experience we got a lot of benefit</font>

397
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:33,559
out of that the libraries are greatly

398
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,870
improved for handling the generation and

399
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:37,730
the parsing of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> messages we also</font>

400
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:40,219
were able to thanks to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the help of</font>

401
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,790
Russell from links and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cody from</font>

provider need to notify customers for

415
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:17,230
that and then a what would the workflow

416
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,520
be for the consumer of that notification

417
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:22,280
one common thing is converting time

418
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,870
stamps from whatever the provider hands

419
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,299
you to something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's meaningful</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

you want to do more with integration

428
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,510
you can move on to more advanced things

429
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:48,640
like ticket creation so an example of

430
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:51,040
what this workflow might look like the

431
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,620
first thing and that animation didn't

432
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,760
work the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font>

433
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,949
determining<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maintenance is required</font>

434
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,660
that's what the provider will do they'll

435
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:00,340
list out all of the affected services

436
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:02,830
that are associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that work if</font>

437
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,090
you have an element in a path of an

438
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,679
optical network you might have many

439
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,030
services running over it so you need to

440
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,400
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what all of those services</font>

441
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,290
are then you'd list the affected

442
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,120
accounts associated with that to gather

443
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:14,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">data that you'd use to notify the</font>

444
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,540
customer such as email<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses</font>

445
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:19,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">generate the maintenance notification</font>

446
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,760
email and again this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font>

447
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,470
would exist in with the standard and

448
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way it does today we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

suggesting that anyone changed the human

450
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:31,830
facing content that they have you would

451
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:34,150
generate a ical attachment this is the

452
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:36,159
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's formatted for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

454
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,630
existing human facing information and

455
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:42,460
then send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that email on to the recipient</font>

456
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,110
the recipient would receive that

457
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,790
information and then look at its

458
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:47,709
contents to<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine if the standard</font>

for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> generate a ticket and if</font>

462
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:55,540
there isn't any computer formatted

463
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,879
information there the email can be

464
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:00,730
passed on to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a human parser for the same</font>

466
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,910
huge advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can save a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

467
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,400
our organizations a lot of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if</font>

468
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:07,840
you don't go to the extent that

469
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,760
Francisco and Facebook have<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

470
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,330
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of needless work that can be</font>

471
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,310
eliminated<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the standard is available</font>

472
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,649
here's an example of what a formatted

473
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,230
message looks like this is would be a

474

<font color="#CCCCCC">pier in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a attachment to an email as you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">can see it fits on one slide it's still</font>

476
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,840
fairly readable the complexity here is

477
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,600
not too great most of this information

478
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,830
is standard ical there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a small</font>

479
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,780
amount of it that's actually the

480
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,490
extension and as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

481
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:35,290
making or taking advantage of the

482
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:38,200
existing mechanism within the ical

483
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,530
standard to extend it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> tested this for</font>

484
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,460
compatibility we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all of the</font>

485
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:45,070
calendaring systems that we've tested

486
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:47,020
silently ignore all of these extra

487
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,639
fields so again you get backwards

488
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,100
compatibility with existing deployed

489
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,690
calendar systems some of the fields of

490
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,240
interest in particular there's a

491
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:58,510
identifier field this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a row</font>

492
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,400
database table you can use to<font color="#E5E5E5"> associate</font>

493
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,840
different updates with each other<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

494
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,110
if all the other related information

495
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:08,320
about the maintenance changes there's a

496
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:10,000
sequence field again part of ical and

497
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,399
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> orders</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the new updates so it's</font>

498
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,530
possible for you know what is the newest

499
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,450
information in case the messages get

500
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:19,540
delivered out of order to your parsing

501
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,220
application there's a field technique

502
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:24,129
identify the provider so we know who

503
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:25,750
exactly is sending this notification we

504
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,000
have a feel to identify the account in

505
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:29,890
case within an organization we have more

506
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one organ or more than one group</font>

507
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is using the services of this</font>

508
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,740
provider and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dispatch</font>

509
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,390
internally then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in a field to</font>

510
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:40,090
identify the maintenance if I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

511
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:41,860
call the NOC for this provider and tell

512
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:43,330
them here's what I'm talking about this

513
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,370
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintance I'm referring to this</font>

514
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,620
is the field the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> this field</font>

515
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,949
is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use and then finally we</font>

516
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:52,300
have a object<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

517
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,610
very generic we haven't said exactly

518
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">what this needs to be it's a text blob</font>

519
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:59,949
in our standard you can put in a circuit

520
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:02,199
ID for example or an IP address of a bgp

521

523
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:09,610
notifying for to identify that service

526
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:16,480
field and we allow more than one of

<font color="#E5E5E5">these for each notification the last</font>

impact levels that we've standardized

531
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:31,150
such as an outage degraded or reduce

adopting this and implementing it in its

545
00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,130
early form so we can get some

546
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,620
operational experience and learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

547
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,960
that to understand where we need to make

<font color="#CCCCCC">improvements or where we may hidden</font>

where we may have significant problems

550
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,559
well

551
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,750
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> both of those things and use that</font>

552
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:13,158
to refine the standard and then run it

553
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,470
through some sort of standardizations

554
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:18,350
process such as the the beat cop or

555
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:21,080
perhaps an RFC once we've done that it's

556
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:23,959
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to advocate for the implementation</font>

558

587
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:36,860
pipe my first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is is the code</font>

588
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,970
being provided does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> include the</font>

589
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,709
templates that were discussed by

Facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the human parser or is it</font>

591
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:44,960
more focused towards the bc o P stuff

592
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:49,129
yeah the code libraries are focused on

593
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,960
the bc o P so the gate library that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I or</font>

594
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,549
they get your all that I mentioned is

all focused on the become but all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

detach it from that but yeah there may

603
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:17,450
be some<font color="#E5E5E5"> news in the future and the</font>

604
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,250
second<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is there any discussion</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these of these messages yeah that's</font>

610
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,629
definitely a concern the draft standard

611
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:32,430
has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> section that addresses the</font>

612
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,950
security concerns that's a problem that

00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">exists</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already have that issue</font>

614
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:38,970
not just if you automate but even if

615
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,140
your manly processing it's possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

618
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,250
that could cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> harm to our networks or</font>

particular standard for example PGP

622
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:56,100
would be the most obvious choice here I

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's also options out of band</font>

of email within the iCal standard

625
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,950
there's a notion of using<font color="#CCCCCC"> caldav as a</font>

626
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,409
means for exchanging calendar

speak for myself you guys seem to be

639
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,100
infamous for generating lots and lots of

maintenance notifications on hey we're

understand having an automated system

generating these email is not the right

646
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,510
transport for doing that stick save the

00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,880
email for things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that humans will look</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">keep in mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be great for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">interfacing with other people with</font>

653
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:10,950
automation but not great for interfacing

654
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,630
with people who still read through

655
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,130
manually because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just generates more</font>

656
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,410
of those engineer hours who are talking

657
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:18,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">about thank you yeah I think that's</font>

658
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:20,190
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great feedback and perhaps this</font>

659
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,390
might be a good transitional mechanism

660
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,000
that we use to jumpstart<font color="#CCCCCC"> the process</font>

661
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:25,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">caldav obviously is a great way to shift</font>

662
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,480
this over and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's available to people</font>

663
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:29,159
that's feedback we're looking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

664
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,330
and hopefully we'll get some operational

665
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,029
experience with this and we can identify

666
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:33,859
maybe what a better

667
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:35,450
strategy is for this longer term but

668
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:44,449
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that back and consider</font>

669
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:47,029
it you want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about hi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> John Austin</font>

670
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:51,799
google so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had a question about your</font>

671
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:54,109
capacity simulations and I think you

672
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:56,179
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your target</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to run</font>

673
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:59,149
this process within the hour before

674
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:01,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">maintenance have you had any struggles</font>

675
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:03,889
with limiting the runtime of that

676
00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:08,629
simulation and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> a follow-on question</font>

677
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:09,918
is do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any data about how many</font>

678
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:12,228
times you've received the maintenance

679
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,999
notification but it may be in your

680
00:29:12,229 --> 00:29:15,950
architecture in your network it just

681
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:18,259
didn't matter and so in that case what

682
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:21,349
do you do not take any action or still

683
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:23,869
do the drain can you repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

684
00:29:21,349 --> 00:29:29,059
first if I have a problem with that what

685
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:31,759
um so the the capacity simulations do

686
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:33,678
you have a target<font color="#E5E5E5"> max run time on that</font>

687
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,979
and have you experienced any issues

688
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:41,749
keeping it to that max window yeah so

689
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:44,749
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way this works is that we have a I'm</font>

690
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:49,309
your ear out the exact time we know but

691
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:51,649
basically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a baseline of how much</font>

692
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:54,678
fun with the existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> network that we</font>

693
00:29:51,649 --> 00:29:56,209
used normally and with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we assume we</font>

694
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:01,279
assume basically what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to</font>

695
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:03,710
need for any single day we do it with a

696
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,179
couple of days from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment that we</font>

697
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,179
do the simulation to a couple of days

698
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:10,369
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how the one with will look</font>

699
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:12,619
in that time and we take into<font color="#E5E5E5"> account</font>

700
00:30:10,369 --> 00:30:15,968
what maintenance<font color="#CCCCCC"> is happening the time</font>

701
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:19,218
and what fiber cuts we have open<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

702
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:21,049
thanks and the second question was do

703
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:24,049
you track how many times you've received

704
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:25,820
the maintenance notification and whether

705
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:29,599
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you need actually needed to do</font>

706
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:32,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything I don't have a number in</font>

707
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:35,299
general they can go through but we've

708
00:30:32,269 --> 00:30:38,629
had some some important ones which we

709
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:40,429
detected and it saved us from serious

710
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:43,719
problems right but it doesn't happen

711
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:45,700
very often but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

712
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,130
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I guess it's</font>

713
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">safe to assume that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you always drain in</font>

714
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:52,390
response to the maintenance<font color="#CCCCCC"> request</font>

715
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">normally we do yeah and one of the</font>

716
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:57,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we also do one also for</font>

717
00:30:54,159 --> 00:31:01,150
security is that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really we</font>

718
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:03,760
don't what we call hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> drain we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

719
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,890
prioritize the circuits so even if

720
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,580
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> will happen and some we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

721
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:13,360
some issue that we drain more than we

722
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:15,158
should the traffic shouldn't go through

723
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,049
those circuits but in cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font>

724
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:22,840
those circuits they are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used</font>

725
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:25,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you yeah hi John same with</font>

726
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,699
entity my questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email</font>

727
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:29,470
parsing so we get carrier notices all

728
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,960
the time and they have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know HTML</font>

729
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,270
notices plain tex and sometimes

730
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,130
attachments do you guys sanitize that

731
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,070
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it did I like to look to see</font>

732
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">if the dates are correct or because</font>

733
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,970
sometimes they'll put multiple time

734
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:44,530
zones<font color="#E5E5E5"> and but one of the time zones will</font>

735
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:47,850
actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the wrong date or</font>

736
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:49,809
long you know maintenance time with it

737
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:52,030
do you guys like take that information

738
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:54,010
compared to itself to see if they match

739
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,470
the same time then continue on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

740
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,030
you know sanitize the data valid it to

741
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,820
data before you actually proceed with

742
00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:03,070
the actual parsing of it yeah we do

743
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">submit some sanitation but it's hard</font>

744
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,870
right because how do you know that that

745
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:11,260
is actually like if the date is in the

746
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:14,709
past for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we happened well we</font>

747
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:19,330
basically check those kind of things and

748
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:21,130
we allowed but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes for example we</font>

749
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,899
assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a maintenance with a</font>

750
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:25,960
different date it just means that they

751
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:28,809
have rescheduled sometimes we do that so

752
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,039
it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to relate because some some</font>

753
00:32:28,809 --> 00:32:32,200
carriers will just send you a new

754
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:34,419
notification that will overwrite the

755
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,580
last one sometimes they will clarify the

756
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:43,090
resale reschedule sometimes they don't

757
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:45,899
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard really to to know how to</font>

758
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:50,230
parse this even<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a human so yeah</font>

759
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:52,970
gadget thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very</font>

760
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:55,030
much folks really appreciate it

761
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,030
you
