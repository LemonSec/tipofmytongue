<font color="#E5E5E5">makes an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ANA conference different from a</font>

lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other network or connectivity</font>

37
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:00,280
or IT conferences that you might go to

38
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:01,840
first is the attendee demographic you

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,400
know at a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conferences in the</font>

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200

41
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,420
sales folks and you see a lot of product

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,430
folks nanog is a little bit different

43
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:11,350
because the vast majority of attendees

44
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,270
here are working engineers working

45
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,980
network architects working network

46
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:16,870
software developers folks who are

47
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,630
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> producing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network product</font>

everything from<font color="#E5E5E5"> small research networks</font>

50
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,920
and enterprises to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very largest</font>

providers in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog is a little</font>

54
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:35,920
bit different in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other ways</font>

55
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:37,930
most of the other conferences you see

56
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,750
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are commercial in some way</font>

57
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:41,980
they're run for a profit there they're

58
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,320
put together to get the most people

59
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,209
possible in a room nanog is very

60
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">different in that we're we're run by a</font>

dedicated professional staff you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

there's no ownership by a major media

65
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,640
organization and our program here is

they've received a peer review talk and

who are not such a captive audience and

76

this is an annid conference and for

that aren't as big in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of internet</font>

89
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,290
and

other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are doing a little bit</font>

98
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,450
differently is we have a commitment to

99
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:16,250
support new operators and by that we

100
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,389
don't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> startup cable</font>

101
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:21,019
providers really what we're talking

102
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:22,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">about here are new network engineers new</font>

103
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,590
network software developers new network

104
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,870
architects folks coming into our field

105
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:28,429
because the quick poll question for

106
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:31,790
folks who've been in this this field for

107
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">a while you know do you find it</font>

108
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult to recruit new network</font>

109
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,500
engineers yes lots of raised hands it's

110
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:42,020
kind of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pain so one one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

111
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:43,940
that nanog the organization here's

112
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,919
consistently<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our members is how</font>

113
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:47,960
important it is that we support new

114
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,700
operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> who encourage new folks to</font>

115
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,770
come in we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of ways we're</font>

116
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,990
doing that one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nanog</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> college</font>

117

immersion program this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

118
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,200
that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> been started in the past</font>

119
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,229
year and a half or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

120
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we find specific academic programs</font>

121
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:04,430
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely to produce future</font>

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">network engineers and we invite the</font>

124
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,840
educational program to come to nana as

00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,960
part of their studies rather than just a

126

trip you know so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's proven</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

127
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,580
extremely valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

128
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,200

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,270
that super important is yesterday with

part of our commitment to support new

238
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,709
thing that strikes me<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you look at</font>

239
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,260
an event of this quality<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this size</font>

240
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the scale is is the fact that</font>

241
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,600
there's volunteers as Dan mentioned but

242
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,880
I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes without saying that a</font>

243
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of effort goes in behind the scenes</font>

244
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,930
in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of countless hours so please</font>

245
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:13,550
join me<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a round of applause for the</font>

246
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:16,160
volunteers who put this together so for

247
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:18,290
edge connects this is um we were the

248
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">hosts about two years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and as we</font>

249
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:21,819
think about the the partnership<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

250
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:25,880
we've forged over the last few years

251
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:28,790
with nanog certainly ought has happened

252
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,640
since<font color="#CCCCCC"> that last event in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Baltimore in</font>

253
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:34,430
the last two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and short we doubled</font>

254
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,709
our data centers active here in the US

255
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:38,239
and opened our first data center or<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

256
00:10:36,709 --> 00:10:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cusp of opening our first data</font>

257
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,890
center in Europe suffice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say there's</font>

258
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,989
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the marketplace and</font>

259
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:46,970
for a new entrant a new data center

260
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,520
company to come in and have that level

261
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:52,339
of success in that level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of traction is</font>

262
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,410
certainly an indication of things yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

263
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,260
come but<font color="#E5E5E5"> more important than our</font>

264
00:10:54,410 --> 00:11:00,680
partnership with nanog is the fact that

265
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:03,260
quite frankly edge connects as a company

266
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:05,349
as a business our business model our

267
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,180
business plan has several routes and

268
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">principles ingrained in our in our</font>

269
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,689
company that<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite frankly came out of</font>

270
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,589
nanog and the hard work of nanog so a

271
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:17,839
recurring theme that I'll have this

272
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,880
morning is the fact that what you do is

273
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,339
important and what you do does make a

274
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:25,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">tremendous impact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and look no further</font>

275
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,560
than as edge connects continues to go

276
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,260
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marketplace and expanding and</font>

277
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,140
grow and succeed a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our foundation</font>

278
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:37,910
really came from from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard work of</font>

279
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:40,880
nanog so no surprise we're in a

280
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,469
hyper-connected world and and I don't

281
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,060
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell this audience certainly</font>

282
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:48,980
that the growth of the network and the

283
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:53,059
growth around the world of connected

284
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:55,309
devices and humans in 2020 will we get

285
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:58,218
to the point where nearly every human on

286
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:59,749
the planet is connected I don't know but

287
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:02,389
we're certainly going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to approach that</font>

288
00:11:59,749 --> 00:12:04,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">for sure it might be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years later</font>

289
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:08,239
or it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a few years earlier who</font>

290
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:10,848
knows but but certainly the stats are

291
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:13,369
there the growth is there and we've all

292
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:15,469
been experiencing it but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

293
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:17,479
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> important as we think about the</font>

00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:20,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">next chapter the next inflection point</font>

295
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:23,569
and it's less about the numbers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

296
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:28,218
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the scale and as we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:32,539
moment to just reframe look at the

<font color="#E5E5E5">difference in that scale as you look to</font>

300
00:12:32,539 --> 00:12:38,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">the right hand side in 2020 when we</font>

301
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:43,129
think about connected devices it's

302
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:46,388
significant and clearly it's real just

303
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:49,549
last week to give you a stat I saw

304
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:52,339
Netflix here in the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> 300 million</font>

305

306
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:57,259
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right or wrong I think it's</font>

307
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,939
probably conservative some of you may

308
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:01,399
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> better but it's certainly</font>

309
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:03,199
indicative of the fact that here's this

310
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,019
here's a specific service in a specific

311
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:09,709
geography with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> staggering number of</font>

312
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,419
connected devices so the importance and

313
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:14,329
the significance of networks whether

314
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:16,609
it's for our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> personal use or more</font>

315
00:13:14,329 --> 00:13:18,769
importantly and increasingly how we run

316
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:21,169
our day-to-day businesses is alive and

317
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:23,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">well and more importantly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

318
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:32,449
criticality its dependence will become

320
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:36,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago there was a lot of talk and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

discussion a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work from nanog on</font>

322
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:43,339
the edge so to describe the edge to this

323
00:13:40,549 --> 00:13:45,949
audience you already knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but what's</font>

324
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,439
most important here is now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

325
00:13:45,949 --> 00:13:50,868
it into the mainstream community of the

enterprise of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business and more</font>

327
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:55,309
importantly the consumer world so the

328
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:57,289
edge is being talked about and everybody

329
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:59,478
has a definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what the edge is and</font>

330
00:13:57,289 --> 00:14:02,409
what the edge isn't but here are just a

331
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:05,570
few examples but clearly you know well

332
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:09,230
the significance of the edge

333
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:11,480
is here so this requires us as we

334
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,130
reframe and think about the scale<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

335
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,650
forward of connected devices and

336
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,350
connected machines as has been the

337
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,970
charter of nanog for many many years

338
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,000
it's rethinking those architectures

339
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:27,310
design principles and operating

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,660
principles and as applicable reassessing

341
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:32,209
reassessing reevaluating and deploying

342
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:34,459
and if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

343
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,560
application layer type activity that's

344
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:42,620
going on that's changing our<font color="#E5E5E5"> lives as</font>

345
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:44,989
consumers and is business people what

346
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,780
we're also starting to see now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the is</font>

347
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to change the</font>

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:53,900
underlying architecture software-defined

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:56,360
Network network function virtualization

350
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,949
so all of the underpinnings of what is

351
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,810
fueling a lot of growth in the data

352
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,260
center business<font color="#E5E5E5"> with regard to cloud and</font>

353
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:04,579
cloud adoption we're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first inning</font>

354
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,110
two-thirds of enterprises today have

355
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,630
moved less than twenty percent of their

356
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,380
workloads to the cloud the<font color="#CCCCCC"> barriers to</font>

357
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:13,640
entry the barriers to adoption are gone

358
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:15,650
the movement<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the cloud for the</font>

359
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:20,569
enterprise<font color="#CCCCCC"> is real and it will increase</font>

360
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:22,760
in its pace so with that how significant

361
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:25,400
how important is the edge when will

362
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,800
operating parameters that we are used to

363
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,630
in a day-to-day closed wide area network

364
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,150
environment that moves now to a

365
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,800
distributed environment when will the

366
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:36,050
architecture change and need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

367
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,240
as it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already the case but more</font>

368
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:42,020
importantly what does that look like I

369
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,440
think the work done<font color="#CCCCCC"> by nanog will</font>

370
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:48,290
provide us<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer and if you want a</font>

371
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,380
real great example I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of the impact</font>

372
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:53,120
of how the edge is changing over the

373
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:54,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">last few weeks I think many of us saw</font>

374
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:57,230
some of the press releases with regard

375
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:00,050
to the landing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of two new submarine</font>

376
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:04,910
cables in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United States in Virginia</font>

377
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:07,729
Beach where's Virginia Beach it's in the

378
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">mid-atlantic it's kind of somewhat</font>

379
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,780
between New Jersey one of the

380
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,270
traditional landing station sites and

381
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:19,010
Miami so unto itself now operators

382
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:22,670
investors are thinking differently

383
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:26,210
about networks and the this is just I

384
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:28,640
believe the beginning of a increasing

385
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:31,700
level of change that will come most

386
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,370
importantly by defining the new edge in

387
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,860
this case the new edge of submarine

388
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,660
cable landing stations which oh by the

389
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,330
way we'll have some of the largest

390
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:45,050
capacity both from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber count and</font>

391
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:47,210
density<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in a while this</font>

392
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,370
will change traffic patterns this will

393
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:52,430
change buying patterns this will change

394
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:56,120
how we design and operate our networks

395
00:16:52,430 --> 00:17:02,030
over the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years and expect more</font>

396
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:04,150
to come as we like to say the Internet

397
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:08,569
of Things the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everything</font>

398
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:12,680
requires the internet of everywhere as I

399
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:14,869
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you know this growth isn't</font>

400
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,720
inevitable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more importantly the pace</font>

401
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:21,979
and the explosiveness will only increase

402
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:25,630
in the next few years it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be important</font>

403
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,390
that nanog as a group as an entity

404
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:32,840
continue to challenge and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think into</font>

405
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:35,240
the future and show us what those net

00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:37,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">next-generation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> networks should look</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only from an architectural</font>

408
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:42,230
standpoint but from a characteristic

409
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,800
standpoint as I looked across<font color="#E5E5E5"> the agenda</font>

410
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:47,690
it was great to see a lot of the

411
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,760
movement towards simply just thinking

412
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,400
about technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and innovation but</font>

413
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,580
equally including things like business

414
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,000
acumen because certainly the continued

415
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,919
pace and movement of change it's easy

416
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,470
and it's sometimes a very difficult

417
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,600
challenge internally with many

418
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:07,730
organizations to sell a new idea or new

419
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,439
technology if you don't have the

420

<font color="#CCCCCC">business implications whether that's</font>

if you will of nanog to be bring to bear

425
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:26,120
the potent power of not just technical
