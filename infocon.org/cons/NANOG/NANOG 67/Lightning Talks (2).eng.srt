00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,159
later this afternoon all right

00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:27,340
appreciate it thanks good to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go good to</font>

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,590
go hey Michael all right I'm Mike

with the Department of Homeland Security

13
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,059
i want to emphasize at the beginning

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:45,399
that I'm not here representing DHS and

15
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:49,480
I'm only sort of marginally representing

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:51,519
argonne national lab<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I really like to</font>

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,230
say that I'm here as sort of somebody

18
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:55,539
who's really interested in interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

ternet infrastructure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

20
00:00:55,539 --> 00:00:58,780
lucky opportunity to have the right

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,480
background and be in the right place the

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,039
right time to help the federal

23
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,979
government kind of wrap their heads

24
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,170
around the transition from looking at

25
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,090
primarily physical infrastructure to

26
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:12,730
sort of what they're calling cyber

27
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:16,350
infrastructure you'll forgive me for

28
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">using the word cyber it's used really</font>

29
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,710
pretty universally in the federal

30
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:24,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">government and so there's no sort of</font>

the regional resiliency assessment

35
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:35,350
at areas of regional critical

36
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:37,360

and then proceeding into implementation

57
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:29,959
activities so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the study</font>

58
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,730
footprint that we looked at most of you

59
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,910
know the history of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ashburn area</font>

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,730
essentially going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to may east it's</font>

61
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:41,630
been a huge hub of internet traffic

62
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:45,820
thanks largely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know that history</font>

00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:48,590
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as cheap power and a very unique</font>

projections that last year this year

71
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:12,739
we're very interested in the effects of

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:16,700
a physical event in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aspirin area and</font>

73
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,890
how that might cascade into the internet

74
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,140
and into critical infrastructure

75
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:23,269
dependencies that rely on data and

76
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,940
network services both within the region

00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:30,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">and nationally and globally so you know</font>

as many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the people in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room know</font>

00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,680
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the properties</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that make</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet infrastructure so resilient the</font>

81
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,190
fact that it's distributed amongst many

82
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,970
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies the fact that TCP is</font>

83
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:46,340
so resilient this these properties also

84
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:51,440
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to gather hard data</font>

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,540
on this and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I bring up the</font>

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,930
is owned by private companies and

90
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,190
especially right now a lot of the

91
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:05,720
private companies are pretty reluctant

92
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,220
to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information with the federal</font>

94
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:12,560
understandable but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize</font>

95
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,090
that this program that we did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> study</font>

and we have offered<font color="#E5E5E5"> and will continue to</font>

00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:25,370
offer to participants PCI I data

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,830

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,210
detecting the resilience of this

00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:45,419
revealing some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> infrastructure to</font>

109

lawmakers etc so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they understand it</font>

better right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> our sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high-level</font>

findings we looked at IXPs a lot most of

112
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,370
us know there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty huge ixp in the</font>

aspirin area that you know we won't name

114
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,500
the name of but there's a lot of

115
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,199
concerns that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that high XP were to go</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">down there would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know some</font>

118

<font color="#CCCCCC">global</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slowdowns etc but especially</font>

120
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:23,190
looking at locally home content within

121
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,690
the Ashburn Virginia region so as we

122
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,340
conducted<font color="#E5E5E5"> this study somebody brought up</font>

123
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,650
this great analogy of looking at

124
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,289
centralized I XP is sort of a major

125
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:34,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">airport hub you know basically thinking</font>

126
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:37,020
about the effects to global<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

127
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:40,469
traffic if an IXP went down as similar

128
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,780
to if<font color="#CCCCCC"> o'hare you know stop being able to</font>

129
00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:44,580
route traffic it wouldn't stop air

130
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,280
traffic everywhere else in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but</font>

131
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,210
that outage would have sort of ripple

132
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,008
effects to other airports and so we kind

133
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,380
of use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> metaphor and continued on</font>

134
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,570
with that as a way to describe some of

135
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,400
our stakeholders<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you know an IXP</font>

146
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,258
this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to larger internet</font>

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,530
data center infrastructure would enhance

resilience planning one of the big

150
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:36,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came up and most of our data</font>

151
00:06:34,349 --> 00:06:38,639
came out of facilitated discussions

152
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,520
tabletop kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> exercises and</font>

interviews with providers and one of the

issues that came up over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over again</font>

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,860
is during a disaster event data centers

00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:51,860
and particularly content providers

157
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,389
may have resources that they can lend to

158
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,219
disaster recovery options they don't

159
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:59,310
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any easy way to contribute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

160
00:06:56,219 --> 00:07:01,530
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their big concerns is having</font>

161
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,990
a fuel truck rerouted away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a data</font>

162
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,270

163
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,610
an energy provider that may depend on

164
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:10,289
services within that data center those

165
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,789
dependencies aren't well understood by

166
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:16,800
virtually anyone and we would like to

167
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:18,659
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of start asking the right questions</font>

168
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,610
to see how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about those</font>

169
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:23,810
dependencies in a way that doesn't

170
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:27,000
compromise IP but that still allows

171
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,740
disaster recovery efforts to you know

172
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,719
really focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important</font>

173
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,750
elements without you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of taking</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">down a data center that 911 depend on or</font>

175
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,580
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so increasing</font>

176
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:40,229
transparency really we'd like to see a

177
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,580
workshop conducted where we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,859
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the room to talk about</font>

179
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:45,628
these issues and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of decide what the</font>

180
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,520
next steps would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we can</font>

181
00:07:45,629 --> 00:07:53,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">really gather data in a way that</font>

182
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:55,830
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is comfortable with another big</font>

183
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:57,810
issue that came up is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a local law</font>

184
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,419
enforcement in the aspirin area but I

185
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">would assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is generally true</font>

186
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:04,979
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country they really don't</font>

187
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:07,349
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proper training to know how to</font>

188
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:11,490
look for suspicious activity around 50

189
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:15,270
vaults around basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of this sort</font>

190
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,129
of Internet infrastructure and this you

191
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,810
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do there's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

192
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:21,870
complicated issue we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

193
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,150
credentialing but a big part of the

194
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:26,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue that would help is even if law</font>

195
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:30,239
enforcement had access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber routes</font>

196
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:31,680
etc being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to know hey this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

197
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,659
place that we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking for</font>

198
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,909
suspicious activity on a regular basis

199
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:38,539
and this you know this comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as a</font>

200
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,948
very relevant threat in response to

201
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,468
events that have happened in the bay

202
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:45,839
area in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last several years you know</font>

203
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:48,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">there been major</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber cuts that have</font>

204
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,130
been malicious in nature and it's very

205
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,130
hard for law enforcement to track these

206
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,180
things down after they happen so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

207
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:58,019
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

208
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,429
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> again and again and really you know</font>

209
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:02,189
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> running low on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">emphasize as part of these findings you</font>

know my personal interest again you know

not representing DHS but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think there's</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot that this community can do to get</font>

ahead of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues to come to the</font>

00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:16,109
federal<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and say hey here's</font>

219
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:28,649
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really what we're looking for</font>

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:30,779
from these sorts of studies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and last but</font>

221
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:32,790
not least and there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many more</font>

222
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,249
findings in this that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with anyone but data center and content</font>

224
00:09:35,249 --> 00:09:40,009

contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resilience efforts and or</font>

226
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:43,379
communicate criticality during an

00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:49,439
this as well basically if your telecom

pathway into disaster recovery efforts

233
00:09:55,709 --> 00:10:01,888
if you are a real estate data center

234
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:03,420
Colo you may not have that same kind of

235

access and especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> for content</font>

that feature parity right make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

centers and co-located data centers have

that same sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of access and and that</font>

they have tested all of the critical

pleased to say that everything worked

319
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:02,829
for first time so we're issuing an order

how else can you help it's an open

351
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,890
source project so we're always looking

352
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,310
for community review that's a pointer to

353
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:23,890
our wiki or you can find pointers to the

repositories we would like help with

presentation so bear with me here we go

384
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,850
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a private talk whatever you</font>

385
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,340
know who I work for what kind of

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">not about the company i will talk about</font>

389
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,760
in a second which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:07,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation this is really about well</font>

391
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:09,470
us as the community or<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly about</font>

392
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:13,930
my friends as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see in a second</font>

393
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,930
and how we perceive trust and security

394
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:23,410
so for many years as many as 3 i'm not

395
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:27,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">on facebook anymore i left facebook and</font>

396
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:29,840
for various reasons and I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of my</font>

397
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:31,550
friends about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course they</font>

398
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">mocked me for it and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know half of</font>

399
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:36,139
the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> invited anymore and</font>

400
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:40,730
stuff like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do what you do</font>

401
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:43,580
you go back to facebook this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

402
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:45,530
kitten picture by the way so this would

403
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,659
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> all fine in the conversation would</font>

404
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:51,080
come to an end here if that actually

405
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:53,840
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really me because that's not me</font>

406
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,809
it's neither me nor my account

407
00:17:53,840 --> 00:18:00,439
so someone took the courtesy to create

408
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:02,510
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> account and put my name on downloaded</font>

409
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,990
a picture somewhere randomly in the

410
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:09,020
internet edit a couple of informations

411
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,880
or now I actually missed the ayah editor

412
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,970
random informations which were not

413
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:18,919
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> true like my hometown in</font>

414
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:22,490
Austria I did a cat picture not exactly

415
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:25,130
my taste either and invited 20 friends

416
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,380
or at least people from the community he

417
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:29,360
thought they are my friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> this worked</font>

418
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,710
very well and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the seat group does</font>

419
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,789
whatever they do they were all happy

420
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:36,830
that I'm back so you know one friend

421
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:40,940
suggests the next one and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font>

422
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:45,020
suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you end up with x</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 day 170 of</font>

423
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:47,450
them and in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first 150 were actually</font>

424
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,399
reached in like three days so this was a

425
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:54,559
really good bootstrapping process and it

426
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:56,090
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast so now besides the</font>

427
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,940
entertainment value of that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

428
00:18:56,090 --> 00:19:01,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a problem I mean who cares just</font>

429
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:05,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of identity theft left and</font>

430
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:07,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">right nothing big to talk about the</font>

431
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,789
interesting part out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that</font>

432
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:13,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these hundred and seventy</font>

433
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:15,890
literally three of them asked me out of

434
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,600
meant by a text message or email if that

435
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,309
is actually my account and why the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hell</font>

436
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,699
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back I thought you don't</font>

437
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,139
like it anymore um funny enough two of

438
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,789
them actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me so that is a</font>

439
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:31,909
good thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least my own people</font>

440
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen to me and as I have heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

441
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:37,190
and I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the account in a second</font>

442
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:39,470
and 12 people started to chat with that

443
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:42,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">person and asked my a facebook Messenger</font>

444
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,669
inbound is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really you where the</font>

445
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:48,380
person then who is owning their<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter</font>

446
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and right now said yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure so you</font>

447
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:52,039
changed your mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the person idea</font>

448
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,039
yeah you know wanted to come back and

449
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:56,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody really questioned it too much</font>

450
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:58,908
literally no one of the hundred and

451
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,620
seventy so some of them realized

452
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:02,419
afterward that probably something is da

453
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">chi you know it's not exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> style</font>

454
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:07,140
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> I react or it's not my kitten</font>

455
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,120
pictures is a little bit strange

456
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,890
even the one who said afterwards they

457
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,439
were suspicious none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them actually</font>

458
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,210
told me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I was</font>

459
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:21,600
suspicious or you know i defriended you

460
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:24,120
again because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looked like fake i also</font>

461
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,550
have as I was told since yesterday or

462
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,770
two days ago a tinder account now which

463
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:34,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great so if you want to date me this</font>

464
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:37,020
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your chance so besides</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the whole</font>

465
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:39,120
Facebook part as you know Facebook is

466
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,730
used as an authentication for other

467
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,280
applications whenever you actually start

468
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,440
trusting that one you can build<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

469
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,940
and you just you're not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it</font>

470
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:51,060
for facebook you basically use it for

471
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:54,240
everything else which builds on it so

472
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:56,100
this little trust in the beginning where

473
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,830
you actually believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is really the</font>

474
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,480
person and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't really verify at</font>

475
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:05,149
the moment where you get enough people

476
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,980
and I talked with various of my friends

477
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:09,690
so did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know ping came suspicious and</font>

478
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,000
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> most times the answer was one there</font>

479
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:15,060
were already<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 hundred other people so</font>

480
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,860
you know it looked all legitimate so if

481
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,750
you actually get a seat group of a

482
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:21,840
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of people then getting</font>

483
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,270
more and more it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

484
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,639
particular difficult if an<font color="#E5E5E5"> account has</font>

485
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:29,730
created in mass nobody really challenges

486
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:39,360
the ability of it anymore<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all what</font>

487
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:42,450
was needed was my picture so so how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

488
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,429
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you trust me is now actually how much</font>

489
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,460
you trust that account because you know

490
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,620
170 people they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't really be wrong so</font>

491
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever you would do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me on a</font>

492
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:55,320
whatsapp Facebook or any other method of

493
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:57,870
communication you would do now for that

494
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:00,570
person if that is configuring a router

495
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,520
session or you know giving me some NDA

496
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,290
information telling me<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh celery</font>

497
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,670
whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would do you would now do</font>

498
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,409
for that person because you're not

499
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:11,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">touching it anymore if it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

500
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:13,590
the real Christian or not and as

501
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook is also almost social medias</font>

502
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:21,600
also very good and blurring the

503
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:24,880
boundaries between work and private life

504
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,830
as I said whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do for that for</font>

505
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:32,770
me you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do probably over that</font>

506
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:34,330
account as well so I thought it a little

507
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,650
bit about the entertaining value what

508
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:38,168
are you doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that while you make a</font>

509
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:40,809
lightning torque I guess we have a box

510
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:42,460
in that tick in the box and then I

511
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,620
thought what can you actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

512
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:48,309
probably prevent that and you know these

513
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:50,949
aren't random examples the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

514
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:52,928
is probably more what could and again

515
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:55,179
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not about Facebook per se but</font>

516
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:57,460
what could social media or any other

517
00:22:55,179 --> 00:22:59,409
part especially with the ones which are

518
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,020
also the backend authentication and

519
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:05,860
login for other tools what could they

520
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:07,510
actually do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you are you</font>

521
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,020
or that at least your friends can trust

522
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:12,700
you and know this is really the real one

523
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:15,399
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess you could do and what other</font>

524
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:17,409
people do like people<font color="#CCCCCC"> erbium video so</font>

525
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:21,939
you can do verification sometimes they

526
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:23,980
have IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then it's more done against</font>

527
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nth person right where you scan your</font>

528
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:28,990
ID and you have face recognition and all

529
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,399
that kind of stuff like a camera<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you</font>

530
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,549
can just do some out-of-band

531
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:35,590
authentication like a text an email to

532
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:40,830
actually see when your friend someone is

533
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:43,689
that really the person 3ma one of the

534
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:45,370
whatsapp kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> blown chat tools is</font>

535
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:47,890
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> using various levels of</font>

536
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,330
authentication so they do if you're not

537
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,880
authenticated at all you have a little

538
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,220
red dot if at least email and phone

539
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,950
number matches you get it yellow one and

540
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,990
then if you scan the QR code of the

541
00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">other person physically and stand in</font>

542
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">front of the person</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get a little</font>

543
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">green dot so at least you know how much</font>

544
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:06,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can trust that particular friend or</font>

545
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,879
that account if that is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

546
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,529
person so probably this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font>

547
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,690
which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting for us as a</font>

548
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:16,899
community or for the companies to have a

549
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:19,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other part for me or the</font>

550
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:21,850
lesson I learned I guess is now I gotta

551
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:24,309
clean my space it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

552
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:27,189
the domain part so now to prevent that

553
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:29,500
someone else is me I have to now go to

554
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,870
Facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all the others I probably</font>

555
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,580
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want it to go and create an</font>

556
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:34,090
account because hi checking is certainly

557
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,939
much is

558
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,350
yeah sorry much more difficult than

559
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,950
spoofing and creating a new one so i

560
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:44,559
probably have to put my flag in now in

561
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:49,659
strategic tools and logins to prevent

562
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,250
that someone takes them away so lessons

563
00:24:49,659 --> 00:24:53,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">learned I will actually take over that</font>

564
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:56,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook account I know who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

565
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,179
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have my login by the next one or</font>

566
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:59,679
two days at the moment where the kitten

567
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,820
