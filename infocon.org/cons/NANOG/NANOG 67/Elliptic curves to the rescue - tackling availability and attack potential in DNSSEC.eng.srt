00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,820
I'm also a part-time researcher so I

00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,070
have a night job at the university of

on our network so very brief

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:45,429
introduction unless you've been sort of

16
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:47,230
hiding in a closet somewhere you will

17
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:48,909
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen that DNS take has been going</font>

on<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now and deployment has</font>

19
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:55,120
sort of taken off most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big deal</font>

20
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:56,589
the operators have deployed it and lots

21
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,530
of second-level domains are starting to

22
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:01,600
deploy it as well in some teal these

23
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:04,210
more than in others and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm kind of</font>

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,740
proud that in the Netherlands almost

25
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:08,169
fifty percent of domain names are now

26

sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of operational problems that are to</font>

29
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,880
do with response sizes and one is

30
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,800
fragmentation and the other is

31
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,899
amplification<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you a little bit</font>

more detail about those in the next

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,020
couple of slides and the other one is

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:31,750
complex key management involved I'm not

packets from reaching their destination

47
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,250
and we did the study a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

48
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:02,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we found it up to ten percent</font>

00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:08,229
receive fragmented responses and that

51
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,729
results in a degraded years experience

52
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:12,670
because people have to wait longer for

53
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:14,440
the names<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get resolved and there are</font>

54
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,809
already some solutions out there you can

55
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,819
configure your authoritative name server

56
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,190
a little bit differently if you're a DNS

57
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,369
zone operator because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course you are</font>

58
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,709
affected by the

59
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,129
a bad behavior of the resolvers that

60
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:29,780
can't receive the fragment of responses

61
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:32,540
the fallback behavior in resolver

62
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:37,489
software was improved over the years and

63
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:40,609
the RFC that deals with how you transmit

<font color="#CCCCCC">you are aware that our firewalls on the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">asking for big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns responses so what</font>

70
00:02:58,099 --> 00:03:02,420
happens if you turn minimal responses on

71
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:04,430
what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> pays</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off this is a graph for</font>

72
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,048
one of our authoritative name servers we

73
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,180
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of problems when we first</font>

74
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:11,150
deployed the NSA with people being

75
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,560
unable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve names in our zone and</font>

76
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,810
that was mostly due to the large

77
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,849
responses and we change to minimal

78
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,310
responses and as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the average</font>

79
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:22,429
response size from our third age<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

80
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:25,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">servers dropped by about sixty six</font>

81
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:27,680
percent but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if we turn minimal</font>

82
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,720
responses on we still see fragmentation

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,840
and about Oh point one percent of

84
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,139
packets that go over ipv4 the red line

85
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,329
in the bottom graph still get fragmented

86
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:45,109
because they don't fit in a single

87
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:47,780
packet yeah the other problem with the

88
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:49,970
NSA of course and that's been in the

89
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,489
news<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit lately with akamai</font>

90
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:57,560
saying that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now getting abused a</font>

91
00:03:52,489 --> 00:04:00,829
lot for<font color="#E5E5E5"> d dos attacks is that DNS SEC is</font>

92
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,019
a potent amplifier we did a study in

93
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,389
2014 because there were lots of claims

94
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:06,530
out there that the NSA<font color="#E5E5E5"> had this huge</font>

95
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:08,090
problem that you could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for</font>

96
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:10,310
amplification attacks but nobody had

97
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,379
actually measured it at scale and what

98
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,970
we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked at all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NSX</font>

99
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:17,298
<font color="#CCCCCC">signed domains in not condone net and</font>

100
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:19,668
org and a couple of other T of these and

101
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,769
measured what kind of amplification you

102
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:23,330
could achieve with these domains and

103
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,510
what you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the result in this</font>

104
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,039
graph on the left hand side are our sort

105
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">of control group of domains which are</font>

106
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:32,390
not DNS SEC signed and what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

107
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,570
sent in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case this is the data for</font>

108
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,320
any queries we send a two and a half

109
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,540
million domain

110
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,210
names<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were not signed and any query</font>

111
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:42,470
and then the average amplification

112
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:45,080
factor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could achieve is run</font>

113
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:47,960
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 we did the same for two and a</font>

00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">half million DNS excite domains and the</font>

115
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,370
average amplification factor is

116
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:56,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">somewhere around 50 with outliers going</font>

117
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:59,630
up to 180 times so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NSA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a potent</font>

118
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:03,890
amplifier but is there a reason behind

119
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:07,640
this well we argue if the button<font color="#E5E5E5"> helps</font>

120
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:09,710
me oh sorry one<font color="#E5E5E5"> more slide yeah so any</font>

121
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,270
queries we could suppress<font color="#E5E5E5"> right any</font>

122
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,370
queries is something that you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

123
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,620
debugging<font color="#E5E5E5"> your DNS and there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

124
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,320
a draft circulating in the IETF to

125
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:20,600
deprecate the any query in a sensible

126
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,550
way such that you only give a very

127
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,440
minimal response as an authoritative

128
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,480
name server if you receive in any query

129
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,490
but if you do d in a sec you have to

130
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate the keys that you use to</font>

131
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign your zone to other people otherwise</font>

132
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,760
they can't validate your responses and

133
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:37,820
that is done with a specific record type

134
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,710
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns key and unfortunately if you</font>

135
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,620
send all your key material that's going

136
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:44,479
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big response and what this graph</font>

137
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,950
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> you is for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those two and a half</font>

138
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:48,800
million domains for which we did the

139
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:52,130
measurement study almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40% of those</font>

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:55,190
give you an amplification factor of over

141
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,930
23 and the 23 is sort of a magic number

142
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,790
because that is the amplification that

143
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:02,510
you could achieve theoretically if you

144
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:05,210
used classic<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS packets of up to 512</font>

145
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:07,550
bytes and we deem anything that you

146
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,190
reach above that any amplification above

147
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as bad and forty percent of DNS key</font>

148
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:16,850
responses that we got back exceeded this

149
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:20,030
limit and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue that the root cause</font>

150
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:23,630
for this is our essay RSA is the only

151
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:25,010
mandatory algorithm in DNS SEC it is

152
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,590
also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most widely</font>

153
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:31,130
deployed and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> with RSA is</font>

154
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,109
that the keys are large say<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 1024 bit</font>

155
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,180
RSA key<font color="#E5E5E5"> already gives you hundred and</font>

156
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:37,790
twenty eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> byte signatures and every</font>

157
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,280
DNS response may include several

158
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:42,080
signatures because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

159
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,580
record types in there or because you

160
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,289
have additional information in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

161
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:48,710

162
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,000
then if you go to 2048-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSA the</font>

163
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">signature size double</font>

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,640
because the key size doubles and you may

165
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,840
have 256 bytes signatures in your packet

166
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,520
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have two</font>

167
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,359

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:05,210
classic DNS packet with data another

169
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,840
issue with RSA is that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep</font>

170
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:11,330
growing these<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keys there I think there's</font>

171
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,239

172
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:18,560
session tomorrow the root<font color="#CCCCCC"> zone is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

173
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:22,700
to migrate its zone sign zone sign in

174
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,770
key size<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 2048-bit RSA and the key</font>

175
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,780
signing key is already at that but the

176
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,219
majority of signatures in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS song</font>

177
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,520
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done with the zone signing key</font>

178
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,290
so if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root moves to 2048-bit zone</font>

179
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,870
tiny keys that means all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> signatures</font>

180
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,330
that you get back on the TLD referrals

181
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:42,470
you get will also have larger signatures

182
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:45,880
in there so is there no solution to this

183
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,800
problem well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there is because</font>

184
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are good alternatives to RSA and</font>

185
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:56,060
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious one is to use elliptic</font>

186
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:57,830

187
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:00,410

188
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,460
smaller keys and much more cryptographic

189
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,580
strength as the slide shows you a

190
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:11,570
256-bit ECC group is<font color="#E5E5E5"> equivalent in</font>

191
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:14,440
strength to 3072 bit RSA but the

192
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,409
signatures are four times<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller than</font>

193
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,200
2048-bit RSA signatures and actually it

194
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:23,600
turns out that ecdsa which is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

203
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:50,300
it if you go to icon meetings or if you

204

go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF then you will see people</font>

206

207
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,040
there is one large operator that has

208
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,990

213
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:12,200
there are additional algorithms that are

214
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:15,110
currently getting standardized for use

215
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,060
in DNS SEC they're called<font color="#CCCCCC"> ed DSA and</font>

216
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:21,260
they have some even more<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorable</font>

217
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:25,729
properties in terms of mainly key size

218
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,890
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> transmit it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across the wire so</font>

219
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,920
what we wanted to do was to measure the

220
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:34,460
impact of if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we switch DNS SEC from</font>

221
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,140
using RSA to using a cc overnight what

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen what would the impact be on</font>

223
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:41,420
operations so we revisited all those

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,130
domains income net and org that are

225
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,729
signed we looked at in the amplification

226
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:49,840
study and we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to estimate what the</font>

227
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:53,180
effect of switching to ECC would be and

228
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:56,000
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very favorable if we go</font>

229
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,189
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the DNS key response sizes then</font>

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,530
if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this figure from right to</font>

231
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,530
left then the current<font color="#CCCCCC"> situation is the</font>

the top 10% of<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS key responses that we</font>

in the minimal MTU<font color="#E5E5E5"> size for ipv6 and</font>

237
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:26,150
round about 1% don't fit in the minimal

238
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:28,640

239
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:31,699
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet which is what you see for</font>

240
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv4 mostly but then if you would switch</font>

241
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:38,660
to ecdsa then even if you use ecdsa with

242
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:40,520
a conservative scheme so you don't

243
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,439
change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns tech mechanics you just</font>

244
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:46,250
change what algorithm you used to sign

245
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,620
the zone then your responses will become

246
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,020
a lot smaller<font color="#CCCCCC"> and all of them will be</font>

247
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:55,460

248
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:57,920
even into the minimal ipv6 empty you and

249
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:02,570
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do even better because the keys</font>

250
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,699
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ECC are a lot stronger you could</font>

251
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,560
choose to sign your zone with a single

252
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,870
key rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the current scheme</font>

253
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,939
which has a dual<font color="#CCCCCC"> setup where you have a</font>

254
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,500
key signing key that only signs your key

255
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,990
setting you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a zone signing key that</font>

256
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,540
signs that the names in your zone you

257
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,700
could move to a single key

258
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,819
in which case you could fit your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns key</font>

259
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:28,240
response in a classic<font color="#CCCCCC"> 512-byte dns</font>

260
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:31,660
packet so the implication is of course

261
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:35,020
that amplification will be way less the

262
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:37,150
the red bar at the bottom shows you the

263
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,740
span of amplification that we saw with

264
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,829
the original measurement that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did and</font>

265
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we switch to ecdsa obviously</font>

266
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:46,810
amplification becomes less<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as I said</font>

267
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:52,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">we could argue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that any should be banned</font>

268
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:54,510
anyway if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amplification</font>

269
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:59,920
that you could achieve with<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS key</font>

270
00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:02,590
responses as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said any we can block</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

271
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,469
key we need to do DNS SEC then the

272
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:08,110
takeaway is that if you switch to ecdsa

273
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,020
or EDSA then<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS key amplification</font>

274
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">Israel is no longer a big issue because</font>

275
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:16,180
you cannot achieve more amplification

276
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:18,160
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS key responses for this</font>

277
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,829
algorithm than you could with a classic

278
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:27,120
500 of white DNS packet and I think

279
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:30,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good news and maybe if we go to</font>

280
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">ecdsa or a dds a based signatures we</font>

281
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,870
could go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to classic 500 DNS because</font>

282
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:38,890
we also looked at the bread and butter

283
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:41,160
of DNS so the a and quad a responses and

284
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,170
what you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

285
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,400
would fit in a classic fiber in 12 x

286
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,439
packet which if you were to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use RSA</font>

287
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:55,240
together with DNS SEC would not be the

288
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:59,740
case and there is of course always one

289
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:03,940
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem unfortunately the</font>

290
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:06,010
standardized ECC schemes in DNS SEC can

291
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,210
be a lot slower when you validate the

292
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,860
signatures and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

293

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they mentioned in the</font>

bit RSA signatures<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what we did in</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> table is compared eval</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">dation time for 1024 bit RSA signatures</font>

303
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,729
to the smallest<font color="#E5E5E5"> ECC group that that was</font>

304
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:42,250
standardized which is P 256 and if you

305
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:44,650
use current software so current<font color="#E5E5E5"> openssl</font>

306
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,930
to do the validation validation of a

307
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:49,900
single elliptic curve signature can be

308
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:52,180
up to 26 times slower<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a 1024 bit</font>

309
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:56,500
RSA signature and that might be a

310
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:59,400
problem because you might be pushing the

311
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:04,630
effort towards the edges of the network

312
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:07,209
so right now validating DNS SEC

313
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:09,100
signatures is not an impediment for DNS

314
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,020
resolvers if validating resolvers can

315
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,850
run on just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same kind of hardware</font>

316
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:15,280
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were running your DNS resolver</font>

317
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:17,830
on before but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> would happen if you</font>

318
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,660
switch all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nsx over to elliptic</font>

319
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:22,780
curve cryptography can we still do that

320
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,730
or is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU penalty on resolvers going</font>

321
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,810
to be so extensive that we can no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer</font>

322
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:28,060
do that and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade our</font>

323
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:30,579
resolvers and we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find out</font>

324
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:35,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">before we recommend people deploy this</font>

325
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:38,200
at scale on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so what we did</font>

326
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">we studied resolver behavior and we</font>

327
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,820
looked if we could predict how many

328
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,130
signatures we have to validate and what

329
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,770
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cpu we would need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font>

330
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:52,290
validation what you see in the picture

331
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:54,610
here is the chain from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS resolver</font>

332
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:55,839
towards authoritative name servers and

333
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of signatures it needs to</font>

334
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,290
validate so clients<font color="#E5E5E5"> we took completely</font>

335
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,780
out of the picture because the cache

336
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,480
takes care of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

337
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,459
is what kind of responses does<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DNS</font>

338
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,080
resolver get back and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

339
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,850
picture from top to bottom you see that

340
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,839
the DNS resolver will send a query to

341
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:15,790
authoritative name servers and not all

342
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,300
authoritative name servers will respond

343
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:21,550
so we look at that factor first<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

344
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,819
number one the second thing we look at

345
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:27,520
is which fraction of responses contain

346
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,770
signatures because not all the domains

347
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,130
are DNS SEC signed so we need to figure

348
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many signatures we get in anyway</font>

349
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:38,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we measure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the average</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

350
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:40,930
signatures / signed response and finally

351
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,600
we look at which signatures the resolver

352
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,050
actually needs to validate because if

353
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,120
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Val</font>

354
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:48,880
the signature before or if there is no

355
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,529
chain of trust the resolver doesn't have

356
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:56,170
to validate the signatures so it doesn't

357
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">expand CPU cycles doing that what we did</font>

358
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">was we measured this on production</font>

359
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:02,709
traffic so certain it is a medium-sized

360
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,420
network operator we have about 1.2

361
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:06,099
million end users on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and we</font>

362
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:08,740
operate resolvers for these people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

363
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,329
what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we took</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic that</font>

364
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">is flowing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> towards one of our production</font>

365
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:16,359
resolvers and we sent that traffic to an

366
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,510
instrumented DNS resolver and what we do

367
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,760
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> we measure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of outgoing</font>

368
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:23,649
queries we instrument a resolver to

369
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,810
measure how many signatures<font color="#E5E5E5"> it validates</font>

370
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:28,480
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that we try to predict what</font>

371
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:34,630
happens if we switch it over to elliptic

372
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:37,959
curve cryptography and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we observed all</font>

373
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:40,120
of this behavior for the picture that we

374
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,670
had with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ditches one two three so</font>

375
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:45,310
oldest the various variables that are in

376
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,990
there and what you the takeaway from

377
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:51,310
this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that it's mostly linear</font>

378
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,870
behavior so to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example diagram</font>

379
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:58,029
number one on the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> and left side</font>

380
00:16:52,870 --> 00:17:01,300
shows you that the number of responses

381
00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:03,220
that come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back for every query that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

382
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,188
resolver sends to towards authoritative

383
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,419
name servers on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and it</font>

384
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:11,770
turns out that about ninety percent of

385
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:13,150
queries that an authority that the

386
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:16,720
resolver sent out to authoritative name

387
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:18,490
servers get a response<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because this</font>

388
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:24,189
is mostly linear we can use this to

389
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:27,040
predict future signature validations so

390
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:30,040
we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to evaluate two scenarios and</font>

391
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,409
the first scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for current DNS</font>

392
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">SEC deployment if we switch that to ECC</font>

393
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,030
overnight what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen well it</font>

394
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,250
turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that on a moderately busy</font>

395
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,440
resolver and our busiest resolver

396
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:46,929
processes around 20,000 queries per

397
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:49,480
second we require about 150 signature

398
00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:52,390
validations per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is</font>

399

<font color="#CCCCCC">easily doable on modern hardware the CPU</font>

400
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:57,940
won't sweat if you do that however what

401
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,178
if dns egg<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes you</font>

402
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,419

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolvers in that case and we wanted</font>

406
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">to study a worst-case scenario and the</font>

407
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,289
worst-case scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where popular</font>

408
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,210
domains and we measured what popular

409
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:22,750
domains are so let's say google com

410
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,970
deploy DNS SEC first right<font color="#E5E5E5"> because that</font>

411
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,529
means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the majority of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> responses</font>

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">is popular you this is a plot of the</font>

415
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,899
popularity of a query name so how many

416
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,509
queries we see for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it versus ranking and</font>

417
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:45,939
popularity and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see is that</font>

418
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:47,740
his disease was called a zip or a long

419
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,409
tail distribution and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

420
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:54,370
the most popular domains are responsible

421

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vast majority of queries and</font>

422
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:59,229
this is a log-log scale so it becomes a

423
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,269
line but if you plot this it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

424
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:06,669
a curve<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a very steep drop-off</font>

425
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:09,519
towards the end and we looked at two

426
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,110
kinds of DNS resolver software to see if

427
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:14,320
we could predict what the impact would

482
00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:44,690
won't struggle with be 256 so again the

483
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:49,610
takeaway is we can safely switch to ECC

484
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:51,710
without killing resolvers so what does

485
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean well I hope I show to you that</font>

486
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,760
twitching to ECC is highly beneficial

487
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:58,699
and tackle some problems that we have in

488
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:01,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">the NSF and both amplification and</font>

489
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:03,980
fragmentation are a result of DNS SEC

490
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,830
responses being much larger than classic

491
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:08,360
DNS responses but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we go to elliptic</font>

492
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:11,570

493
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:16,760

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:24,269

497
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:27,749
resolvers is well within reason in there

498
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:29,700
impro many improvements being made to

499
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:32,029

00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:39,149
contributed an improvement to openssl

00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:43,019
that speeds it up by about a factor of

four there are still some open issues

513
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,049
that twenty percent don't support it and

514
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:13,289
that's mostly due to intellectual

515
00:23:10,049 --> 00:23:15,839
property fears some linux distributions

516
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:20,549
such as redhead in older versions do not

517
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:22,049
include elliptic curve cryptography that

518
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,759
they were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get sued because of</font>

519
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:26,839
intellectual property on elliptic curves

520
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:32,279
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunately all modern releases</font>

521
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:35,879
support ECC so what would it mean for

522
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:37,440
you as operators well what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say</font>

523
00:23:35,879 --> 00:23:39,359
is DNA sick deployment currently is

524
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,609
around about<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of domains</font>

525
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,859
worldwide so that means ninety-seven

526
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:46,468
percent of domains are not yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> d NSX</font>

527
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:48,658
signed and if you're planning to deploy

528
00:23:46,469 --> 00:23:52,409
DNS SEC then my recommendation would be

529
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:54,389
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go with RSA sign with ecdsa p 256</font>

530
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:58,129
or if you're waiting a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

531
00:23:54,389 --> 00:24:00,718
go with one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ed dsl algorithms and</font>

532
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:03,059
if you have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> existing deployment you</font>

533
00:24:00,719 --> 00:24:07,349
should start thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> switching to</font>

534
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:09,479
ecdsa unfortunately that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not trivial</font>

535
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:11,579
because it requires you to do something

536
00:24:09,479 --> 00:24:13,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is called an algorithm roll over I</font>

537
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:15,239
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to go to the details</font>

538
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:19,099
look up the RFC it gave me a headache

539
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:21,629
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing this in 2017 so</font>

540
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:23,279
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll post a series of blog</font>

541
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:25,699
entries about that that will make life

you operate the in estrus over so if

544
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,169
you're a large network operator you

545
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:35,099
operate the NS resolvers for your

546
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:36,839

or support

549

open the floor for questions like

572
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:44,610
Sinatra yes net a nice talk thanks for

573
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:46,170
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one other thing you're</font>

574
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:49,699
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to look at as a signers</font>

575
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,990
whether your registrar supports ecdsa

576
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,940
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there a lot of registrar's</font>

577
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:56,370
out there that do things like common net

578
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,440
but they still don't support DNS SEC at

579
00:25:56,370 --> 00:26:01,129
all but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that do</font>

580
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,990
don't support the elliptic curve

581
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:05,790
algorithms unfortunately there are three

582
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,130
or four or do I know Google domains does

583
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:10,680
and godaddy those are just the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

584
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,630
know that do support it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you have to</font>

585
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,150
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> careful with that as well yeah that's</font>

586
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,220
that's actually an excellent point we

587
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">just submitted a paper about that</font>

588
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:20,690
particular issue to a conference and

589
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:23,100
unfortunately I wasn't able to include

590
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,930
those results but it's an excellent

591
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">point yes your registrar needs to</font>

592
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:31,680
support the algorithm which you sign

593
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,390
with and for instance<font color="#CCCCCC"> for cloudflare we</font>

594
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,500
see that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually hampering</font>

595
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:39,780
adoption so about from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

596
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:41,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">head forty percent of the domains that</font>

597
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,320
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> signed with their surface don't</font>

598
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:45,930
have a full secure delegation because

599
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,700
the registers don't support ecdsa

600
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:50,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">delegation so it's an excellent point if</font>

601
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,740
you sign check for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

602
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,809
Ryan<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ryan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rotten conversent what is the</font>

603
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,970
failure mode when resolvers don't have a

note version of<font color="#CCCCCC"> open SSL or their crypto</font>

605
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,190
library that supports ECC validation the

606
00:27:01,659 --> 00:27:05,139
failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> mode in that case is that they</font>

607
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,779
don't validate the signature and you

608
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:10,149
will get a response without the

609
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:11,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">so-called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ad bit set so you will still</font>

610
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:13,928
get a valid response<font color="#E5E5E5"> it won't be treated</font>

611
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:21,029
as bogus but the signatures won't be

612
00:27:13,929 --> 00:27:21,029
validated either any other questions

613
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:26,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you very much for your time</font>
