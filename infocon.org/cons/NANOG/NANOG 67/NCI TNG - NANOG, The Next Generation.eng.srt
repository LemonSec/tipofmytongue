2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,540
and Dave<font color="#CCCCCC"> Temkin to host a panel</font>

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:15,309
discussion about what is near not doing

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,520
to develop a next generation of network

5
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:35,280
operators and what could we be doing

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:35,280

so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a we're going to talk about</font>

8
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:58,900
basically NCI so that was the larger how

9
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,980
we framed this talk originally but we

10
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,180
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would also be</font>

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,949
interesting to talk a little bit about

12
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,170
the hackathon and that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just had</font>

yesterday was a great sort of proof

point about where those skills need to

be I think that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a little</font>

start of that process absolutely and you

130

<font color="#CCCCCC">know as you know from my previous talk</font>

to bolster what Dan said is nanog needs

134
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,530
to become effectively where people who

137
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,750
and to socialize and use this

138

environment as the hub for that much

139
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,740
less focus on hey we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

day what is really our mission here is

144
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:43,830
to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowledge and it's fun to hear</font>

00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,669
out here I'm not the academic I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

147
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">one who hated high school in the stang</font>

148
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:54,490
hold that I could be done<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over with</font>

149
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:56,050
afterwards and so I don't think about

150
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in the same way that that</font>

151
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:02,640
academics tend to butt in starting the

152
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,260
NCI program I saw that there was a huge

153
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,659
gap that we could fill in bringing

154
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,400
people from that community into this

155
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:13,720
program not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only can we help them learn</font>

156
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:16,000
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us learn a lot too so it</font>

157
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,000
was interesting here that the sum of the

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,260
NCI students participated in the

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,880
hackathon yesterday heard that they

160
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,580
started kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the sidelines and</font>

161
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,170
then work their way in as they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

162
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,550
comfortable many of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

163
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,550
communication students so they're not

164
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,740
coders but the hackathon is designed to

165
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:35,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">give everyone basically the ability to</font>

166
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,970
contribute in some meaningful way we

167
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,860
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is a big part of the</font>

168
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,930
future right there are various different

169
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,800
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can use programs like the</font>

170
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:47,620
hackathon to continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow the</font>

171
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,490
educational mission in a log so I would

172
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:54,840
ask maybe Jesse even though you know

173
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:57,730
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> your long since out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of undergrad</font>

174
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,729
why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think NCI is important why is</font>

175
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:03,490
it important to you so I can I can I can

176
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">channel what I can repeat what I'm going</font>

177
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:08,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> call out mr. dindi sitting right in</font>

178
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,140
front of me when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> first came to nanog I</font>

179
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,640
was like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I was I was I thought</font>

180
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,890
I was pretty good at computer science

181
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,690
when I was an undergrad and I came and I

182
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,430
saw some presentation I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> holy</font>

183
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,160
crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea what these guys are</font>

184
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,170
saying and I had lunch with Greg at the

185
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,730
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my nano and I was like and he was</font>

186
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,740
like you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to treat you</font>

187
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,270
like we treat any fresh out of college

188
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,250
we know you're a grad student fancy

189
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,710
fancy great good but we're gonna treat

190
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,030
you like any any fresh out of out of out

191
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:36,660
of undergrad student we're going to like

192
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,620
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of baby walk you through</font>

193
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,839
operations mechanics we're going to have

194
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:43,120
to like teach you like how to translate

195
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,280
your your technical knowledge of some of

196
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,870
the of some of like basic algorithms to

197
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,910
how those play out and where those break

198
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,130
and widows don't so to me it's

199
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,000
extraordinarily important because

200
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:54,150
because it's it's a body of knowledge

201
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,470
that's just is not conveyed in

202
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,720
traditional computer science programs

203
00:08:56,470 --> 00:09:00,499
and I'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your response to</font>

204
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,549
this given that you're developing your

205
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,429
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with a program that's</font>

206
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:06,228
actually trying to correct that we are

207
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:08,449
really trying we try to give a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

208
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:11,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">hands-on experience we're still</font>

209
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:13,639
theoretically based we try to give

210
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:16,099
hands-on experience bring the students

211
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">to as many conferences as possible given</font>

212
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:20,929
the many outside experiences but still

213
00:09:18,229 --> 00:09:23,869
we hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> from them after they go out it's</font>

214
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:25,809
a shocker the first year they didn't

215
00:09:23,869 --> 00:09:28,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">touch enough they didn't play enough</font>

216
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:30,799
there there's a lot more to learn at a

217
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,629
different level although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will tell you</font>

218
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,299
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> after they've been out in the field</font>

219
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:38,359
for four or five years they'll say I do

220
00:09:35,299 --> 00:09:41,389
miss the academic stimulation that I got

221
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:45,049
in college interesting I'm Kevin you

222
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:47,449
know you've had I think over 30 students

223
00:09:45,049 --> 00:09:49,669
come through here now including ones

224
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:51,348
that are here now at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting what</font>

225
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:54,589
what are the takeaways what do you think

226
00:09:51,349 --> 00:09:56,089
really first first answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same</font>

227
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,739
question which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why is it important to</font>

228
00:09:56,089 --> 00:10:01,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and then second what do you feel</font>

229
00:09:57,739 --> 00:10:03,349
your students have gotten out of it sure

230
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:06,679
so why it's important to me there

231
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:09,079
there's a couple pieces there the first

232
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:11,720
one is I get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring my students here</font>

233
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:13,848
which bringing them to be in a room with

234
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:18,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">900 other network professionals and</font>

235
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:20,689
socialize with them is great for me what

236
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:23,720
the students don't know they'll know now

237
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:26,719
but all the people they talked to come

238
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,779
back and tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that talk went they</font>

239
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,059
give me feedback real-time about what

240
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:35,629
the good things were what the gaps were

241
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:38,809
it allows me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cater my teaching style</font>

242
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:44,149
from semester to semester to meet to

243
00:10:38,809 --> 00:10:48,379
fill those gaps so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I love that the next</font>

244
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:52,129
part is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> did well I hope my boss</font>

245
00:10:48,379 --> 00:10:54,470
doesn't hear this actually but I don't

246
00:10:52,129 --> 00:10:56,239
want to work as much right I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

247
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,249
work less I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to retire</font>

248
00:10:56,239 --> 00:11:02,179
eventually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the best way that we</font>

249
00:10:58,249 --> 00:11:04,519
can make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happens</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for me and</font>

250
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:06,889
for the rest of you is to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

251
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:08,989
pipeline is full to make sure that we we

252
00:11:06,889 --> 00:11:11,180
have the next generation of architects

253
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:14,750
and engineers and operators to

254
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,760
to work through work on our networks so

255
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,250
that's what I get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and what's</font>

256
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:21,830
important to me what the students get

257
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:25,850
out of it is is a lot of stuff they get

258
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:29,090
exposure to all of these tracks and

259
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:30,890
talks and a lot of smart people present

260
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:34,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">company excluded talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about really</font>

261
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:37,400
smart things and really cool things and

262
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:40,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that's that's super important</font>

263
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:43,880
and they can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that elsewhere</font>

264
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:46,940
but they get get that here the second

265
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,060
piece they get is they get exposure to

266
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:52,730
all these folks so they get to network

267
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,319
live people<font color="#E5E5E5"> networking with real people</font>

268
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:56,360
that know what they're talking about and

269
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,220
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is by far the most</font>

270
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,770
interesting piece for the students is

271
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people networking aspect</font>

272
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,220
learning how to do it and then actually

273
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">making those industry contacts can I ask</font>

274
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:11,210
a question though and ask a question is

275
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:13,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that networking productive so are they</font>

276
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,850
are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting jobs based on this and</font>

277
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:19,280
they getting internships are they you

278
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,300
know are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we doing it right in terms of</font>

279
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,490
making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both you know the</font>

280
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:29,050
regular nanog attendees who we need

281
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:31,700
people and the NCI folks who need jobs

282
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,930
are we making that match properly or is

283
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,480
that something we still need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on</font>

284
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:38,089
I think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always make it better but</font>

285
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,030
I have gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> really positive feedback</font>

286
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,940
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the all the students that have come</font>

287
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:45,260
through here<font color="#CCCCCC"> before I think I don't know</font>

288
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,250
if it's a hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

289
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,990
pretty close to a hundred percent

290
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,840
placement rate I know several people

291
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:52,310
were hired directly from interactions

292
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:56,690
that occurred at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last couple of</font>

293
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:58,400
nanog great you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would say to</font>

294
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,920
hire<font color="#CCCCCC"> people smarter than you I'll have</font>

295
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> include that my self assessment for</font>

296
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,790
this here yeah figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what went</font>

297
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,280
wrong there no actually you you are

298
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:12,849
you're you're right which is my opinion

299
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is your hiring effectively to keep</font>

300
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,860
people in them you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to keep people</font>

301
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">in that hiring pipeline right we want</font>

302
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,180
there should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an oversupply of people</font>

303
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,160
right not a not that not that

304
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">competition is not helpful for all of us</font>

305
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,880
as employees of companies but you want

306
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to pick the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right person for</font>

307
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,520
the right job and if we continue to

308
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,110
invest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> developing those people will</font>

309
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,120
get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a point where we can feel like</font>

310
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,220
that pipeline is full<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think it</font>

311
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,780
is today en i was going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you it is</font>

312
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,330
not right now it feels like there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

313
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,220
any slack in the hiring pipeline right

314
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,580
and so from your perspective as an

315
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:50,530
employer why is why is NCI important to

316
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,780
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I think it's important because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

science major at a great school um not

320
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,200
even considering network engineering

321
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:07,050
it's it's not the hot thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's its</font>

322
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:10,330
infrastructure well she yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

323
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,250
there is some of that oh and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

324
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:13,690
shouldn't gloss over that not I mean

325
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,580
Patrick you said it as a joke but it's

326
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:17,890
true and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have to think about the</font>

327
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,930
diversity aspect of it right stem in

328
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:21,520
general is still an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue for forgetting</font>

329
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,530
women and minorities in the stem is

330
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">still an issue and I would hope that</font>

331
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:28,900
nanog will continue what will continue

332
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:30,580
to play an evolving role in helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

333
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,380
fix that which<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem starts</font>

334
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,000
before or long before everyone is in

335
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,470
this room but hopefully by getting

336
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">involved earlier in the process maybe</font>

337
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,740
help it along and that's a great<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

338
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">is this is a pipeline problem the</font>

339
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,310
pipeline problem starts somewhere around

340
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,170
middle school where a lot of folks are

341
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:47,020
discouraged from doing anything

342
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:49,089
technical and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time those kids who</font>

343
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,790
are technical get into college if they

00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,250
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something in CS or electrical</font>

engineering or related field what is hot

346
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:58,870
right now what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our huts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right now our</font>

internet of things are certain sorts of

349
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,369
devices what is not hot as this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

350
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,640
hate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that I don't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

351

downer but most of the kids who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

352
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:15,040
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the young adults look at this</font>

field and a they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't understand it</font>

354
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,640
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly do not think there's a</font>

355
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,220
software engineering element to it and

356
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,600
of cour

357
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,029
there's now a huge software engineering

358
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:26,209
element they do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this is</font>

359
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:28,250
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a interesting field</font>

360
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,779
that they can grow in that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

361
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,819
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money they want to make in</font>

362
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:34,459
and one of the important things<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

363
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:36,019
NCI and about the hackathon about all

364
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,388
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> programs that Nana's should do</font>

365
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,790
around this is it's a way to reach out

366
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:42,290
to those folks who<font color="#CCCCCC"> have no exposure</font>

367
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,540
whatsoever to infrastructure

368
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:46,519
professionals none they've never met one

369
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,050
there their computer science majors

370
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">their double e's they've never met</font>

371
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:52,128
anyone in our field ever during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

372
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:54,050
entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> time they're in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> school it's a way</font>

373
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:55,639
to reach out to them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say this is an</font>

374
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,769
option maybe it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what you think</font>

375
00:15:55,639 --> 00:16:00,110
there's an entree here it's very

376
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:03,740
interesting work there's a strong demand

377
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:06,620
for highly trained folks so why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

378
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:10,550
come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give it a try and if there's</font>

379
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:12,319
one thing NCI does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's to say hey this</font>

380
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:13,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a viable option which is why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

381
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:16,310
it should be expanded pretty

382
00:16:13,819 --> 00:16:18,319
significantly past telecom programs

383
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:21,829
where most of the folks already know

384
00:16:18,319 --> 00:16:25,009
this is an option into you know straight

385
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:27,138
CS programs and EE programs there's a

386
00:16:25,009 --> 00:16:29,149
connection script grab a question from

387
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:32,000
the floor I thanks Eve guerrilla<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris</font>

388
00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:34,009
from cisco i joined a very old boy

389
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,709
network and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good data</font>

390
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:38,930
point that came out recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> Harvard</font>

391
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:41,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Business School review said that over</font>

392
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:44,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">forty-five percent of women in</font>

393
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:47,989
engineering drop out and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for</font>

394
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:50,660
that dropout is the lack of mentoring so

395
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:53,689
I do feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you do want women to</font>

396
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:56,509
grow in this area it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually up to</font>

397
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:58,699
the men to help mentor women more

398
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:00,769
completely agree and as I look around<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

399
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:03,219
the stage I realized I is the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

400
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:06,530
put this panel together I messed up

401
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jessie I was about to suggest that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a one</font>

402
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,559
of the things that going building all

403
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:12,380
the dance comment is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one vector</font>

404
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:14,539
for that so Dave Dave sent me cast me

405
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,919
back to my days as an undergrad one

406
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,839
thing to my undergrad Clemson did a lot

407
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,870
was they they um they had they had a

408
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,549
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> strong co-op program were you where</font>

409
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:24,198
you did of well you did for de where you

410
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:25,280
for your<font color="#CCCCCC"> four-year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> program became five</font>

411
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,260
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you were encouraged to do</font>

412
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,928
three co-op sessions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where one</font>

413
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:32,430
vector for growing the NCI program might

414
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:35,820
be to use nano<font color="#CCCCCC"> ghus kind of like</font>

415
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:37,650
the clearinghouse<font color="#CCCCCC"> for access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to these to</font>

416
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,360
the variety of companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could done</font>

417
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:40,410
could then you could then say<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah these</font>

418
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the companies that are looking for</font>

419
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:44,610
co-ops in this domain so it both

420
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,710
advertises the domain as well as gets

421
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:49,199
folks experience so you can try before

422
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,910
you buy and you can also do some

423
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,370
training on the job and have them report

424
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,080
out it's an interesting idea one of the

425
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,469
things that it's been pretty clear is

426
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,820
that you know this isn't actually a

427
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:04,530
co-op heavy field and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case in</font>

428
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:06,000
CS in general it's an internship heavy

429
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,970
field whereas traditional engineering

430
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,190
disciplines are more co-op it's it's a

431
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,480
lot easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a co-op you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I was</font>

432
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,370
a mechanical injury as an undergraduate

433
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,910
it's much easier to be a co-op there

434
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,350
than it is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a co-op here and so</font>

435
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,640
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something we've talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

436
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,209
can't figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

437
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,980
particular piece off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ground I think</font>

438
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,350
things like having an internship hiring

439
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,650
fair however think things like that some

440
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,760
way to you know there's a fear and I'll

441
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,980
just come right on the stage to see if

442
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:37,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">people agree or not there's a fear on</font>

443
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,420
the board<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we are too friendly</font>

444
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:41,580
with recruiters the companies will stop

445
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,040
sending people to nanog because they

446
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,449
think that you know recruiters there to

447
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,790
hire people so they'll stop setting

448
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,120
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I have the opposite</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> view</font>

449
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:53,460
and I see people nodding I the opposite

450
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,750
view<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if we get enough you know NCI</font>

451
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,460
folks young folks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something</font>

452
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:59,130
like an internship hiring fair an

453
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,560
entry-level hiring fair we deliberately

454
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:03,870
bring recruiters out to do that I think

455
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,250
it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from being a scary endeavor to</font>

456
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:07,770
being something maybe a little bit more

457
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,360
positive but I you know folks want to

458
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,830
rock the mic and comment on that it

459
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,780
would be playing it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cartoon</font>

460
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,020
whatever it's like from<font color="#E5E5E5"> The New Yorker I</font>

461
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:19,139
think of basically you know what if we

462
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,389
invest in someone and they leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

463
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,430
right we invest money in their education

464
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:26,040
in their future and they leave us<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

465
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:28,020
then the you know the counter is well

466
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:31,950
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't invest yeah what are we</font>

467
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,389
left with in the center<font color="#CCCCCC"> here one one</font>

468
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:36,930
quick comment hi my name is joel crouse

469
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:38,280
skyward for kensic I've observed that

470
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,900
especially for companies that I'm

471
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,178
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> working at smaller sized</font>

472
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,429
companies the jobs are no longer there

473
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:47,070
it used to be every small company had

474
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:48,990
two racks two routers to firewalls two

475
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,820
sets of switches that doesn't exist

476
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:54,330
anymore you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even get a / 24 for a</font>

477
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,279
small company anymore I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

478
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:58,110
point out that the the industry is<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

479
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,539
more consolidated its bigger companies

480
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,269
it's for me that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want</font>

481
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:05,940
to work at not to like ruin all my job

482
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,679
prospects for the future but I think

483
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,539
it's a strong consideration of what

484
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,749
types of opportunities are out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

485
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:17,220
how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be changing or can be more</font>

486
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:19,710
more targeted yep over all right Mike

487
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:23,730
Mike Thompson argonne national lab I

488
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:25,980
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a bias but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wonder what</font>

489
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">you all think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that I mean</font>

490
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:31,080
I think infrastructure and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

491
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:33,629
infrastructure especially is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

492
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:36,449
cool but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a handful of people</font>

493
00:20:33,629 --> 00:20:38,668
outside of this room and the people who

494
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,070
the people in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> room know who know</font>

495
00:20:38,669 --> 00:20:43,110
anything about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think part of</font>

496
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,220
that is a marketing problem with cloud

497
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,889
and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are happening</font>

498
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now where it's very attractive for</font>

499
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:50,610
cloud companies for their customers to

500
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:53,220
not know anything about their

501
00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:54,869
infrastructure but I think if especially

502
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:56,340
young people knew more about the

503
00:20:54,869 --> 00:20:59,279
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again this might be</font>

504
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,990
my bias they might be more hooked in and

505
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,029
think it was a lot cooler and want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

506
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,259
dive into it more and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious</font>

507
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:09,779
what people on the stages opinion is

508
00:21:06,259 --> 00:21:11,450
good if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanna fuzzy for my</font>

509
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:13,529
dissertation work I had to kind of

510
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,749
explore this community on my own and

511
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:18,139
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that was not an insignificant</font>

512
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:20,369
amount of travel and work to kind of

513
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:22,019
what social<font color="#E5E5E5"> scientists would call the</font>

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,799
stretches there he was one of the first

518
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,990
people that I met and was able to

519
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduce me to a lot of books Dave a</font>

520
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,320

many<font color="#E5E5E5"> other folks but that that took a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of time and it's and it's that's a</font>

523
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,379
heavy investment I had to like

524
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:41,850
continuously convince my committee that

525
00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:43,168
it was worth this there was this

526
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,959
knowledge base there that you could

527
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:48,299
garner but<font color="#CCCCCC"> um one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the benefits</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of NCI</font>

528
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,730

529
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,499
process and say here's here's your short

530
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,970
list of folks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in this domain</font>

531
00:21:52,499 --> 00:21:55,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that could that are really willing to</font>

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:57,690
help and

533
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,010
that's a that's something that's that's

534
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:00,630
that's right up it's right along line

535
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:05,370
along the lines of those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that comment</font>

536
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:08,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kevin what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do you think I think there's</font>

537
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:11,039
definitely a perception issue and I I

538
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:13,049
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the the makeup of the</font>

539
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,029
program right that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> teach at where we</font>

540
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:17,070
have very few domestic students because

541
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:19,649
they they just don't think this is

542
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,529
interesting and I I think part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

543
00:22:19,649 --> 00:22:25,320
is on us not on us but we could help

544
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:27,440
solve that problem with nanog to to show

545
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:31,019
that this is a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

546
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">segment bit of the industry to work in I</font>

547
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:38,789
think nanog on the road series is a

548
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:42,840
great possibility it has lots of a

549
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:44,970
shorter program more localized more more

550
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,678
cities hit that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of place</font>

551
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:48,899
where maybe we can attract folks to come

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:51,659
look and see see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're up to and</font>

553
00:22:48,899 --> 00:22:53,129
see that it is interesting and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

554
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's one thing that's certainly true</font>

555
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:58,380
is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a relatively small</font>

556
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,000
engineering discipline they're probably

557
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,470
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the people in</font>

558
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,210
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> room there's more right but there's</font>

559
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:06,510
probably fewer than ten thousand

560
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:08,429
engineers you know who fit in this

561
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:12,510
bucket and yes increasingly there are

562
00:23:08,429 --> 00:23:14,909
big companies a few big companies but if

563
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,500
you 10,000 sounds like a lot but if you

564
00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:17,909
compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to like the smallest of the</font>

565
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,639
traditional engineering disciplines like

566
00:23:17,909 --> 00:23:24,600
fire protection engineering 10,000 is

567
00:23:20,639 --> 00:23:26,219
really really small and so it's going to

568
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">be important for us to sort of hit above</font>

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,909
our weight in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the coming years to get</font>

570
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,220
the word out that we're actually a thing

571
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:33,690
because I'm not even sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know to</font>

572
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,820
some degree it's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to do that</font>

573
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,799
but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't agree it's also that's a</font>

574
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:40,620
thing like that's something people do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

575
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:42,000
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things we need</font>

00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,959
to do is be a little bit louder<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

577
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,059
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm over on the left there I</font>

578
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,250
Ryan rod and conversent again I was

579
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,600
curious if one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

580
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:53,159
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people learn the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most when they're</font>

581
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,289
coming out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of school and coming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into an</font>

582
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,260
infrastructure role in organization it

583
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:59,610
takes some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to develop the with my</font>

584
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,950
colleagues and I call the infrastructure

585
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,570
mindset you know the

586
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,730
the thoroughness the attention to detail

587
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,770
when making production changes or or

588
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,780
doing otherwise risky operations or

589
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,639
basic operations that can be risky in a

590
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,580
certain environment and I'm curious what

591
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,820
your thoughts are on giving students and

592
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:19,250
other entrance to the infrastructure

593
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,780
specialties exposure<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that or is it</font>

594
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:23,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">something inherently scary they need to</font>

595
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,580
learn you know trial by fire style I

596
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,110
mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two operators up here</font>

597
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,899
we can see into that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trial</font>

598
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:32,209
by fire is terrible I i think you know

599
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:34,090
you know 1998 called and they want their

600
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,680
network operations paradigm back right

601
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,810
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want they want to commit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> confirms</font>

602
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,690
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> they I was someone who learned sort</font>

603
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:45,050
of trial by<font color="#E5E5E5"> fire and boy I bought a lot</font>

604
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:47,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">of networks down I i think there's now a</font>

605
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:49,159
lot of reasonable evidence that if you

606
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,040
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who's a trained engineer</font>

607
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,500
computer scientist that with somewhere

00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">around two years of training in an</font>

609
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,850
organization that knows what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's doing</font>

610
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:02,210
you can impart that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of organization</font>

611
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:03,320
of operational discipline<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

612
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:05,930
think it's something that needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

613
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:08,510
nobody has that right nobody comes with

614
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:10,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the package you</font>

615

military they<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically have a lot of</font>

this this discipline in them already

618
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,100
although you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> network skills there</font>

619
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,390
are not as high as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to see</font>

620
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:22,520
but this is something with with just a

621
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple years you can instill or you can</font>

622
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,879
pretty easily till you'll never be able

623
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to instill it and have them go do</font>

624
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,530
something else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say the the</font>

625
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,730
one interesting kind of corollary to

626
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,649
that is we were just talking about

627
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,810
internships and co-ops that's why to

628
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,550
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent it's really a challenge to</font>

629
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:40,879
do either one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this industries you</font>

630
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:42,889
know it's easy to hire someone to write

631
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,780
some code and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw that code</font>

632
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:46,460
away or you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do whatever</font>

633
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,290
you want to do from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aspect or write</font>

634
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:50,150
an app or whatever that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be as a</font>

635
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:52,780
small little nugget of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> project but we</font>

636
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,100
start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a network IE a large</font>

637
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:57,889
interdependent system with a bunch of

638
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">different pieces inserting someone into</font>

639
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,580
that temporarily and then pulling them

640
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,830
out without them<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the full context</font>

641
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,159
of what they're working on is generally

642
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:09,220
not going to be hugely successful

643
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:12,640
so we this semester did a micro

644
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:14,650
segmentation not any new sexy stuff but

645
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,290
micro segmentation of a 500-person

646
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:19,150
network we just did hot cut over last

647
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:22,389
weekend<font color="#CCCCCC"> I involved my whole class in</font>

648
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:24,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">this we got we had every detail taken</font>

649
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:26,800
care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of we think we did and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually it</font>

650
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:29,290
did work out quite well but we believe

651
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:32,680
in being as immersive as possible I

652
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:34,540
spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> two three weeks talking about the</font>

653
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:37,900
needs assessment the architecture the

654
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:40,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan they knew it already and then they</font>

655
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:45,010
all helped in the cutover it was

656
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:46,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful awesome is something right</font>

657
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:47,740
frankly I just because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running out</font>

658
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:50,350
of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so could I just move on to the</font>

659
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,760
next question over there Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You</font>

662
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,470
a little bit on what jesse was saying

earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm a product of what's</font>

actually just be<font color="#E5E5E5"> upfront open about it</font>

and say it happens let's acknowledge it

good storytellers we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell about situations tell</font>

we're going to get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:54,850
something awesome<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could do third piece</font>

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,160
in terms of the immersion dive in

707
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:59,230
headfirst and learned trial by fire I

708
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,169
think things like the take-off effort

709
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,840
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just heard about are going to be</font>

00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:07,990
amazing at letting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new generation</font>

711
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,439
come in and feel better about jumping in

712
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:12,580
without a two-year<font color="#CCCCCC"> ramped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up cycle</font>

713
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,049
knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's some level of</font>

714
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:16,418
safety net that when we were starting

715
00:29:14,049 --> 00:29:18,100
off we didn't have that would try to

716
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:20,320
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that when they're learning</font>

717
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:23,559
they don't wipe out entire major

718
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,360
networks like thank you expect yeah

719
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:26,918
please one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so</font>

720
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,600
building off that comment and building

721
00:29:26,919 --> 00:29:30,250
off some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the breaking of eggs</font>

722
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,449
versus not like that's one of the things

723
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,250
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's a really fantastic</font>

724
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,990
balance that I heard over and over again

725
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,910
with interviews of network operators

726
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,520
that I did for my dissertation was we

727
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,770
got to a lament was we got to break eggs

728
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,330
and we got to learn by doing that but I

729
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:45,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">think one of the challenges that Matt</font>

730
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,770
just brought up as how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> create an</font>

731
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,840
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you can break some</font>

732
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,120
unimportant eggs and have that same

733
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,678
learning experience but without so so

734
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially it's asking how do you build</font>

735
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:01,450
a a lab that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually concomitant is</font>

736
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,250
consistent with reality or at least

737
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,570
approximate<font color="#CCCCCC"> too because when I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear I</font>

738
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:06,429
was hearing Dan talk a little bit

739
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:08,320
whenever I if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk into any any</font>

740
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:10,990
chemical engineering department of any

741
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,110
of any of any significant size one of

742
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:15,880
their floors is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dedicated plant like</font>

743
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:17,409
environment where they drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

744
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,179
students in for their practicum at the

745
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,190
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their coursework this is what a</font>

746
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,380
plant actually looks like that's one of

747
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:24,700
that's me the big challenge for the

748
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:27,550
College of<font color="#CCCCCC"> urgell program is how can you</font>

749
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,809
help education programs build the

750
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,590
equivalent of that equivalent of that

751
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:33,500
operations lab work

752
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:35,389
we can break eggs annex and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

753
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,130
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask us people ask the board</font>

754
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:38,570
quite frequently you know you had this

755
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:40,220
education series you were doing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

756
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:44,510
while why did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and it</font>

757
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">was because it was a very kind of anemic</font>

758
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,370
environment where people were doing

759
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,809
compte router bgp blah didn't simulate

760
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:52,340
anything in the real world and didn't

761
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:54,289
differentiate from anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

762
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,250
could get online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so to your point we</font>

763
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:57,080
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think more about that in the</font>

764
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:58,610
hackathon<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think was a great start we</font>

765
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,879
got it will take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question from</font>

766
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:03,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">the floor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then we're out of time hi</font>

767
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:06,409
I'm Steve Powell from level three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

768
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:08,419
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is this body of work that we</font>

769
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:10,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">described or are these disciplines that</font>

770
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:13,909
we describe it as network engineering is

771
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:16,039
this or just<font color="#CCCCCC"> com- mer ated on any of the</font>

772
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:19,610
public education<font color="#CCCCCC"> sites like for example</font>

773
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:21,620
account<font color="#CCCCCC"> Academy and if it is could we</font>

774
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,629
leverage that by just adding the

775
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,399
additional detail and maybe by just

776
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,500
putting it out there and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what</font>

777
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:30,379
you know sticks in terms of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

778
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:34,970
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> people interested in this field</font>

779
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:37,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole ICT field is so new and</font>

780
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:39,140
network engineering especially it's just

781
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:43,669
not understood by the masses how do we

782
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:47,299
market that that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good question any</font>

783
00:31:43,669 --> 00:31:49,760
closing<font color="#CCCCCC"> thoughts dancer that I think it</font>

784
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:51,500
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely an issue we've kind of</font>

785
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,419
covered this a few times in the sexiness

786
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,190
of it getting people to understand what

787
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is maybe we're all biased in the</font>

788
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,549
room I'm sure we all are everyone

789
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,230
everyone in here the first time you

790
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:02,418
walked<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a data center and you saw</font>

791
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,529
how cool it was like I'm sure there's

792
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:05,480
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who don't get that feeling</font>

793
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:07,490
and so we can't mistake the fact that

794
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,840
not everyone thinks that's sexy but

795
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:10,580
there's certainly people that we can

796
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,928
reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think we are</font>

797
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:20,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">today and on that note we're out of time</font>

798
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:22,700
we're super at a time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

799
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:25,279
for the education part of it so let's

800
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">say if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it a formal education</font>

801
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:29,480
part and we promote network engineering

802
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,010
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is the world is moving</font>

803
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,480
towards automation and the jobs are

804
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,520
reducing on the scale so how would you

805
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,020
fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem if you make it as a</font>

806
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:37,900
formal education and that would

807
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,290
definitely impact the

808
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:42,820
the students are guys who are doing it

809
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:45,670
yeah I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a great point</font>

810
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,310
you know we tried the formal education

811
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:50,320
thing it simply didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work as well in</font>

812
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,570
today we you know people voted with

813
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,490
their feet and we probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> had more</font>

814
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">people the hackathon yesterday then we</font>

815
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:59,860
add in the entire history<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

816
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,930
doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana educational series which</font>

817
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,879
i think is a pretty pretty effective

818
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:05,770
statement yeah it's a testament<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

819
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,410
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cut it off there I'm</font>

820
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,720
sorry we've got scheduled lunches and

821
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:13,570
things like that thank you so much my

822
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:20,880
panelists you guys were<font color="#E5E5E5"> awesome and I'll</font>

823
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:20,879
hand this off to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shawn all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>
