major router maintenance you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,359
finished all of the upgrades you've

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,180
needed you<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan this for months you've</font>

6
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,070
got everything just right and you jumped

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the plane and you flew to Hawaii or</font>

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,850
you're ready to relax everything is

<font color="#E5E5E5">great you just finished</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your massage and</font>

11
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:39,180
you walk back into your hotel room<font color="#CCCCCC"> relax</font>

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:44,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">as ever and then you hear that sound</font>

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,120
your phone buzzing and vibrating oh they

14
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,890
took out all the animations and just

15
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,040
then you look at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and you see</font>

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,350
this that string of text messages that

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:55,420
all of us dread hey Peter I'm getting

18
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">some weird alerts oh crap something's</font>

19
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,989
wrong I need you right now 48 missed

20
00:00:57,549 --> 00:01:00,610
calls answer your phone right now

21
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:02,890
everything is on fire the site is down

22
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,330
what did you do how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

23
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">been in that position before raise your</font>

24
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,929
hand if you've ever walked out gone home

25
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,060
from work and the router went down

26
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,620
afterwards for those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who've never</font>

27
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,720
had that problem please come talk to me

28
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,920
I would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you but I want</font>

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,030
well that is our motivation and the

31
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,979
impetus<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the tool that we wrote</font>

32
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:23,350
during the hackathon yesterday called

33
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,180
take off<font color="#CCCCCC"> its pre-fight validation and</font>

34
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,740
verification before bringing a router

35
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,560
back into service which chris will talk

36
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:34,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">about now hi I'm Chris so we all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">preflight checks we bring a new route</font>

38
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:39,009
into production generally if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

39
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,570
bring your new device you turn the

40
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:42,490
routing protocols or or cost them out

41
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,589
you do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure this thing</font>

42
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:49,479
is online but not taking production

43
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:51,520
traffic those pre checks is like those

44
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,100
pre flight tests most of them are

45
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,170
performed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> human beings you have a</font>

46
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,630
checklist you log into the router you

47
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:00,340
run commands you check the tables make

48
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,548
sure things look saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> interfaces up</font>

49
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:09,069
what have you why is this work being

50
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:12,280
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> by humans</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go so what</font>

51
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:13,869
lessons do we can we take from say

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,490
software development software

53
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,780
development has continuous integration

54
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:20,330
and unit testing you

55
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">to make them change to a code you run a</font>

56
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,200
standardized<font color="#CCCCCC"> test harness which runs</font>

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,260
through a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of standardized test</font>

58
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:32,269
modules and tells you if anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

59
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:37,130
amiss so take off is that idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied</font>

60
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:39,560
to operational state so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we built</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

61
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,390
harness a test harness framework now I

62
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,550
put the word unit testing in quotes here

63
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,899
because I'm not using any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

64
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:47,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">work we're developing in Python but</font>

65
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,280
we're not using any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standard test</font>

66
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,110
case modules I've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning</font>

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,910
that one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our team members is actually</font>

68
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on doing exactly that so</font>

69
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,620
hopefully next time represent this there

70
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:59,600
won't be any quotes there so we

71
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:02,450
developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard a standard class</font>

72
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,420
signature a superclass that a module

73
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you would write would inherit from</font>

74
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,649
you can so anyone can write through our

75
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:12,739
modules and add them to a test suite you

76
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:16,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">can run run the test stand alone or as</font>

77
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:17,630
part of a automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> device turn up so</font>

78
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,750
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a script</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that hits your</font>

79
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:23,359
device and removes is is overload you

80
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,980
can have it load<font color="#E5E5E5"> this module and execute</font>

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,519
the test runner immediately before that

82
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:29,869
and stop if anything comes back false

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,450
use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to augment your manual manual</font>

84
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,790
checks automate your final sanity checks

85
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,018
immediately before so if you tested it

86
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the morning and things look cool</font>

87
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:40,489
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> broke between that time in</font>

88
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,850
your test window hopefully this can help

89
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:46,250
you catch that so here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

90
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:49,358
what a sample test class looks like

91
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,489
there's a standard method signature

92
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,829
standard methods that get called based

93
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,260
on the success or failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

94
00:03:54,829 --> 00:03:59,030
you've written and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests can do</font>

95
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:00,440
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gets handed an ssh session</font>

96
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,530
to the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can execute</font>

97
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,459
commands on you can compare router state

98
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:09,739
to your offline source of truth run ping

99
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:15,350
tests whatever whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do</font>

100
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:18,140
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if one were to write a test you</font>

101
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,640
know develop your code here's a gamma

102
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:25,400
file to the test runner references to

103
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:28,400
use standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> python class class pat's</font>

104
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,049
classpath syntax here to point it to

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,310
your tests and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can write device</font>

106
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,000
specific tests or

107
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,070
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonspecific</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tests it'll run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,830
will run both the common and whatever

109
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:42,800
platform you give it there's a fake one

110
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:47,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there too just for testing get that</font>

111
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:51,110
in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then run your test you give it a</font>

112
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,880
platform name and a router name it it

113
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,820
runs through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tests reports reports</font>

114
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,700
wit past reports what failed get

115
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:08,360
additional debug info if you like so

116
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:10,400
take the code and let's go so obviously

117
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,230
Chris and I are<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer talking about this</font>

118
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,820
but this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the work of a team and the</font>

119
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,290
team was actually folks with varying

120
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">levels of programming experience from</font>

121
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,070
just beginning or just out of school too

122
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">many decades worth and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think one of</font>

123
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,250
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really learned about</font>

124
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,660
this is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in just seven short</font>

125
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,310
hours we could build something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

126
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,870
actually meaningful and can make our

127
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,510
lives better so if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done this</font>

128
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:30,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">before if you haven't programmed before</font>

129
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely join in and learn</font>

130
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,830
some ways you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can</font>

133
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,580
on facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> or you can download the code</font>

134
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,590
for this specific project on github it's

135
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,180
proof of concept now but we can keep

136
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,609
making this better with help from people

137
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,800
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe in the</font>
