bit of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is relevant to what was</font>

15
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:55,370
discussed and this is another talk about

16
00:00:53,269 --> 00:00:57,818
the cloud and look how white it is look

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,959
at fluffy it is isn't isn't it wonderful

20
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:07,220
this talk is effectively a short

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,720
checklist of things you can do to

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,500
prepare<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the day that the cloud</font>

decides to rain on top of you and it's

24
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,040
based on a few years<font color="#CCCCCC"> I spent working in</font>

product sick which is how I arrived in

26
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,620
how come I so first thing you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

27
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,630
plan you've got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be prepared now you</font>

28
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to know what you can do when day</font>

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,759
comes find out what your upstream is can

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,060
do for you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it nowhere</font>

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,700
to ask know how to trigger it you should

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,680
consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> your a UPS both yours that you</font>

streams because you may find that when

36
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,850
the day comes that you're at a look you

37
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,700
need to be nimble you need to be able to

38
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:53,770

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,370

00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,929
terms of where attack traffic may enter

45
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,889

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,420

or what a range of ips is attracting

65
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:53,610

perfectly good reason for seeing half

pretty safely filter everything else

00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:09,269
it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good DNS</font>

carefully and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> used very tactically</font>

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,480
it can be very very effective and I've

the ability to offload and some of the

burden upstream they can be useful they

132

can defer and think they can handle a

certain number of your attacks depending

need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bigger bulk because you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

gigs capacity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the M plus 1 egg is a</font>

148
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:14,460
killer so you can pass that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

149
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,530
somebody else use somebody else's<font color="#E5E5E5"> built</font>

150
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,450
and you'll find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your op streams</font>

151
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,489
will have capabilities they can offer

00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:24,330
you possibly as part of your standard

service possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> as an added extra or</font>

154
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,200
you can use third-party alternatives

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,800
like CD ends or details protection

156
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:36,060
services and CDN basically is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font>

over a very

161
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:43,990
wide footprint and basically just

162
00:06:41,169 --> 00:06:46,870
ignoring it and but they don't suit all

163
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,620
types of legitimate traffic you have

164
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:52,059
DDoS protection services which are

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:54,729
effectively dedicated capacity sitting

00:06:52,059 --> 00:06:57,669
there to be used to soak up and scrub

167
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:59,620
DDoS attacks and they will pass the

cleaner post mitigation traffic back to

can handle and have some options

obviously for for stuff that you can't

184
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,069
so there's no questions if anybody has

any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions by all means come up</font>

191
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,780
I just want to put out a quick

somewhat interesting and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing else</font>

200
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:38,430
it'll be something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you won't be</font>

201
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:40,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">able to unsee going forward hopefully so</font>

202
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:44,069
with that being said here in Illinois

203
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,870
and in Chicago largely think you could

204
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,270
make a strong case to have the official

205
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,390
state flower replaced with the

its prevalence in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the springtime how far</font>

208
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,140
and wide it reaches it's hard to go a

209
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,660
couple of city blocks in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> city here</font>

210
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:02,850
without coming across some of the

211
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,140
strange hieroglyphic looking markings

212
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,730
that you might find<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the streets and</font>

214
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,070
acts of street art these are actually

215
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,319
utility markings that identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

what lies beneath they can be a couple

<font color="#E5E5E5">of different pieces of data including</font>

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:28,260
what the utility is that's that's very

221
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:32,220
there how large it is what sort of

222
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:34,740
direction and heads and so on and the

223
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason why you're encouraged to call</font>

to 72 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead of time is because</font>

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,270
need some time to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> some research and</font>

229
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,890
then come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mark up the street</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to the sidewalk or the backyard if there</font>

231
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:54,600
might see flags instead of spray paints

232
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:57,390
to sort of identify what this is and

233
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:01,950
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this obviously helps us from having</font>

234
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:03,600
some unfortunate events occur so there's

235
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,760
sort of a method<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these markings</font>

236
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,100
there's some color and some shorthand

237
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,270
codes that you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find with it but the</font>

238
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,440
the other thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of is</font>

239
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,880
important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind about these</font>

240
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,260
types of markings is that it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

241
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,720
what they say on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the street themselves</font>

242
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,769
it's also what they imply so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

243
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,470
in our business

244
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:21,360
this you know may imply sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

coming so this is a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took right</font>

252
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:38,369
fact cutting up the street and doing

253
00:10:35,489 --> 00:10:40,589
some excavating you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> our friend</font>

00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:44,480
in simultaneous nemesis the backhoe

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:48,119
there in the back left hand corner there

256
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,619
so the codes themselves the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that</font>

257
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:50,879
they work is there's the there's a

258
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:52,799
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different dimensions to them one</font>

259
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,389
is color so the markings on the street

260
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,980
the actual color that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to paint</font>

261
00:10:54,389 --> 00:10:58,410
the streets will indicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font>

262
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,759
utility that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> below so for example if</font>

263
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see red markings as typically</font>

264
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,379
indicative of electrical<font color="#E5E5E5"> buried conduits</font>

265
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,868
if you see blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's potable water</font>

266
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:09,179
yellow is typically natural gas or some

267
00:11:06,869 --> 00:11:10,889
other type of petroleum product and some

<font color="#E5E5E5">cases steam if your city has steam</font>

tunnels we're seeing steam conduits

270
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,110
green perhaps appropriately as sewer so

271
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,189
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> something want to avoid and the</font>

272
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,449
stuff that you'll probably pay most

00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:23,868
attention to or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the orange</font>

274

communication so buried fiber optics or

275
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:29,339
CATV type stuff and then white markings

276
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:33,240
which indicate potential routes of cuts

277
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:35,670
or of exclamation or excavation work

278
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,240
that's to be done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get to why</font>

279
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,679
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> also important than that so in</font>

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition to the colors there's also some</font>

281
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,249
symbols that you'll see and I realize

282
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:45,569
now that the font that I use them the

283
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,519
the symbol themselves was probably too

284
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:49,469
which is too small to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see so I'll walk</font>

285
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,209
you through real quick in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> upper left</font>

286
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,220

287
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:54,660
symbols there you see a diamond shape

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,329
and that's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of indicative of a</font>

00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:58,769
single conduit this is typically

290
00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:00,449
centered over where the conduit is

291
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:02,639
buried in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground and it runs along</font>

292
00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:04,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">the conduit length below that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

293
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,689
corridor or sort of maybe a grouping

294
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:07,859
either a large duct or a grouping of

295
00:12:06,689 --> 00:12:09,899
different kind of its that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are laid next</font>

296
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,519
to each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and again those sort of</font>

297
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,929
outline centered around where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the center</font>

298
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those are and outlines the sort of</font>

299
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:18,419
areas where where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the marker believes</font>

300
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,189
that the conduit ends next set is

301
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:22,019
oversized<font color="#E5E5E5"> utility so things like large</font>

302
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:24,689
water mains or sewer pipes those will

303
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:25,799
have that sort of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sideways each</font>

304
00:12:24,689 --> 00:12:27,929
pattern with the line through it and

305
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,639
above that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a sort of directional</font>

306
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:31,150
indicator that that points to something

307
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:33,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> may not be right here in the store</font>

308
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:36,069
but it may be several feet off to the

309
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,290
side and it'll be indicated by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the by</font>

310
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distance to that particular utility</font>

311
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,920
whatever it is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times to see</font>

312
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:44,920
individual conduits that are labeled

313
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,780
like the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the far right which in</font>

314
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,990
this case is you know an<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight-inch low</font>

315
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:52,120
pressure gas marking and it basically

316
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,710
shows you as a single conduit heads in a

317
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,690
pickle direction and some information

318
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:57,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it now on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side here</font>

319
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,290
you can see there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some codes single</font>

320
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,450
letter multi letter codes that sort of

321
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">give some additional hints as to what's</font>

322
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,250
in it so low pressure high pressure

323
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes it mentions what the kind of</font>

324
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's made out of if it's encased in</font>

325
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,680
concrete or if it's plastic or steel and

326
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:14,110
it's just to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> some more information</font>

327
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">about what's there and how to handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

328
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,120
how to approach it from the the diggers

329
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,230
perspective so here's an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

330
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,170
actual marking that's right down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">street if you can kind of tell from the</font>

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,479
the handwriting here of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

333
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:31,110
marker this is an eighteen t fiber optic

334
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,760
cable it's noted by the upper<font color="#CCCCCC"> right hand</font>

335
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,530
sort of labeling there it's inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

336
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,330
micro duct or very very small duct and

337
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,860
it runs<font color="#E5E5E5"> along the path is indicated by</font>

338
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:41,620
the marking this is extra across a

339
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,570
sidewalk and on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

340
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,130
hand gig notation sort of indicating

341
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,350
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably shallow very</font>

342
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:49,810
shallow and otherwise you don't want to

343
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:53,530
be using sort of mechanized tools to get

344
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:55,900
it out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there or to dig around it so</font>

345
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:57,730
why is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this important well for one thing</font>

346
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,959
if nothing else is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> nifty to be</font>

347
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:00,610
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of look at the street and</font>

348
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:03,010
see what's underneath it like you have

349
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,450
x-ray vision or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:07,060
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other things it seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

351
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,920
business probably ninety nine percent of

the population have no idea that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

stuff is even there or what it's used

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:14,739
for anything like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that order so it's</font>

355
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,390
kind of neat to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that it may help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

the street or sidewalk or or other

places it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also sort of show you what</font>

361
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:28,780
other stuff is around you so it maybe

362
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,069
give you some<font color="#E5E5E5"> hints as to like what kind</font>

of trouble you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect if there's a</font>

lot of stuff around you you may have a

lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> street work happening or it may</font>

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">even show you like sort of what carriers</font>

367
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,870
are nearby so one of the major<font color="#E5E5E5"> carriers</font>

368
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,680
will have stuff in the ground and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

369
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,660
can see this is a long their pathway of

370
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,529
course the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best thing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

371
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,509
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in</font>

372
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:49,389
tended to avoid what i refer to as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

373
00:14:46,509 --> 00:14:52,149
you bees which are unanticipated and

00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:54,129
unwanted backhoe events<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the ones</font>

375
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:55,509
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see picture below i don't know</font>

376
00:14:54,129 --> 00:14:57,730
if this sent a shudder through anybody

377
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:59,560
in the room this is a breach that

378
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,680
occurred on our one of our campuses back

379
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,638
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> december so fun time of year to have</font>

380
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:08,920
to do some groundwork for sure and so in

381
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,329
conclusion when you cease markings you

382
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,699
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of be sure that somebody is</font>

383
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:14,469
performing the dark art of conjuring

384
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:16,870
some digging utilities or some digging

385
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,209
equipment on site nearby sometime the

386
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,589
near future of course sort of point

387
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,359
through the markings all have different

388
00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:24,550
meetings and although the standard was

389
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,230
sort of proposed by the American Public

390
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:28,359
Works Association it doesn't necessarily

391
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:30,970
ply to all municipalities there are some

392
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,319
that have some overruling sort of color

393
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,329
codes that they use to might indicate

394
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:38,050
team won her team to those types of

395
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:40,149
things also I had a hard time finding

396
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,349
information about Canada or Mexico it

397
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:44,199
seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> the candidate doesn't have a</font>

398
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:45,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific standard but my cousin who's a</font>

399
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:48,099
civil engineer tells me that they

400
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,019
loosely follow a similar code so he

401
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,769
speaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Canada story checks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

402
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,970
sounds good so take note of the markings

403
00:15:53,769 --> 00:15:57,490
that you may find near any of your

404
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,629
facilities or any of your buildings you

405
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,910
know number one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course this means</font>

406
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:03,279
there's work coming but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also want to</font>

407
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,290
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of note if your stuff prepped more</font>

408
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:07,240
importantly isn't marked and everything

409
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,189
else is that's something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get</font>

410
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,889
rectified probably sooner rather than

411
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:13,599
later and then last if your contractor

412
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:16,209
who's going to be doing some work<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">you isn't already they probably are but</font>

414
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:19,119
if they aren't already they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

415
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:20,559
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put white markings on the street</font>

416
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,819
where they intend to cut because that's

417
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to help those utility companies</font>

00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:24,910
when they come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mark the streets</font>

419
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:27,309
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help them to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of focus</font>

420
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:28,389
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area to ensure that they're there</font>

421
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:32,469
they're absolutely sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's nothing</font>

00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:34,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">underneath there so that's really it I</font>

423
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:37,170
think those that's my talking so thank

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>
