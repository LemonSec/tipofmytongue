1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,750
so this is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the presentation</font>

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,280
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> give to the five people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who</font>

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:13,250
come back to lunch on time it's I'm

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,770
click it's waiting there you go ah

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:18,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">PowerPoint um you cannot imagine a more</font>

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,150
boring talk title than this but I

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,300
promise it won't be excruciating<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee</font>

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:30,119
dull it'll maybe be like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sharp</font>

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,759
stick not a dull stick in your eye so so

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,980
so therefore of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start off with</font>

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">why care about metrics this is this is</font>

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a pretty important topic and</font>

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,059
yet it feels so naturally dull to all of

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:43,559
us so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try to spend just a</font>

15
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,500
couple minutes convincing you that this

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,870
actually matters if at that point I fail

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:52,050
and there's coffee outside you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

18
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,140
some and come back and try again so the

19
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing we care about is that</font>

20
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,840
transient withdrawals and flapping of

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,149
routes which is what we're going to talk

22
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,920
about metrics for actually matter to

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:03,390
your networks regardless of whether you

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">cause</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them or not so we're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,500
metrics for routing instabilities and

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,110
transient unreachable networks in the

27
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,580
interdomain space but they affect your

28
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,200
routing tables they affect the reach

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,750
ability of those routes from your

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,670
networks they affect your users so they

31
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,140
matter regardless of whether you<font color="#CCCCCC"> caused</font>

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,430
them or not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the first thing I</font>

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">want you to believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know whether</font>

34
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,580
you believe it yet but I want you to

35
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:26,040
believe it and the second thing I want

36
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to believe is that we need a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,329
quantifying the scope and magnitude of

38
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,798
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems and frankly what I mean</font>

39
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,559
by that is we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of quantifying</font>

40
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:37,259
and qualifying suckitude right now we

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,140
all say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh such-and-such sucks or</font>

42
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,380
yesterday so-and-so socked or that other

43
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,950
thing it really sucked a lot um yeah we

44
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,600
suck less than those guys suck so what

45
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,460
we're here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you is actually we</font>

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,320
can give some numbers to the and some

47
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,419
characteristics of the ways in which

48
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,479
different kinds of things suck and we

49
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,610
can we can use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to compare various</font>

50
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,110
kinds of suckitude and so you can say

51
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like although it got a whole lot</font>

52
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">of press the boss against go in fact</font>

53
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,310
didn't suck at all it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just didn't matter</font>

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,739
it didn't score on the suck meter of any

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,190
sort whereas other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that</font>

56
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:14,290
got much less press and

57
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,359
sucked a lot and will<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you the ways</font>

58
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,459
in which they saw so that's think of

59
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,440
point number two as quantifying and

60
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,090
qualifying suckitude I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

61
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,030
would get through on the slide so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

62
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,380
sounds more formal here do you like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

63
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,750
the third one I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is a</font>

64
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,220
common language right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and this is</font>

65
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,450
really essentially the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

66
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,600
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a way of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exchanging</font>

67
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:36,880
information about how bad things are in

68
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,710
the way in which<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're bad and then</font>

69
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,299
the fourth is just the standard sort of

70
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,190
MBA mantra that turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

71
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,690
annoyingly true even though the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MBA is</font>

72
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,310
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time which is you</font>

73
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">really actually can't improve stuff you</font>

74
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:48,670
don't measure because it turns out you

75
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:50,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">just do random stuff and sometimes it's</font>

76
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:52,570
better and sometimes it's worse and it

77
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,950
doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what</font>

78
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:54,970
I'm going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is and I'm going to go</font>

79
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:56,920
pretty fast because there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

80
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,960
content we're going to introduce some

81
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,420
fast changing routing metrics for

82
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,340
misbehaving prefixes we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

83
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,049
about two concrete metrics one of them

84
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,030
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nets out and one of them is penalty</font>

85
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,740
boxes I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to calculate</font>

86
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,630
those metrics how you can calculate

87
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,370
those net metrics and show just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

88
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:15,280
examples of the different kinds of

89
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,959
things those metrics catch and the word

90
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,580
and we'll show how to compute them on

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,680
data that you may already have or how to

92
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:23,800
compute them on a ripe data or route

93
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,170
views data that's available<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

94
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,970
there's basically two kinds of routing

95
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,920
metrics one of them there<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been a</font>

96
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,690
lot of talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that nanog about a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

97
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,208
you are well<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of the work on which</font>

98
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,890
is structural metrics metrics about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

99
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:38,230
many a esas they are and how those a

100
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,238
esas relate to each other and how many

101
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,310
pairwise relationships there are in the

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,959
degree of random asses and those are

103
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,760
structural metrics they're very

104
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,650
slow-moving so they have to do with the

105
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,450
structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way metrics work that's</font>

106
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,160
not what we're talking about those are

107
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">good metrics a lot of smart people have</font>

108
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">done a lot of excellent work on that and</font>

109
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should refer to that work we're</font>

110
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,050
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about fast metrics so metrics</font>

111
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:01,060
that happen on the order of seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

112
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,910
minutes to hours that things change very

113
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:07,300
dynamically very quickly and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

114
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:08,739
the this you cannot do from very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

115
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,230
things like just looking at the rate of

116
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:13,000
updates or looking at ASI Jason sees you

117
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,410
have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at individual routing</font>

118
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,970
updates you have to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at every</font>

119
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,010
announcement and every withdrawal in

120
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:19,899
order to be able to see these so simple

121
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,029
routing table metrics like dumping a

122
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,960
table every 30 seconds you miss it it

123
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:27,909
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> count you have</font>

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,620
to look at every update<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so an ideal</font>

125
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,389
inst of it if we were to say here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

126
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,710
say an ideal instability metric wouldn't

127
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:34,479
exist because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of boring for</font>

128
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,219
you guys but<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ideal interesting</font>

129
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,349
instability metric would be something

130
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:40,419
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was as applicable to the whole</font>

131
00:04:38,349 --> 00:04:42,610
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it was to a single prefix or</font>

132
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:44,530
the whole collection of prefixes in an

133
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,509
AS it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> meaningful across</font>

134
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,400
multiple time scales we should be able

135
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:49,810
to tune it so that it's sensitive to the

136
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,818
kinds of things we want and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show</font>

137
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,530
you some basic tunings for this and it

138
00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,240
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be easy to understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and compute</font>

139
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,070
my claim is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done that you can</font>

140
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,860
throw the fruit later if that turns out

141
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:01,990
to not be true<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nets out to</font>

142
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,150
instability metrics we're proposing nets

143
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,759
out counts the subpopulation of

144
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:09,219
transiently withdrawn<font color="#CCCCCC"> network prefixes</font>

145
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,440
at any given time transiently withdrawn

146
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,020
means they didn't go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> for forever</font>

147
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,759
they did used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exist they don't exist</font>

148
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,580
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there is no route for these</font>

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,500
prefixes right now so when a big US

150
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,258
government asre engineers their networks

151
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:26,889
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourteen hundred and fifty prefixes</font>

152
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,630
243 prefixes and the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1400 and</font>

153
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:29,979
change never come back that's not

154
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,690
transiently withdrawn they were

155
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,940
engineered out<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're never coming back</font>

156
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,500
they don't count but if something<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes</font>

157
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,360
away like let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a big power</font>

158
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,889
outage in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the northeast of the US it</font>

159
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,740
wouldn't happen but if it did happen

160
00:05:38,889 --> 00:05:44,530
there might be foreign changed thousand

161
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,180
prefixes that go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away for up to four or</font>

162
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,400
five days<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then they all come back</font>

163
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:50,110
that's transiently withdrawn the other

164
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,359
one we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is penalty boxes</font>

165
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:53,590
so we're going to count the

166
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,190
subpopulation of network prefixes that

167
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:58,929
are in various<font color="#E5E5E5"> flat penalty states</font>

168
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,789
instantaneously<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now just to clarify</font>

169
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,759
for those of you who are geeks about

170
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:05,349
this ie most of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> um this doesn't mean</font>

171
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the networks that we're measuring</font>

172
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,509
actually turn on flat flat penalties

173
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what this means is that we're</font>

174
00:06:10,509 --> 00:06:15,430
using that as a metric of understanding

175
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,949
how bad of scoring the stability of

176
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,930
routes so I understand most networks

177
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,419
many networks don't turn on flap

178
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:24,099
dampening butt-flap using the flat

179
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:26,560
dampening algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still a very</font>

180
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:31,089
useful way of understanding how stable a

181
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,949
route is so guidelines you need to stink

182
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,349
here's if you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this for</font>

183
00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself here's what you should do you</font>

184
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:37,990
got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of peers</font>

185
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,130
and they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to be distinct they've</font>

186
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,020
got to have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of</font>

187
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,610
connectivity they probably should be

188
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,960
geographically dispersed so you want

189
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,960
them on most continents or all

190
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,330
continents as we do when you're trying

191
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to correlate announcements across peers</font>

192
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,349
it doesn't we all know I mean none of us

193
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,210
would do this but there are goofy people

194
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,760
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they do silly things and</font>

195
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:59,530
when they do when one is out there says

196
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're prefix isn't reachable it</font>

197
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:03,489
doesn't matter I mean it mattered maybe

198
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,020
if it's AOL it matters<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe if it's</font>

199
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,030
someone that you care about a lot some

200
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,890
trading partner someone you have VPNs

201
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:11,979
with four important customers it matters

202
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:14,440
but on the whole what any individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/s</font>

203
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:16,150
or any individual Pierre says probably

204
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't matter that much on the other</font>

205
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,859
hand if seven geographically dispersed

206
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,770
peers all agree that a particular prefix

207
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,420
is not reachable that's significant if

208
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,340
they all have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different up streams and</font>

209
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,140
they all agree that's very significant

210
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,880
okay so you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correlate pure</font>

211
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:33,099
consensus and you have to do temporal

212
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,440
correlations so as announcements cascade

213
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,720
you have to be able to say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

214
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,340
withdrawal and if two and a half minutes

215
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,250
later a different pure withdraws the

216
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,169
same prefix it's part of the same

217
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,640
withdrawal it's part of the same prefix

218
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,890
becoming unreachable so you need a

219
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:49,840
window<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time in which you allow these</font>

220
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:52,719
things to stretch and you have to factor

221
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">out this temporal jitter different peers</font>

222
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,110
are going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same announcement</font>

223
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,880
at slightly different times related to

224
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,620
the update clocks related to where they

225
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,740
hear it from you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> factor that out</font>

226
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,290
so here's a good example of this okay in

227
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,360
this in this chart each one of these is

228
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">a peer of ours we've got peers on every</font>

229
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,600
continent except for Antarctica and I'll

230
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:12,250
pay someone money to give me a full

231
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,290
table<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Amanda</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Antarctica I'm just</font>

232
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:17,380
announcing that right now anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

233
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:20,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 bucks you got a full</font>

234
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,900
table from Antarctica okay all right all

235
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">right he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said 100 bucks I know you</font>

236
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:27,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">got a full table from Antarctica we'll</font>

237
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,680
talk later each one of these disappear

238
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,349
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> green our announcements read or</font>

239
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,330
withdrawals and here you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole</font>

240
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,940
block in the middle these<font color="#CCCCCC"> piers are</font>

241
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:40,990
flapping something fierce okay this is a

242
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:42,520
single / 24 / 12 hours and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

243
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:44,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> peers behaving in this</font>

244
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,279
particular way and these two right here

245
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,220
are behaving in the same way

246
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,870
all right up here but then now you've

247
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,550
got all these other peers at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top and</font>

248
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,259
at the bottom then in fact don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

249
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,758
that rate of announcements<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you</font>

250
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:58,850
have other peers right there that are

251
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,519
flap dampening<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what this tells</font>

252
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,069
you is having<font color="#E5E5E5"> two peers having five</font>

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,389
peers probably isn't enough you really

254
00:09:04,069 --> 00:09:09,860
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correlate these kinds of things</font>

255
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:12,230
across a number of peers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um the</font>

256
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,059
there are reasons for that the the one

257
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,829
that we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just looking at is this /</font>

258
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:18,350
24 and you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the slides</font>

259
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:20,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">that comes from not to pick on them but</font>

260
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:24,019
well it's there / 2401 communications

261
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:26,779
there's a number of their up streams are

262
00:09:24,019 --> 00:09:28,879
only seeing the / 17 so those people

263
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:30,889
think that this is a very stable route

264
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,360
this is very reachable there's a whole

265
00:09:30,889 --> 00:09:35,180
collection of other people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who get the</font>

266
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,259
route via<font color="#CCCCCC"> cochin that in fact are seeing</font>

267
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:42,589
all kinds of instability<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the / 24</font>

268
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:44,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay again looking at the way various</font>

269
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:46,399
peers see this stuff you see a bunch of

270
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,220
instability there on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left hand side</font>

271
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,379
a rapid succession of announcements

272
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,600
withdrawals announcements okay so

273
00:09:51,379 --> 00:09:55,910
something happen then you see the silent

274
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,559
period so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people decided this</font>

275
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a waste of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not listening you</font>

276
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,459
this I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dampen this eventually</font>

277
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:02,689
the announcements come back so there's a

278
00:10:01,459 --> 00:10:04,729
collection of peers who see the

279
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:06,319
announcements earlier then pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

280
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,329
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> says okay I see these</font>

281
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,910
announcements later there's a number of

282
00:10:08,329 --> 00:10:13,160
outliers here there's two peers who see

283
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,959
it much much later and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one pair</font>

284
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,879
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours who never renounce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a--'s that</font>

285
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,268
route in the 30-day time window that we

286
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,220
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again the point here is this</font>

287
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:24,199
stuff looks pretty easy if you look at

288
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">the route dynamics from a single peer or</font>

you look at subpopulations these are

meaning outside of the full internet

324
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:40,878
because the full internet roughly has

the stability as and the prefixes have

326

the stability they have and it probably

327
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:45,439
doesn't change that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> over time all</font>

separated by no more than some number of

withdrawals and then 20 minutes later I

see two other withdrawals that's not

the maximum again minimum and maximum we

355
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,860
this is to calculate some prefixes never

<font color="#E5E5E5">it never comes back you just need to not</font>

360
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,790
count that as an outage okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show</font>

361

some examples of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks like</font>

362
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:09,349
and and the sensitivity of the knobs to

various kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of adjustments pure</font>

364
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,000
withdrawal jitter so the pier withdrawal

365
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,920
jitter it's

366
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,680
not very sensitive basically you see the

367
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,860
same shape on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top whether you set it</font>

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,410
of time you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to wait 10</font>

minutes for a withdrawal from<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of</font>

your peers to show up so that's good

374
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,820
because waiting around for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

375
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:36,930
is computationally expensive you have to

376
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,100
store a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> state to do that</font>

00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,469
correlating<font color="#E5E5E5"> it by number of peers is</font>

378
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,810
somewhat sensitive it turns out with

379
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,950
three piers and this is good news<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

and there's some good research to be

431
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,750
done in which one is correct so

432
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,730
basically you put a you put a prefix in

433
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:45,770
a penalty<font color="#E5E5E5"> state when either a withdrawal</font>

434
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,930
or announcement is reached you decay

435
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:49,040
that exponentially if it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

436
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:51,859
know and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you count</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of</font>

437
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,260
prefixes that are in various boxes very

438
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,390
simple you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see here that some of the</font>

439
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,610
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can adjust with that if</font>

440
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,860
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of prefixes in</font>

441
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:04,520
penalty for six and eight here you'll

442
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,550
see that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> august fourteenth blackout</font>

443
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:09,590
in the US and<font color="#CCCCCC"> canada does not show up on</font>

444
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,209
this metric which is cool that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means</font>

445
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:13,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this metric captures something</font>

446
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:16,220
different from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nets out metric this</font>

447
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,720
captures routing that is for prefixes

448
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:19,880
that changes rapidly and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a</font>

449
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,190
big change<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand odd prefixes</font>

450
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,540
went away many many hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> later some of</font>

451
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,340
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to come back after that</font>

452
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,620
they were all back that's not big

453
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:30,290
changes on the other hand the so big

454
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,870
worm is a big spike here that means that

455
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the so big worm caused a lot of routing</font>

456
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,080
changes on a lot of people's networks

457
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:39,020
over a relatively short period<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time</font>

458
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,120
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the point the take home message</font>

459
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,800
here is you can make pretty pictures to

460
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,070
show that this captures something

461
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,430
different than the other one all right

462
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:52,730
an interesting 3d view on penalty boxes

463
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:56,540
there is a one long flapping autonomous

464
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,700
system had about 40 odd prefixes in and

465
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,740
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the blue and basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

466
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,840
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its prefixes were in zero penalty</font>

467
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,270
state all of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sudden roughly on sep</font>

468
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:08,210
tember 20th a bunch of prefixes started

469
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,280
flapping really really heavily all the

470
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:11,750
way up into 15 penalty which means that

471
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">you we add there saw an announcement or</font>

472
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:18,079
a withdrawal up to 15 times every<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

473
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,300
minutes for those prefixes so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

474
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,949
lot of routing activity over a large

475
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,690
number of days so this wasn't a few

476
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours this wasn't a weekend this wasn't</font>

477
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:29,300
a week this is a few weeks and then they

478
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:33,530
all got better all of a sudden and you

479
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,980
can think what you will about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so</font>

480
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:39,210
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me wrap up why bother with this</font>

481
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:43,809
I try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a compelling case but</font>

482
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:46,030
there are long-term problems with the

483
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:47,770
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of situations that these metrics</font>

measure that people in this community

485
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,389
don't spend a lot of time talking or

487
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,400
will flap significant numbers of routes

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,530
for relatively long periods of time

489
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,940
undetected and nobody cares about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or</font>

490
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,230
maybe once they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it they care</font>

491
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,460
about it but we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure these</font>

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we don't talk about their</font>

500
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:23,020
that much<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to know how far these</font>

501
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:27,010
excursions from the norm go and how long

<font color="#CCCCCC">they go on for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we've presented some</font>

simple intuitive metrics here they work

504
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:34,000
over short and long periods of time they

505
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,980
work across the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole internet or just</font>

your prefixes or just a set of prefixes

507
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:39,940
that you care about they're sensitive to

various kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tuning so you can tune</font>

help us automatically distinguish

between bad stuff and good stuff and

these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that you can compute by</font>

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,770
data you can get route views data and

516
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:58,780
we'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to accept your BGP feeds</font>

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:01,799
and help compute these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you so</font>

518
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,799
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:18,919
while he comes up to get himself ready

521
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">avi you've got three seconds</font>

522
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:36,910
in an operational sense have to quantify

523
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,909
the impact of the turn I think instead

524
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay a lot of us get the sense that</font>

525
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:48,590
there is impact performance impact two

526
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,210
sequences of I turn but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

527
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:52,250
hasn't that isn't really accepted

528
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:54,980
something people could point to second

529
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,200
thing is it would be interesting to look

530
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:59,060
at the tech sauna me of updates some

531
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,890
updates change paths some don't

532
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,889
withdrawals versus updates and head

533
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,040
coupe

534
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,409
wait kidnapped I'm coming on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this yeah</font>

535
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:23,140
okay we're have a small technical

536
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:25,360
problems okay um the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first point</font>

537
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,670
yeah I I don't know how to quantify the

538
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,939
operational impact of these late just

539
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:33,340
some raw numbers on the a s that we that

540
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,800
we pointed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in that graph over about</font>

541
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:41,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">30 odd peers which is what we measured</font>

542
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:44,500
it on we had we had about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400,000</font>

543
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:49,000
announcements or withdrawals in 24 hours

544
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:50,770
for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 prefixes so it's not a tiny</font>

545
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,690
amount of stuff it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of stuff I</font>

546
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:54,010
don't know how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> that matters it's</font>

547
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of a loaded question the wrong</font>

548
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,150
project people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have done some studies</font>

549
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,200
we've done some studies that show

550
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:01,990
correlation between actual user

551
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,820
performance in churn but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

552
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,040
lot of people don't don't realize that

553
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's sort of proof of that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it be</font>

554
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,090
in fact not much research has been done

555
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,190
on that but to get the boss to realize

556
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it is or isn't a problem he doesn't</font>

557
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,790
he's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to know from you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hi</font>

558
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:23,770
bgp churn he's gonna want to know what

559
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:25,950
does that mean you know impact thank you

560
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,950
owe me
