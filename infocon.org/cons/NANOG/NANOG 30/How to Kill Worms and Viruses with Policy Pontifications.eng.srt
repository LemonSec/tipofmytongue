00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,910
there's an emergency back at Harvard

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,680
I've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go back today for which</font>

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,910
unfortunately and I don't particularly

want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's the way it goes</font>

10
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:33,600
sometimes I just got this new title at

Harvard that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the university technology</font>

me they're certainly not a it's not a

previously unknown title it's sort of

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,270
some of the stuff I've been doing but

18
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,190
it's it's actually formalized it took a

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,730
long time to get formalized it took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

39
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,399
these are these are bullets out of my

here I advise the CIO I facilitate this

and I monitor that but there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

nothing there there these are all very

fuzzy things

47
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:16,690
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a byproduct of the</font>

you've been around as long as Harvard

52
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:30,160
and that's the way you do things so from

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,220
the outside Harvard sort of looks like

54
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">this it sort of looks like a thing but</font>

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:40,180
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harvard is not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing Harvard</font>

and other thing which faculty of arts

and science is about sixty percent of

is certainly this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a university which</font>

whether it's a sum or not we'll have to

the university but actually the picture

91
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,950
of Harvard this isn't the full picture

92
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:05,440
of Harvard this is the politically

93
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:08,940
correct picture of Harvard the more real

94
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,859
picture of Harvard is this we have

95
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,359
researchers with even more ego than the

96
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,700
Faculty of Arts and Sciences if that can

97
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,079
be passively<font color="#E5E5E5"> imagined and we have lots</font>

them so the university is not a

Economics Department when he was when

127
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,260
when he was at Harvard previously he's

decided that this fractious thing that

went under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guise of Harvard should</font>

132
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,970
actually become a thing rather than a

the senior staff thing last year where

136
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,059
he said every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in its own bottom</font>

137
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,370
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an old Harvard slogan simply</font>

138
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,780
won't cut it anymore you just can't use

saying well that's stupid we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

them risk management not audit services

174
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:26,030
and the Office of General Counsel which

175
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:29,469
is Harvard's risk-averse avoid so I came

176
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:32,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with its set of best practices for</font>

it through the you tag and I sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general counsel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they sent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a note saying you can't call it</font>

182
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:45,440
best practices they can't be the best

183
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,880
practices they may be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

184
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,590
practices but they can't be the best

185
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:52,669
practices that's lawyers we pay them a

186
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,150
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money to to be that</font>

187
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:58,639
obstructionist but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they</font>

188
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,380
that's their their role in life is to be

189
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,030
obstructionist and to be risk aversive

190
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,030
and they've actually done pretty good a

191
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,010
job at that the other thing I do is I go

192
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:08,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">around wander around to various schools</font>

193
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,669
and find out what they're doing and so

194
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,500
far it's actually not too<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad other than</font>

195
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:14,479
they say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any idea what the</font>

196
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,820
research groups doing we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

197
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:18,740
control over them but we do foot pretty

198
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:22,550
fine for the faculty<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the staff we</font>

199
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,380
block them in and things like that you

200
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:25,849
heard yesterday about some laws they

201
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,710
didn't actually apply to you very much

202
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:29,870
but it was polite it was polite for the

203
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,549
for the woman to be here to tell you

204
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,860
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> laws that didn't really apply to</font>

205
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,419
you that much these are laws that don't

206
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,990
apply to you that much but they do apply

207
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:41,270
to Oregon is it companies and either

208
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:43,099
either corporations or just regular

209
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,959
business corporations or particularly

210
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:47,630
universities or banks and things like

211
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,699
that and it's a wonderful stick to have

212
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,830
actually laws are a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and say</font>

213
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:55,370
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

214
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">this it's the law and if you violate it</font>

215
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:00,080
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not good juju and that's</font>

216
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,620
a good stick to have if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

217
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,740
foggy position that I'm in and you've

218
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">heard of most of these things the one</font>

219
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,670
you may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have heard of is that and it</font>

220
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,320
actually may apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you if you happen</font>

221
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">to collect credit cards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

222
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,730
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> dialup customers or something</font>

223
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,280
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> California law called a</font>

224
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:22,220
database security breach Act which says

225
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,600
that if you even think that you're that

226
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that you've collected the</font>

227
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,080
credit card number and expiration date

228
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,630
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you collected from a</font>

229
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,240
customer if you even think that somebody

230
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,880
has seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have to notify all</font>

231
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">California residents now you could do</font>

232
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you could not just notify the</font>

233
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,240
California residents if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to</font>

234
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:43,130
that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be remarkably bad PR to</font>

235
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,660
only notify the California residents

236
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,630
which basically means you have to notify

237
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,670
everybody but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually a a</font>

238
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">wake-up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call I've actually gotten a</font>

239
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,969
little ladder from somebody in

240
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:54,320
California saying by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop</font>

241
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,240
was stolen with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> social security</font>

242
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,860
number on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though I'm not a</font>

243
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,420
California resident but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

244
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,090
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful law for that sort of</font>

245
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:03,589
thing and it will wake up some people

246
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,930
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harvard look like Harvard looks</font>

247
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,730
like what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would expect there's no</font>

248
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,390
firewall it would be a remarkably silly

249
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,760
thing to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> university firewall as</font>

250
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:15,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">steve bell even once said about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> MIT you</font>

251
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,270
have to assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the network is in</font>

252
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,680
the hands of the enemy the MIT student

253
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,090
well we're not we don't have students

254
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,949
quite like that but they try very hard

255
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:26,900
the trade school down the street does do

256
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:31,010
a very good job of training network

257
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:32,630
attacks attackers we do have firewalls

258
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:35,360
in someone's inside some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the schools</font>

259
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,580
and they are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> silly too but they</font>

260
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,350
happen to fit into the mindset of the

261
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:42,350
folks that are running that particular

262
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,650
school they do do a very good job of

263
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:47,480
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the problems are within</font>

264
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,600
which of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the problems</font>

265
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,410
always are is within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the firewall</font>

266
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:56,140
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of good with the general</font>

267
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:58,069
model that folks use is you've got the

268
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,769
servers and then right outside the

269
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers you got to switch and then</font>

270
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:04,089
outside the switch you've got a router

271
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:05,618
and you put a CLS up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> yin-yang in the</font>

272
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,689
router and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually works pretty</font>

273
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:10,559
well and there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> some clue</font>

274
00:11:07,689 --> 00:11:12,550
lying around it's not a prevalent

275
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:16,089
quality but there's some clue lying

276
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:18,368
around and other than the students we do

277
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,499
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a monoculture software monoculture</font>

278
00:11:18,369 --> 00:11:23,889
with Microsoft the students tend to be

279
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:26,619
about forty to fifty percent max but and

280
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:28,839
I've got a mac lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of players in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

281
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture none of whom he'd be controlled</font>

282
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:34,929
the last one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

283
00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:37,149
controllable so what's my task my task

284
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:39,369
is to let<font color="#CCCCCC"> the school's think they came</font>

285
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:41,110
up with good ideas now that's a little

286
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:44,589
bit invent inventive but it actually

287
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,980
does work and then use these laws of

288
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:49,749
sticks when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can and get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bite by ins</font>

289
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,600
on the guidelines like the best

290
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:54,759
practices I spend far much far too much

291
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,910
time posturing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pontificating</font>

292
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:00,639
controlling not saying not requiring

293
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:03,009
that hence the title of the talk we're

294
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,689
not fighting worms and viruses with good

295
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:07,329
practices we're fighting them with

296
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:08,559
pontification so I'm saying hey you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

297
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:09,758
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really stupid you have to do</font>

298
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't say that</font>

299
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you never you never start out</font>

300
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:15,549
saying something stupid and getting

301
00:12:12,309 --> 00:12:17,589
their cooperation that way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> reminds</font>

302
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:21,339
the whole thing reminded me of a joke

303
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:23,470
fry the comedy routine from a group

304
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,499
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Burt and I don't know many have</font>

305
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,720
you heard of that it's an old main

306
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:31,089
comedy team and the premise<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this was</font>

307
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:34,269
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> drunk was hauled in front of the</font>

308
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:36,759
judge for falling asleep<font color="#E5E5E5"> in bed smoking</font>

309
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:38,439
and setting the bed on fire and he said

310
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:40,569
no judge that's absolutely not what

311
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:44,829
happened the bed was on fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I got</font>

312
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:46,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">into it and that's the way I feel thank</font>

313
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:48,260
you

314
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,260
you
