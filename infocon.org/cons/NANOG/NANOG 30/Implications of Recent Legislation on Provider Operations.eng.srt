of history you all probably know this

better than I do but the internet began

as the ARPANET

41
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:33,360

government to talk to its individual

parts in the event of a nuclear war and

44
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,509
a breakdown of communications and for

45
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:41,910
many many years it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by</font>

46
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,040
government folks and academics until it

47
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:46,140
was transferred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to NSF in the 1980s</font>

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,950
where it took on a whole new<font color="#E5E5E5"> life unto</font>

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:51,660
itself and grew exponentially now

50
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,250
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its academic focus in the</font>

most of its life and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was only when it</font>

53
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:59,729
became more of a commercial sort of

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,250
aspect that Congress started<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a</font>

55
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,860
look at it but as you well know Congress

56
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,619
is slow<font color="#E5E5E5"> regulation riders are slow and</font>

57
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,300
the laws did not keep up with the growth

58
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,008
of the internet and it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

59
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,470
last few years that Congress has finally

60
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,609
taken a look and see the aspects of the

61
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,350
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they see all need to be</font>

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:20,370
protected as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> American people start</font>

63
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,690
to complain about things like privacy so

64
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,160
let's talk a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about privacy</font>

65
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,049
because that's where most of these laws

66
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,690
are focused is on protecting personal

67
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:30,600
privacy information and having come from

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right now now in response to</font>

concerns about<font color="#E5E5E5"> information sharing into</font>

the the continual education of the

out there the kinds of things that are

recently that they're becoming aware of

83
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,120
this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the media so Congress</font>

84
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">has passed a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of laws in the past</font>

few years designed to protect the

for the government<font color="#CCCCCC"> to combat terrorism</font>

91
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,810
has sort of put a quash on the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

92
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,280
bills and laws that have been passed in

not find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection between laws</font>

100

that affected what happened on paper to

clearly in the 20 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have</font>

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,118
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is educate you that they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

maintain this information in a certain

269
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,949
way will require<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to do a little</font>

270
00:09:52,389 --> 00:09:55,059
research for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your clients if you're</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> handle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like financial</font>

272
00:09:55,059 --> 00:09:59,860
information and I would encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if</font>

273
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,239
you have this sort of information to

274
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,269
delve a little further into<font color="#E5E5E5"> these acts</font>

275
00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:06,959
with your with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal counsel this</font>

276
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:10,179
is not an advertisement<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyers but</font>

277
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,099
they do help sometimes now other laws of

278
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:14,559
interests that are unrelated to privacy

279
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,970
particularly for isps is one of them is

280
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,279
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act

281
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,519
this one is not particularly new but if

282
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:24,160
it continues to be litigated because

283
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,509
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of ambiguity and how these</font>

284
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,059
sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to be covered</font>

285
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:30,610
what this does is places a limitation on

286
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:33,488
liability for copyright infringement on

287
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,769
online service providers for many years

288
00:10:33,489 --> 00:10:37,720
anyone in the chain of a copyright

289
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:39,669
infringement could be sued like the

290
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,040
infringer themselves because what you do

291
00:10:39,669 --> 00:10:44,919
when you you pass along that information

292
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,230
is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a rolling infringement of</font>

293
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,029
that copyright but because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nature</font>

294
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:51,040
of online service providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> Congress</font>

295
00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:53,379
finally recognized that they had no

296
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,059
control over the information itself and

297
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:56,919
often didn't even monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

298
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:59,618
but just passed it along as a conduit

299
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,560
and as a service so this act<font color="#E5E5E5"> was passed</font>

300
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:03,600
to protect the

00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,359
service providers from<font color="#E5E5E5"> being included in</font>

302
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,430
any suit for copyright infringement so

303
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,370
it limits liability for acting as a data

304
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,229

305

transmission routing our connections or

306
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,310
making transient copies to allow a

307
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:19,050

311
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,470

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,650
system caching for a long time caching

313
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,690

314
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,130
would subject you to copyright

315
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:37,770
infringement should someone choose to

316
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:40,200
sue you because of this act no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:47,370
particularly system cashing it limits

00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,619
your liability for infringing material

you into the suit if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should be just</font>

hosting an infringing website and it

328
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,920
also limits your liability for

<font color="#E5E5E5">hyperlinking or using search engines</font>

materials the mere fact that you provide

332
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:20,070
a link no longer subjects you to

333
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,350
copyright infringement now<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

334
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,740
what it does do is allow the government

335
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">now to serve you with a subpoena to find</font>

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,950
infringing activities so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to maintain the records of your</font>

with a subpoena you're probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

342
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:44,070
have to give it up and so yet again more

00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:46,560
need for lawyers<font color="#CCCCCC"> another thing to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">consider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is coppa which is a children</font>

345
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,489
Online Privacy Protection Act I can tell

346
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:53,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you that although there hasn't been a</font>

347
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,660
lot of movement in this area this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

348
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,310
really hot button for Congress's

349
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:58,620
protecting children on the internet and

350
00:12:56,310 --> 00:13:00,250
so although<font color="#CCCCCC"> cope has come under fire</font>

351
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different angle</font>

352
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:04,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that anyone's going</font>

353
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:06,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with just freely releasing</font>

354
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,380
children's information so this

355
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,880
particular act is still enforced and

356
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,670
protects<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy of children under</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">13 by requiring parental consent for</font>

00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">information of any child and this is</font>

360
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">only going to get more stringent because</font>

361
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,939
everyone is concerned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> protecting</font>

362
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,350
children from things on the internet

363

that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't be seeing in use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

364
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:28,450
their information<font color="#E5E5E5"> so people can contact</font>

365
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">them this law in particular applies to</font>

366
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,760
commercial websites and online services

367
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,380
and so you need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

368
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,880
time that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hosting</font>

369

children's information you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

370
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,470
be more scrutinized probably than less

371
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,250
and finally there is the u.s. Patriot

372
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:47,050
Act which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very new Act it's still</font>

373
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,630
not sure how it's going to be

374
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,729
implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's being litigated in a</font>

375
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,610
number of areas because a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

376
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,920
liberal community is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very upset by the</font>

377
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,990
Patriot Act it allows the government to

378
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,699
use many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its existing surveillance</font>

379
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:04,690
tools that were never applied to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net</font>

380
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:08,080
before to try and investigate domestic

381
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,839
terrorism related activities how far

382
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,000
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to stretch is going to be</font>

383
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,410
anybody's guess I'm sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that over the</font>

384
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,570
course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next couple years as we</font>

385
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:18,480
continue the war<font color="#E5E5E5"> on terrorism this is</font>

386
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,560
going to be tested over and over again

387
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,700
but it is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to facilitate</font>

388
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,219
information sharing and cooperation

389
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:27,310
amongst government agencies which has

390
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:32,500
traditionally has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been very poor to try</font>

391
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:36,209
and find identify and deal with domestic

392
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,210
terrorism related activities

393
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay does anybody have any questions</font>

394
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:51,230
so early everyone just can't

395
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,229
don't yes go ahead

396
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:59,489
how far past nice kick please get up and

397
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:04,140
use the microphone and all<font color="#CCCCCC"> ioe well I</font>

398
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:12,000
can repeat that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want how far</font>

399
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:22,380
back do you have to record data working

400
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:24,750
yet yeah which it only goes back to the

401
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,279
passage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Act it's not before so</font>

402
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:33,560
it's not grandfather back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things</font>

403
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:35,580
which you had before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah so in</font>

404
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,369
2010<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to have to know what my</font>

405
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,930
users were doing in 1996 well having

406
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,490
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know copyright</font>

407
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:44,130
infringement cases have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> statute of</font>

408
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,560
limitations and so they're usually

409
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,300
between two and three years so you're

410

long do you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that</font>

421
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,310
information is there anything in the

422
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,170
statute or is it just keeping it from as

423
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,329
long as operationally required and if

424
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:26,040
the request for that binding comes in

425
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,700
from law enforcement during the time

426
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,740
you're keeping it you provided but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

have to keep it some extra special time

428
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,220
no there's no limitation in the statute

about how long you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep it its</font>

really left up to you how long you feel

also be subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> to prosecution for</font>

00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,500
unfortunately it may be that your this

524
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:23,210
is the way lawsuits work you're ever you

525
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,250
include everybody that you can in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawsuit try to try to start</font>

528
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,520
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourselves out so that you don't</font>

00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:34,190
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> further defend yourself or be</font>

considered as<font color="#CCCCCC"> part of the liable group</font>

531
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,990
and so unfortunately require some work

532
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:40,159
and some maintaining a documentation to

533
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,690
show that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are following</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

535
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,899
maintain that status as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

536
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:46,580

00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:48,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself from the soup okay so</font>

538
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,580
discounting for a moment the fact that

539
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:52,429
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> America and that's our</font>

constitutional right to be sued and

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:56,720
looking at the criminal side of things

542
00:20:54,039 --> 00:20:59,210
what about service providers whose

543
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,230
service is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the provision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of anonymity</font>

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,090
under the<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of laws what do you mean</font>

546
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:10,610
I'm sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah if the service that a</font>

547
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,889
service provider is providing and is the

548
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:15,820
guarantee of anonymity and privacy to

549
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:19,279
for instance a user behind a web cache

550
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:22,908
and the user goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looks at say child</font>

551
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:25,789
porn and the services being provided is

00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:29,120
a guarantee of anonymity and the service

553
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:31,399
provider is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there established policy</font>

554
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:36,110
which they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> following is to not keep</font>

555
00:21:31,399 --> 00:21:40,029
any records what liability do they incur

00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:40,029
in the criminal prosecution left

557
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,770
well teleport ins of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that example</font>

558
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,000
because they have no sympathy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you</font>

with child porn so well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's worse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

560

have the information about who they are

562
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:57,960
there are ways to track people down and

563
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:01,260
you will stay longer involved in the

not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> criminally</font>

577
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,850
or civilly sanctioned but you're going

578
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,800
to have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Justice Department there for</font>

579
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,300
a long long time if you can't offer up

580
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,070
the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need to have</font>

581
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:44,520
them further contact the people who are

582
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:46,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bad actors we'll take that one</font>

583
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,040
question back here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> close</font>

584
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,300
off yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just wanted it he mostly said</font>

585
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,970
it but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to get clarification</font>

586
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:58,200
here since you said yourself the Patriot

587
00:22:53,970 --> 00:23:00,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">Act is such a versatile law um I guess</font>

588
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,570
the cost can ride it by the way what I

589
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:05,700
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> write it so don't I believe you</font>

590
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:08,340
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is your</font>

591
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,380
explicit policy written down black and

592
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">white that you explicitly follow that</font>

593
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,230
you do not keep user usage information

594
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:18,450
that essentially provides a shield for

595
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the users if you can show hey we don't</font>

596
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">keep anything that's up front that's</font>

597
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:28,050
what we do then there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no liability</font>

598
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:30,060
under dmca or what have you is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

599
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,730
correct there is no liability for you

600
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:34,470
however having said that like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the</font>

601
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,660
Justice Department will likely camp out

602
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:39,000
with you in an effort to try and hunt

603
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,140
these people down particularly if when

604
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,380
it you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> relating to things like child</font>

605
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,850
pornography or terrorism and so what I'm

606
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,160
suggesting to you is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font>

607
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">useful to you to maintain a minimum of</font>

608
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:52,740
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can provide to them</font>

609
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,270
to get you<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from you and start</font>

610
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:56,940
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the bad actors and you'll</font>

611
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:59,940
have to deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with them that much less so</font>

612
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,210
no to thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you very much</font>

613
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,210
