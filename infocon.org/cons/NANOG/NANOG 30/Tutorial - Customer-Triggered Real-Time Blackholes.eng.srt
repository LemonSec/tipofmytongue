1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,180
my name is Chris tomorrow and Danny

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Macpherson in the white shirt and Tim in</font>

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:13,019
the greenish brown and hopefully today

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,210
we can cover a couple topics but the

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,890
main<font color="#CCCCCC"> one we're trying to hit is allowing</font>

6
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,310
customers to trigger black hole routes

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,170
in your network if they have some kind

8
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">of problem they want to not call you</font>

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:28,080
about so basically we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and hit</font>

10
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:29,699
black hole routing some of the tools

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,780
that you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually make it</font>

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:35,100
work all free we like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think how to</font>

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,989
allow the customers to trigger a black

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,809
hole and then Danny is going to talk

15
00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:42,949
about bgp flow spec which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

16
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,789
way to push out filtering through bgp so

17
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,110
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to go to every edge</font>

18
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:48,899
router you have and apply some crazy

19
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,100
filter you can put this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> into bgp</font>

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:57,390
and hopefully it will work for you there

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so yeah everyone can read the first</font>

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,420
question so how many of you all are

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,539
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for security an ISP or</font>

24
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,110
enterprise network so right look almost

25
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,150
everybody know fifty percent and how

26
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,330
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys use like a black hole</font>

27
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,130
routing scenario today so something on

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:19,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so good and have you all ever</font>

29
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,110
tried like the source base black holing

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,029
that you can use with unicast RPF one

31
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,450
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four oh very very soon for</font>

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,450
everyone

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:34,950
okay so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> rollin does do that that's</font>

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:36,930
right and as anybody currently allowing

35
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,120
customers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> blackhole traffic through</font>

36
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp announcements to you know one hand</font>

37
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:48,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so aside from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gil who can't</font>

38
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,910
raise his hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that okay so</font>

39
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:52,979
basically everybody knows kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what a</font>

40
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,080
Doss attack or a distributed now service

41
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,610
attack is just way more traffic near

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,560
customer expected for whatever reason it

43
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,080
could be a legitimate reason like

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,120
Cisco's latest you know software update

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,560
that everyone has to get or it could be

46
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the victoria secret fashion show you</font>

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,789
know these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> common examples or it</font>

48
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,800
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know I upset some little</font>

49
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:13,079
kid in IRC in a way he wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get me</font>

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,050
off the network so he tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss me</font>

51
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,180
off very simple concept so but the

52
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:19,800
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great but the important thing</font>

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,970
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's traffic your customer</font>

54
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,170
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't want or that you don't</font>

55
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">want in your network and you have to</font>

56
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,070
transit it across your network to your

57
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:33,390
customer so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost you one</font>

58
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:35,519
way or the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the whole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concept</font>

59
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,079
with really the remote trigger black

60
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,850
hole is the ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to one place</font>

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,860
in your network to put in a route that

62
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,720
will dump the traffic at the edge so

63
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,220
there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of preparation you</font>

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to do on every edge device or</font>

65
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,109
really every device in your network just

66
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:53,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">in case something slips through from</font>

67
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:54,450
provisioning or what have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

68
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,760
know you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be prepared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how</font>

69
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the tool and what effect it will</font>

70
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,320
have for both you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your customer</font>

71
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,459
alright<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the last point was that it</font>

72
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,930
this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's not the</font>

73
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,560
be-all end-all of security but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

74
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly a tool that any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp can use in</font>

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,680
their toolkit to keep going<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright yeah</font>

76
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:20,070
reach it if I didn't dislocate my

77
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,550
shoulder so it's I wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> advise you</font>

78
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:25,799
to do that if thinking about it so in

79
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,570
RNA and my network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think Tim uses</font>

80
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,250
it for the same reason I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think quest</font>

81
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:31,709
also is using black hole routing today

82
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,920
for both saving customers and tracing

83
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,690
attacks so we use it today to trace<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

84
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,429
attacks across our network used to take

85
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,510
us you know upwards of eight or ten

86
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">hours sometimes to go</font>

87
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,599
hop by hop across the network we can

88
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,959
trace an attack across our backbone

89
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:48,209
which is of reasonable size in about

90
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">five minutes right so as long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as it</font>

91
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:52,019
takes the BGP route to update and four

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,890
packets to start coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> into our little</font>

93
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">sinkhole network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what's good about it</font>

94
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:59,429
for us is we don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a reasonably</font>

95
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,840
sized network so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes a long time to</font>

96
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:02,159
go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> every edge device and try and find</font>

97
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,720
this traffic or it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a long time to</font>

98
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,040
go hop by hop through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and in</font>

99
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,019
some cases you can't go hop by hop

100
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,409
because of network design issues that

101
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:14,310
were made to actually get better traffic

102
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:16,349
performance like mpls thank you we don't

103
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:19,680
have net flow deployed but other folks

104
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:21,539
do Tim does and<font color="#CCCCCC"> qwest uses net flow and</font>

105
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,289
either the arbor devices or just

106
00:04:21,539 --> 00:04:26,760
straight using it to see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

107
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:28,139
you can do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thing with</font>

108
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,440
the IP accounting if you don't have a

109
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,949
GSR which doesn't do IP accounting at

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,840
least not in them good we have or you

111
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,310
can just sometimes attacked you can tell

112
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,219
just because the interface statistics

113
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:43,199
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> in OC 3 that's pushing 200,000</font>

114
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,520
packets per second probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not what the</font>

115
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">customer is asking for so reasonably</font>

116
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,680
simple stuff

117
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so the whole concept with black</font>

118
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,930
hole routing if when it gets right down

119
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:02,979
to it is you push out a route to all the

120
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:05,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP ibgp neighbors in your network and</font>

121
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,520
you just reset the next hop to something

122
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that every router knows is discard or</font>

123
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,909
null 0 or reject depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the router</font>

124
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have or you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

125
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:21,140
the discard interface on a Juniper which

126
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:23,660
is pretty cool so early<font color="#E5E5E5"> on very kind of</font>

127
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:28,820
had this black hole route concept along

128
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:31,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">or he's his part of it as he was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

129
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:32,480
it long time in the past and according

130
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,380
to him<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone forgot about it no one</font>

131
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:38,120
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really using it and and for whatever</font>

132
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:42,500
reason we kind of rediscovered it on our

133
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,810
network as a kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mistake which</font>

134
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,810
ended up<font color="#E5E5E5"> working out pretty well for us</font>

135
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,810
so

136
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,719
instead of trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to access list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

137
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,950
traffic everywhere which when you use an

138
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,380
access list your router has to process

139
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,180
switch the traffic or takes depending on

140
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:58,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">the platform of course it's a</font>

141
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,690
performance<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit and it's a problem cause</font>

142
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:02,100
you have to manage the access list

143
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:04,890
routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> tonnelle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 allows you basically</font>

144
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,690
to route the packet off to non-existence

145
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,710
so instead of having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to worry about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

146
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">know am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I going to go through this long</font>

147
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,950
access list and find out how to describe

148
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:13,260
the packet you just punt it often up to

149
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:14,729
null 0 in a way it goes and it the

150
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,289
router can route faster in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

151
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,000
cases depending on the platform again

152
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:22,890
can route faster than it can access<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,540
or more conveniently at least running

154
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,070
length<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the last point says little</font>

155
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">to no performance impact but again that</font>

156
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,630
does depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the platform so your 2600</font>

157
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:36,690
will probably access less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> route to</font>

158
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:39,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 at about the same rate so again</font>

159
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:44,460
we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> also thank very end Danny for</font>

160
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:46,920
doing the slides for us so the basic

161
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">conte you know as the packet comes in</font>

162
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,100
normally goes into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fib the fib says</font>

163
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,870
where am I going to put this and it

164
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,630
ships either out the egress interface or

165
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,310
in our case it you know it could go

166
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">through a packet filter to to discard</font>

167
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,300
the traffic right pretty simple on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

168
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,240
normally output because you're facing a

169
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,620
customer or if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just discard</font>

170
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,870
it it'll immediately route<font color="#E5E5E5"> the null 0 so</font>

171
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,620
you don't have to bother with the the

172
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:12,180
packet filter part so

173
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,560
everybody's favorite example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

174
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,970
customer getting attacked so all the

175
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,800
green lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the attack traffic and</font>

176
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:21,210
some poor customer in red is now calling

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,460
you saying please save me the problem

178
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,070

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,130

181
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,810
were big enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take out an OC 3 or</font>

182
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,060
in OC 12 but that was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

183
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:37,050
no one really could muster enough

184
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:38,669
bandwidth or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> BOTS as Rob likes to you</font>

185
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,740
know destroy large pieces of your

186
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:42,840
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> but now it's not uncommon to see</font>

187
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,020
a gigabit or two gigabit been with

188
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,429
attack I have never seen one that's as

189
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,010
big as two gigabit but I've definitely

190
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:54,120
seen an honest-to-god million packets

191
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,889
per second so in the 10 million good

192
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,169
stuff yeah 1 million was enough to

193
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:59,699
destroy an edge router and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

194
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:05,219
metro routers in our network very

195
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:11,100
unhappy yeah I can imagine yeah NSA was

196
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,780
not happy about that a large recording

197
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:20,940
this so if anyone has comments please

198
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:23,580
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> a user like everybody I promise not</font>

199
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,020
to sing I'm Rob from Team Kim<font color="#E5E5E5"> rube the</font>

200
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,450
largest DDoS attack for which I have

201
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,169
empirical evidence was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 gigabits in</font>

202
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:34,979
aggregate that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> for OC 192 s you could</font>

203
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:36,449
beam a human down that so you know when

204
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:38,310
you talk about d das and chris<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

205
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,650
talking about the reality is bandwidth

206
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,569
is not your answer bandwidth is not

207
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:43,890
going to save you and by the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

208
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,839
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers think that's the case</font>

209
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:48,990
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sales people don't</font>

210
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,089
necessarily mind that but you need to

211
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,760
start pointing them this way in terms of

212
00:08:51,089 --> 00:08:55,260
reacting to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pipe that's full you know</font>

213
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,160
it's not the type of attack it's just

214
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:00,420
the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's going to overwhelm</font>

215
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,339
the pipes yeah so like I said about two

216
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,900
years ago you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in OC 12 s worth of</font>

217
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,709
traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind of the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would</font>

218
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,630
see and now like Rob's<font color="#CCCCCC"> and back then the</font>

219
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:10,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">answer was oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just you have the customer</font>

220
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,709
buy more bandwidth solve that problem

221
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,449
right for you right<font color="#CCCCCC"> away but now that's</font>

222
00:09:13,709 --> 00:09:18,089
not really a viable answer anymore and

223
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,820
there's a number of competing factors as

224
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:23,640
to why that is but in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end bandwidth</font>

225
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,680
isn't going to save you so in

226
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,670
additionally it's not just your customer

227
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,920
that's suffering here if we flip so yeah

228
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,360
so if the attacks big enough which you

229
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,890
know 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> million packets per second</font>

230
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,180
that's big enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take out a pop so</font>

231
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,530
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take out your pop and some</font>

232
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,300
of your transit network to get to the

233
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,920
pop and it's definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to cost</font>

234
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,209
you money if nothing else because you're

235
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,099
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to over provision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

236
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:49,020
internal core circuits to deal with

237
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:51,480
attacks on an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ongoing basis so hopefully</font>

238
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and find some way to fix that</font>

239
00:09:51,480 --> 00:10:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so okay so if we if we use the</font>

240
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,220
black hole route concept or the remote

241
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:04,110
triggered black hole we can have a knock

242
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:06,210
work or security person like people in

243
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,520
the room here can push out this route

244
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,980
into their system Danny's quick with

245
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,689
that button and hopefully the route goes

246
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,240
out to the edge devices and blocks<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

247
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,770
traffic there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the incoming you</font>

248
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,360
know bad customer which of course none

249
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them are actually bad right the</font>

250
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:23,670
incoming bad customer interface is now

251
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,320
getting the traffic dumped well everyone

252
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,000
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> some that are bad but you know</font>

253
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:33,380
ideally<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not them that's actually</font>

254
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:37,940
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah I'm dumb facts</font>

255
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,939
look let's let Tim jump in and

256
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so remote record blackball</font>

257
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:50,240
filtering so using a bgp trigger

258
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,170
network-wide the response multi-source

259
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,170
attack low so

260
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,779
right

261
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:15,959
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> setup to set up the</font>

262
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:15,959
trigger you're gonna

263
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:36,819
okay so static route and bgp will allow

264
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,010
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> charter network wide</font>

265
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,620
destination address as quickly as bgpz

266
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,760
to converge through the network provides

267
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,600
isp is a toll essentially so looking at

268
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,730
backscatter and trace back we're out

269
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:59,290
arbitrary addresses on at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

270
00:11:51,730 --> 00:12:02,110
AT&T backbone so whenever we set up our

271
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:05,439
next hop we set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple next hops on</font>

272
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:06,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router so you can pick three</font>

273
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,190
different addresses and then you can

274
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have different tags trigger on which</font>

275
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:14,710
address you're actually going to black

276
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:16,960
hole too so in other words depending

277
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:18,940
upon the route you'll see the one ninety

278
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:21,040
one ninety two dot 0 dot to dot one and

279
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:24,220
that's got to know what the tag<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 255</font>

280
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,160
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so that might just handle all your</font>

281
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:33,420
edges of the network yet you can have

282
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,420
another community string is that yeah

283
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:47,779
so then you have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> tag 199</font>

284
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:50,060
which might<font color="#CCCCCC"> take it so that it's just</font>

285
00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:51,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're peering edge routers that's going</font>

286
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,020
to drop the packets and then you might

287
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:56,239

strings relate to the next top and how

310
00:13:52,859 --> 00:13:57,779
you can set up different edges to

311
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:59,309
respond differently you have your<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

315
00:14:11,569 --> 00:14:17,639
yeah and any tool can do this you know

316
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:20,219
if you have a unix box that's running

317
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,749
zebra it's not going to matter any

318
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:24,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that's going to inject the</font>

319
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:28,589
route so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be a you know we</font>

320
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,929

322
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:42,238
up with anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do bgp to set</font>

323
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:45,319
that route<font color="#E5E5E5"> of um yep much for this</font>

324
00:14:42,239 --> 00:14:45,319
purpose announce table

325
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,990
yeah so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was how stable is</font>

326
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:56,640
zebra for using it for set remote

327
00:14:51,990 --> 00:15:01,200
triggers we use zebra for other methods

328
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:03,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP analysis such as like I think I</font>

329
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,210
was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about pyrmont earlier as far</font>

330
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,979
as like looking at bgp routes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

331
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:11,190
enough stability with zebra in that

332
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,250
fashion we're not using it to set

333
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:16,530
triggers on the black hole simply

334
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,030
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have enough routers out there</font>

335
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:20,579
that we can pull one that's you know

336
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,890
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it but I wouldn't see any</font>

337
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:29,730
stability problems using<font color="#E5E5E5"> zebra to set a</font>

338
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:33,540
trigger so some other tool integrations

339
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:36,540
that you can do if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't find a good</font>

340
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,939
enough spot in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network to actually</font>

341
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,829
redirect into a sinkhole so you don't

342
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:44,010
have to disperse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack out on the</font>

343
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:46,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">edge you can set a particular tag or</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">into a specific location into our</font>

347
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:57,300

348
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,990
attack so at that point you know you can

349
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:03,839
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at dark address space you</font>

350
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:08,550
can look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know syntax storms warm</font>

351
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:11,580
detection we do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things with</font>

352
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:14,339

lot of unused class sees a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of unused</font>

354
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,410
class B's as long as some arbitrary

355
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,010
address space and just monitor that

356
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,900
portion of what's being<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold and</font>

357
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:27,780
try you can get warm pretty good

358
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,730
indications<font color="#CCCCCC"> of warm detection if it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> warm</font>

359
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,140
breaks out or just noise that's

360
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:33,500
happening out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet that's</font>

361
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,500
occurring

362
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,460
so recommended dedicated trigger device

363
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:50,800
I really don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it matters as long</font>

364
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:54,320
as the device is definitely secure

365
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,089
obviously you know security<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as</font>

366
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,800
the rush to your router's go if you have

367
00:16:56,090 --> 00:17:00,800
one device that's going to have the

368
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,520
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trigger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and manage other</font>

369
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,389
things in the network and reflect<font color="#E5E5E5"> on how</font>

370
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">your network is going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle this</font>

371
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,560
traffic you make sure it's secure

372
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:19,569
so the once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the attack</font>

373
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,759
dispersing into your network then you

374
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,408
some people lose methods of they're not

375
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,689
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a method in order to see</font>

376
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:29,179
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> characteristics of the attack so you</font>

377
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:31,759
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have net flow</font>

378
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:32,899
or SNMP because once you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not singing</font>

379
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,690
the network you don't want to just

380
00:17:32,899 --> 00:17:37,399
forget about it so have<font color="#E5E5E5"> way our method</font>

381
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:43,970
of monitoring the attack once it gets

382
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:45,979
dispersed into your network this looks

383
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:51,259
like a screenshot from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Danny's company</font>

384
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:54,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">Arbor this is there traffic right yeah</font>

385
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:56,779
so this is traffic traffic essentially

386
00:17:54,649 --> 00:17:59,629
looks at net flow and you can see some

387
00:17:56,779 --> 00:18:03,739
charts up there so in our case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

388
00:17:59,629 --> 00:18:05,869
Danny's product<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arbor and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when the</font>

389
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:07,399
attack when we disperse the attack if we

390
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:10,340
do a tag that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to disperse</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

391
00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:12,559
attack out onto the<font color="#CCCCCC"> out onto the</font>

392
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,029
backbone we look at our flow records to

393
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,769
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that you know see if the</font>

394
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:17,299
attacks gonna ways that we can remove

395
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:19,190
the trigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at least get the</font>

396
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:22,090
characteristics of the attack see where

397
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,090
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting from</font>

398
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:40,330
okay so this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

399
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:41,860
the tag so you have your your router

400
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:43,840
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you reached you have to</font>

401
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,979
redistribute static in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP in order</font>

402
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:53,110
to get the static route you're going to

403
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:55,630
set in the BGP 60 there you're setting

404
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,799
the next top 192 dot 0 dot to dot one

405
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:01,410
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be in your route map</font>

406
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:06,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's going to put it out to festival</font>

407
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:08,010
set local preference 50 all the routers

408
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:10,540
are going to respond appropriately

409
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:12,669
secondly no export you don't want this

410
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,760
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this exporting</font>

411
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:19,179
out to your other ISPs that are going to

412
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:21,760
be listening you just want this to occur

413
00:19:19,179 --> 00:19:23,820
on your network and set origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp for</font>

414
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,820
you

415
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,610
okay so then the activated all you're

416
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:35,270
simply going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is set the static</font>

417
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:37,550
route and tag it 666 and you can see

418
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:40,690
from up above match tag 666 that's going

419
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,690
to set the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop value</font>

420
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,170
and once the BGP once the router that's

421
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,420
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the advertisement it's</font>

422
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:58,310
going to know where<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that packet</font>

423
00:19:56,420 --> 00:20:01,690
for its next top that next<font color="#E5E5E5"> top is going</font>

424
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,690
to be static routed to null 0

425
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:13,300
this is how it's going to travel

426
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:27,250
so bgp you're setting the route the next

427
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,080

when you base for

436
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:12,650
so why community-based triggering

437
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,910
flexibility allows for more control on

438
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:19,100
dos<font color="#CCCCCC"> dedos reaction my car saying earlier</font>

community one can be for all routers on

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,790
the network we need you too can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

444
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,620
under attack and it's easy enough to

445
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,879
just say okay every router and the

446
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,360
network is going to we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

449
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:48,800
black hole you're essentially doing a

450
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:50,600
deny any any on that IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address so you</font>

451
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,250
want to have some choices on where

452
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,379
you're going to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic through</font>

453
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:56,420
if you know the attack the attack

454
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:58,850
traffic is strictly coming in through

455
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:01,820
your peering connections then you can

456
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:03,230
set a tag that the customers are your

457
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:04,850
customers are<font color="#CCCCCC"> still going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

458
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:09,200
reach your customer that's under attack

459
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:11,209
or in our case on the AT&T backbone we

460
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,640
have a lot of downstream what we

461
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:16,160
consider downstream service providers so

462
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,530
we want to differentiate peers between

463
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,840
downstream service providers in between

464
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,700
our customer edge and also our broadband

465
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">bej so having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those different</font>

466
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,680
communities if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to cut off</font>

467
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:29,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSPs from sending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this attack</font>

468
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,820
traffic or just appears from sending

469
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">this attack traffic and still allow some</font>

470
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,470
of our larger customers to access the

471
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:38,500
customers under attack is always a good

472
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,500
thing

473
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:46,659
enter provider mitigation this is

474
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:49,840
currently something we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing but</font>

475
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:54,360
essentially how it works is you have is

476
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:57,459
PA that is now blocking the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

477
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:01,600
they're sending out an advertisement

478
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:03,400
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop EGP yeah that that is</font>

479
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,209
then going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a remote</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trigger to</font>

480
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:11,970
other ISPs so you can grow this larger

481
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:17,410
than just your own network it robs yeah

482
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,850
hey Tim um yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22 flavors of this what's</font>

483
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:22,330
your name<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you from there I'm very</font>

484
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:24,550
green and civilians to two flavors of

485
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,350
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> indenter provided mitigation is one</font>

486
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,419
with the advent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sec were</font>

487
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,030
providers security professionals from

488
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,530
different providers can find each other

489
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,820
people who do remote trigger black hole

490
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,870
and then find each other and put an

491
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,520
ounce but he'll for me so allows manual

492
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:42,159
because you got to go everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to</font>

493
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,400
say so that works and we also have tools

494
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,660
like the remote trigger I mean the

495
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,230
automatic black hole system that route

496
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:52,210
runs right so there's another technique

497
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,380
so so we have a couple couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

498
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,640
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and routes going to come up and</font>

499
00:23:53,380 --> 00:24:03,460
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about with you a plug for his</font>

500
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:05,440
service so team kim<font color="#E5E5E5"> roo runs a what we</font>

501
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,370
call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ddos route server project some</font>

502
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably familiar with the</font>

504
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,780

505
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:16,540
inject a / 32 with a particular a s and

506
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:19,149
community so that you can watch it know

507
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it or filter it as you wish so you</font>

508
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:24,760
appear with this we've got multiples of

509
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,800
them now and we will guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as</font>

510
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,870
much as we can determine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this / 32</font>

511
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:33,070
is the command and<font color="#E5E5E5"> control for a botnet</font>

512
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,169
if you wipe out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the command and control</font>

513
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,790
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only are you saving your customers</font>

514
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:38,200
because now they're machines are still

515
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,270
infected but can't actually participate

516
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:42,550
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> doss you may be preventing a Doss</font>

517
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,960
from hitting one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your customers so</font>

518
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:46,360
it's sort of a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> medicine thing to do</font>

519
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,890
so if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that send us</font>

520
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,000
email we'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to set up hearing</font>

521
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,920
with you and if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">about our methodology and how we know</font>

523
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,519
that / 32 is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

524
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:58,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">be willing to talk to you about that as</font>

525
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:59,980
well and like like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob was saying it's</font>

526
00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to save you time in the long</font>

527
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,679
run I know everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Rob sun's out</font>

528
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,120
as far as the botnets go I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,049
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know I set up my own</font>

531
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,480
IRC server and have them attached to me

532
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:15,460
and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what they're up to and</font>

533
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,230
then I get other complaints from people

534
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,789
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> cert saying hey I attached to this</font>

535
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:22,210
and you're running like this pot<font color="#E5E5E5"> nenem</font>

536
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:26,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">like no no it's really well tacky if you</font>

537
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:28,600
don't shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so but it does save you a</font>

538
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,240
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and effort some of these</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just looking at our own customers you</font>

540
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,409
know from some of our broadband will

541
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,850
have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400 customers 500</font>

542

544
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:43,149
you in the long run when somebody comes

00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:45,010
out and says hey your networks attacking

547
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:54,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a definitely less pain painting so</font>

548
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">we got more providers setting up routes</font>

549
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,189
to know their own black hole in traffic

550

God shoes with black hole filtering

551
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:07,210

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:26,199
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> your ios-based I can tell you</font>

two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we were hampered by a hell</font>

hampered by now but um with anything

562
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:35,350
like this make sure you check over your

563
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:38,529
hardware your iOS revisions and make

564

yeah you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand up and talk on</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that very they're agreeing against cincy</font>

00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,629
mean this goes back where it goes to the

570
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,428
next next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide to with that the AGS was</font>

571
00:27:06,629 --> 00:27:11,549
had this all didn't put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

572
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:13,590
AGS had this issue where null<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros all</font>

573
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:16,440
process switched so if you did anything

574
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:18,869
to null 0 your CPU one kaput<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

575
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,389
so the technique that we used to do was

576
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:24,749
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people remember to</font>

577
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:27,539
AGS a few people in here your dayt

578
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:29,369
yourself but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the techniques I</font>

579
00:27:27,539 --> 00:27:30,899
know I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do on my all my 80s is</font>

580
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:33,619
but I didn't wear Francisco I work for

581
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:36,330
you know providers then is we took a UI

582
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:39,658
connectors and put a t-connector on it

583
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:41,369
and then we would and this is of course

584
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:44,309
people call this they drop interface now

585
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:46,740
right you know and that was a drop

586
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:50,340
interfaces so you would shunt it off to

587
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:52,139
a ethernet that had a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> t-connector</font>

588
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">right and if you pump enough packets off</font>

589
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:57,178
the t-connector make it hot and you can

590
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:59,220
cook<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know but that's</font>

591
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,320
the context of this that they just in

592
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,059
these these days of<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop and pack has</font>

593
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,189
got to understand your platform how it

594
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:07,249
drops the packet I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

595
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,409
context of this and even today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

596
00:28:07,249 --> 00:28:12,299
you know cpu oriented platforms drop

597
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:14,610
differently than ASIC oriented<font color="#E5E5E5"> clockwise</font>

598
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:17,668
and if you understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how each platform</font>

599
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:21,619
drops then you can use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fordin to</font>

600
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:21,619
your advantage to drop very effectively

601
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so real quick on this actually I</font>

602
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:38,080
saw one hand on the the RPF source-based

603
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp black holes and basically what you</font>

604
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,540
do is you employ the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp trigger</font>

605
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,550
mechanism and associate a you RPF filter

606
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,780
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a with a no entry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or discard or</font>

607
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,820
reject depending on what your router

608
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:51,040
vendor is and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use that to do</font>

609
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,840
source-based BG pipe bgp black calling

610
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,790
as opposed to destination based and so

611
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:58,780
that's all that was intending to

612
00:28:54,790 --> 00:29:02,649
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so customer triggered</font>

613
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:04,300
a basically when after you got all the

614
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,710
bgp black holing infrastructure and

615
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,470
configuration and all the preparation

616
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:10,300
work done what you can do is you know

617
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">after you begin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using it for yourself to</font>

618
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,020
you know to mitigate attacks and stop to

619
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,909
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> ACLs you can start accepting more</font>

620
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,170
specific prefixes from customers to

621
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:20,590
allow them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> blackhole</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their own</font>

622
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:22,240
prefixes so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

623
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,800
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm on source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bates</font>

624
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,690
bgp black in other words allow your

625
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,129
customers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> blackhole other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sources on</font>

626
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,530
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network because you know that could</font>

627
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:30,730
be a das attack in and of itself you

628
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:32,830
definitely want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scope their black</font>

629
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">holing capability to prefixes which they</font>

630
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,169
they announced to you I think that's

631
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,910
pretty intuitive and and then you also

632
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:42,700
you only want to accept more specifics

633
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:45,340
of prefixes from customers you know for

634
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:47,830
you know that they announced the only

635
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,480
problem with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is that that</font>

636
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:51,129
unless depending on how you do your

637
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,940
filters like a lot of service providers

638
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:58,000
like a couple min or several source

639
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,950
writers accept a prefix from their

640
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,840
customer or any more specific of that

641
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,390
prefix or any longer you no longer mask

642
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,510
on that prefix and so they'll accept a /

643
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,640
16 or / 24 within that implicitly within

644
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:10,629
their BGP policy on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other hand a lot</font>

645
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,280
of service providers actually have

646
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,230
explicit filters to say I'm only going

647
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,720
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept this last 16 from you because</font>

648
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:18,220
it helps their keep their customers from

649
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,450
you know announcing more specifics and

650
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:21,490
you know how save the Internet routing

651
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,770
table not not everyone's concerned with

652
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:25,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment but not getting a</font>

653
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:28,570
good says how their policy is fine but

654
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:31,389
the problem with having explicit<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix</font>

655
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,770
filters is that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got explosive</font>

656
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:35,020
filters in place and you want to accept

657
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:36,340
more specific prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> and customers then</font>

658
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:39,220
you got a policy there and it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

659
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:41,350
accept this / 16 from you know from from

660
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,140
this customer a of mine and I'll accept

661
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:44,668
any you know and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept</font>

662
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,259
the

663
00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:47,909
a black hole community from them you

664
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:49,619
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply a policy that says I'll</font>

665
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:51,960
accept any of these prefixes more

666
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:53,789
specific to that with this community

667
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,259
associated with the in tagging know<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

668
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,299
port and not announce it off my network

669
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:58,769
and whatnot so so one of the things I've

670
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,600
talked to a couple of router vendors

671
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:03,450
about actually is having a mechanism to

672
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,759
say here's an explicit policy filter set

673
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,129
and I accept I accept this or anything

674
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:10,259
longer with this defined community and

675
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:11,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">tag it you know with this community so</font>

676
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:13,649
that you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have one explicit</font>

677
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:15,119
prefix filter set and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to</font>

678
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:16,799
define another one that says or these

679
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,939
more specifics with this community so

680
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,609
that I won't link these rocks off my

681
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,460
network so that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to thank</font>

682
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:26,220
anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good someone follow me</font>

683
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:28,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright accepting longer prefixes I</font>

684
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:31,080
think already talked about this actually

685
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:34,139
yeah so we've already talked about this

686
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was covered in the last slide okay</font>

687
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:37,979
so more on customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> triggered routers</font>

688
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:39,359
these are the wise basically and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

689
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,149
you know mean time to repair mean time

690
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">to response liability for example if a</font>

691
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:45,119

00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:50,668
one liable they can you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can</font>

695
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,928
<font color="#CCCCCC">get it as chris says you know when they</font>

696
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:53,399
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it where they want it and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

697
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:55,049
it's on their timeline so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

698
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:57,748
lag and delay that says they send an

699
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:59,519
email to security at you know isp calm

700
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,779
and have to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you know four hours</font>

701
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,950
or four minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever it is</font>

702
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:05,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're going to complain about because</font>

703
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:07,799
the tax no longer occurring<font color="#CCCCCC"> tag routes</font>

704
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,029
with no exporter and you know so so

705
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,889
basically if you accept these routes

706
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:12,570
from your customers you probably don't

707
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,889
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to announce them to other peers and</font>

708
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:16,109
depending on what policies that you have

709
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:18,600
in place so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know exports kind of a</font>

710
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:20,789
safe net community hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

711
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,070
providers have explicit communities to

712
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:24,389
say I attached this community and unless

713
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,889
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> community is there I'm not</font>

00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:27,869
announcing this community to peers

715
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:30,748
because implicit filtering often results

716
00:32:27,869 --> 00:32:32,009
in route leaks right so and then the

717
00:32:30,749 --> 00:32:33,929
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you see in this bullet is no</font>

718
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:36,210
advertise so depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you set up</font>

719
00:32:33,929 --> 00:32:37,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">your your black hole architecture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

720
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,899
one of a couple of ways you could have

721
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:42,450
your trigger device could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a client or</font>

722
00:32:39,899 --> 00:32:44,008
you know an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ibgp or ebgp beer of one of</font>

723
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:46,799
your ibgp speaking routers in your

724
00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:48,210
network and then that allow that router

725
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:50,519
to announce it to every other router in

726
00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:52,409
the network alternatively for faster

727
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,210
deployment or security or maybe you want

728
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:56,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have subsets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of policy that trigger</font>

729
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:58,290
device could have an ibgp session with

730
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,750
her you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a BGP session with every</font>

731
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,460
device in your network and so so that it

732
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,630
immediately sends one update to everyone

733
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have to rely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on you know</font>

734
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">the convergent time that it takes to get</font>

735
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the update through your network it</font>

736
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,840
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you want to architecture</font>

737
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:13,500
solution there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

738
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,480
different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could do that so all</font>

739
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,860
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's that we're going to</font>

740
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">be out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of me so one of the other things</font>

741
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,689
with this is timelines like talking to

742
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:23,699
Chris and Tim are and they both said

743
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">they usually have about you know three</font>

744
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,690
to five hundred active you know no

745
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,580
routed or black hole droughts in their

746
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:30,810
network at any given time chris said

747
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,000
it'd probably be lower if he did a

748
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,440
better job at keeping you you know

749
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,610
keeping up but he's got you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know he's</font>

750
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:37,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">got some tools and he says you</font>

751
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,290
definitely want to keep some exception

752
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,270
policy in place that says this says I'm

753
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:43,770
gonna put<font color="#CCCCCC"> this no route in for two days</font>

754
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,060
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> either automatically going to</font>

755
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:46,740
be withdrawn or someone's got to

756
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,300
acknowledge it you know another<font color="#E5E5E5"> alert up</font>

757
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,370
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want this to be</font>

758
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,020
this you know this dirty you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know wash</font>

759
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,219
bin that you throw everything in and

760
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,570
then when someone calls and complains

761
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,920
you take it out again you definitely

762
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,679
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do exception reporting and</font>

763
00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,330
monitoring and auditing of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

764
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:01,620
so so having<font color="#CCCCCC"> a random trigger router</font>

765
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,090
with some what I made a process that

766
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,350
someone goes in and figures a static

767
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:05,610
route with a network statement and

768
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,860
announces something out in your network

769
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,299
that that that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you don't</font>

770
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">have tools on the back end of that it</font>

771
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,820
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably turn into you know a bit</font>

772
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:16,168
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a cesspool yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so actually</font>

773
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is the enhanced policy language</font>

774
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:20,069
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about to me it's a big deal</font>

775
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,300
because I've worked at a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours</font>

776
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">service writers and I know that the</font>

777
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,160
explicit filters were important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

778
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:28,049
and and I don't want to define two sets

779
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,449
of policy so again accepting more

780
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,310
specifics of a prefect defined prefix

781
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:34,259
set if the community is attached<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

782
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:36,330
then you know tagging and no export or

783
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,940
whatever what other ever extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> beaut you</font>

784
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,520
want to attach so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so that's</font>

785
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that before we go on are there any</font>

786
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,969
questions on that's pretty much it on

787
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,889
you know bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> black o routing customer</font>

788
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,779
trigger black holes at the moment this

789
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:50,879
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically an extension to that</font>

790
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,440
to PDP flow specification stuff but does

791
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,910
anyone have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions about this or</font>

792
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,780
comments or observations before we go on

793
00:34:55,909 --> 00:35:03,000
nothing

794
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:04,590
okay all right fine so so a few of<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a</font>

795
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,440
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us have talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the problem</font>

796
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:09,000
obviously many people in this room of

797
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,710
either destination bleh store just

798
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,240
source-based black holing and you know

799
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:13,920
one of the biggest problems with it is

800
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you effectively complete a denial</font>

801
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,540
of service attack unfortunately you know

802
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:20,940
so someone attacks you know Rob's house

803
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,560
and it gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> yuh mean it you know he's</font>

804
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,450
getting slammed and so everybody black

805
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,980
holes it and well yeah you know he's not

806
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting slammed anymore but he can't get</font>

807
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,610
anywhere anyway so they've effectively

808
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,890
completed the das attack right and so

809
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously you want to be as specific as</font>

810
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:34,500
possible you know the attackers are

811
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:36,089
getting more intelligent they're not

812
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,310
stupid and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> application-level</font>

813
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:40,500
attacks on web servers like some of this

814
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:42,480
goes stuff that kind of thing are in our

815
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">reality but at the same time if it's</font>

816
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,630
pretty mundane then you could say you

817
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:49,740
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter everything to you know to</font>

818
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:51,030
UDP port 53 on this device and and you

819
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">know and be more specific about</font>

820
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:55,140
mitigating attack as opposed to taking a

821
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,660
host or a set of hosts offline and so

822
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the drivers for this for</font>

823
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:02,279
this draft actually is that that if you

824
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,140
want to you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it like a discontinuous</font>

825
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,300
set of IP addresses or a set of port

826
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,740
ranges or you know depending on how you

827
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,060
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know how you how you've</font>

828
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,649
architect if you want to do source and

829
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,360
destination base you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

830
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,630
fixed set of prefixes and still employee

831
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,370
employee bgp black holing then you can't

832
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,960
do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp you got to push filters out</font>

833
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,370
in your network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain filters and</font>

834
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,410
augment filters and hope the line card

835
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have support that hardware filtering</font>

836
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:28,980
capability all those sorts of things and

837
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:30,330
so basically but we wrote a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did</font>

838
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,820
this with a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other folks and</font>

839
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:35,220
actually before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it yeah so it specifies</font>

840
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,170
some procedures for defining a flow

841
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,750
specification within<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp and we'll talk</font>

842
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:43,230
about the philosophical issues with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

843
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,480
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we finish but up and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

844
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,130
know it basically allows you we define

845
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">to new address fan or a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

846
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,870
family and sub address family in BGP and

847
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,850
basically allows you to include<font color="#CCCCCC"> encode</font>

848
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,560
you know like I protocol types port

849
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,660
numbers ranges of addresses what I and a

850
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP update so from a trigger router I</font>

851
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:01,440
could I could black hole a you know a

852
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,880
set of a source addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set a</font>

853
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,650
destination addresses on a given port

854
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">given protocol from a central point in</font>

855
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:07,470
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and so long as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

856
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,390
forwarding logic and my router vendors

857
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,288
implemented that I wouldn't have to

858
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:11,879
augment 50

859
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:13,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred you know router filters in my</font>

860
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,029
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I wouldn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go push</font>

861
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:16,169
it out and you know change 15 things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

862
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:19,019
can do this from a central point<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

863
00:37:16,169 --> 00:37:21,739
network so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know what what</font>

864
00:37:19,019 --> 00:37:24,178
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to progress in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGF so</font>

865
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:26,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so flow specification it's an</font>

866
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:28,079
n-tuple this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just talking</font>

867
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:29,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do with that then</font>

868
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,499
once it's defined it's very much like

869
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:32,849
bgp black<font color="#E5E5E5"> hole routing you could say you</font>

870
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:34,589
know attach a green community which

871
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:36,630
means on all ingress interfaces<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

872
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:38,279
to drop this this address family cell

873
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:39,509
address family this this defined filter

874
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">i want it applied</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to these interfaces</font>

875
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:42,359
and then you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that</font>

876
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:43,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre-configured in your network so you</font>

877
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:45,660
can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer interfaces and custom</font>

878
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:47,249
interfaces and all interfaces or core in

879
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,529
our faces or sinkhole interfaces or

880
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:51,029
whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want and so so you</font>

881
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:52,979
can define those sets and then you can

882
00:37:51,029 --> 00:37:56,459
trigger that with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp a single bgp</font>

883
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:59,218
update you know into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network so all</font>

884
00:37:56,459 --> 00:38:01,288
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you know for ddos</font>

885
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:03,209
mitigation and then it's kind of a you

886
00:38:01,289 --> 00:38:04,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">know a natural evolution from that sense</font>

887
00:38:03,209 --> 00:38:07,198
<font color="#CCCCCC">i guess the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is the natural</font>

888
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:08,279
evolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> for dos attacks or application</font>

889
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,410
layer and they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking production</font>

890
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:12,719
services often so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

891
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:13,859
arguable from that front but you would

892
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:15,650
traditionally there was destination

893
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:17,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">based black hole routing than you r PF</font>

894
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:19,919
source based stuff and now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

895
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:21,569
allow you to encode explicitly anything

896
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:24,179
basically in a packet header match that

897
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:25,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that you want to filter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> honor</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

898
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:26,789
know we're four distinct call it could

899
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:28,169
be the same mechanism that's something

900
00:38:26,789 --> 00:38:30,869
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the distinctions we didn't make</font>

901
00:38:28,169 --> 00:38:32,429
but everything you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with bgp black go</font>

902
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,869
growling it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function of setting the</font>

903
00:38:32,429 --> 00:38:36,630
next top and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to set your</font>

904
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:38,309
next hop to a sinkhole device or some

905
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:40,199
kind of analysis workstation that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

906
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:41,729
of thing it's simply a matter of putting

907
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:44,189
a different different address there and

908
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:47,189
having the device capable of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

909
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:49,469
parsing the data and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

910
00:38:47,189 --> 00:38:51,509
nananana before very very green and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

911
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:53,189
actually talked about talked about

912
00:38:51,509 --> 00:38:55,289
sinkhole routing and all the mechanisms

913
00:38:53,189 --> 00:38:57,589
are exactly the same as<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you just</font>

914
00:38:55,289 --> 00:39:00,630
set the addresses to different set so

915
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:02,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and then this the flow spec stuff</font>

916
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,829
obviously it's much more precise so

917
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:06,689
ranges you don't need 500 routes for 500

918
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:08,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">discontiguous you could put you know put</font>

919
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:13,529
a range of addresses in their sources

920
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:14,729
destinations<font color="#E5E5E5"> porter ok and then how many</font>

921
00:39:13,529 --> 00:39:18,119
folks in here actually read the draft

922
00:39:14,729 --> 00:39:20,279
the bgp flow specification draft how

923
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:22,859
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> PR so I saw two hands of those to</font>

924
00:39:20,279 --> 00:39:25,569
do either of you care about this

925
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:26,500
taking a poll here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so good I fifty</font>

926
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:30,490
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people in the room that</font>

927
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:32,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">there were smelly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great so no so uh</font>

928
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:36,459
so basically we<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't are yourself</font>

929
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:38,259
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good out there and I care so</font>

930
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:41,349
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably will start packing on</font>

931
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,940
headed editing on it keep it going<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

932
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:46,000
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think think about</font>

933
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:47,650
this where we're going with this one you

934
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,039
know the whole idea this whole block

935
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:53,529
whole bit is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we are providers who</font>

936
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,359
control big backbones and we control how

937
00:39:53,529 --> 00:39:57,039
packets flow and all we're doing is

938
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,828
control on the bad packets and happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

939
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,690
flow in a certain direction and so

940
00:39:59,829 --> 00:40:05,230
remote trigger black hole is very good

941
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:08,440
for layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> three destination well that</font>

942
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,180
that's very coarse and then unicast RPF

943
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,980
loose check gave us source and

944
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:13,930
destination so now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two tools we</font>

945
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,240
can we can drop based off source we can

946
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">drop a stop destination but as it seemed</font>

947
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,229
with different attack patterns out there

948
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:22,000
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually need to have that sort of</font>

949
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:25,390
speed you know the speed you can get

950
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,970
like something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like in tins or a chris's</font>

951
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:29,890
network and have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something happened like</font>

952
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,660
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in 60 seconds you're having a</font>

953
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,430
black hole triggered hall across their

954
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">here about two huge backbones you're</font>

955
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:38,019
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need that at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> layer for you need</font>

956
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:39,848
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> into you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet size you</font>

957
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:41,348
need to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the port numbers to</font>

958
00:40:39,849 --> 00:40:43,029
respond to some of these incidents<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

959
00:40:41,349 --> 00:40:44,799
these worms out there and that's what

960
00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:46,930
the flow spec is is taking us down the

961
00:40:44,799 --> 00:40:49,119
path I've given another tool that we can

962
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">go down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do that so why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should you</font>

963
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,240
care about this this is why you should

964
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:54,430
you should care about this because

965
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,308
something like this you you don't want

966
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,569
to happen just with one vendor this

967
00:40:57,309 --> 00:41:00,549
needs to be on all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font>

968
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:02,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">equipment out there because you want to</font>

969
00:41:00,549 --> 00:41:04,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the choice option of picking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

970
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,569
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment for your network whatever</font>

971
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,559
that that vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be and you want</font>

972
00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:10,450
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this to be able to work</font>

973
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:11,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">on it so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should care</font>

974
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,808
about this and participate in this

975
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,490
effort and say your two cents about it

976
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:17,170
and read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and keep keep track of</font>

977
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:19,390
it and then when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets to a point</font>

978
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:21,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">where you can turn around to your</font>

979
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,319
vendors are and your network and say are

980
00:41:21,309 --> 00:41:25,180
you going to do this right because you

981
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:26,259
know you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> control the purchase</font>

982
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,819
orders and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you could say are you</font>

983
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:31,000
going to do this so that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

984
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:33,290
should care about this effort

985
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any other any other comments on</font>

986
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:37,070
that front so yeah we plan to continue

987
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:38,270
progressing this either within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

988
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:40,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Grove working group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the eye dr</font>

989
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:44,240
working group within the ITF and

990
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,740
understand it's actually pretty pretty

991
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,319
bad right now is best flying it you know

992
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:50,000
flexible filter specification language

993
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">or float specification language and so</font>

994
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,230
we plan to extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i got a link</font>

995
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the next page the other thing</font>

996
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,530
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know if any you know how</font>

00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:05,330
discussing the ITF right now routing

1001
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:06,980
protocol overload and you know and some

1002
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,990
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> even argue that using you know</font>

1003
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:10,430
bgp black hole routing alone is

1004
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:12,290
overloading bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know with a control plane</font>

1006
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:16,759
that's uh it's exploiting things that

1007
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:18,529
could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know effect you know affect</font>

the network inversely you know as

1009
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:22,099
opposed to how they wanted to do then so

1010
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,200
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a member of Dave Meyer know</font>

1011
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:25,609
if he's around I saw a moment ago but an

1012
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,379
eye on a few other folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a</font>

1013
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:29,779
design team in the ITF there was you

00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:33,410
overloading routing protocols are we you

1019
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,490
kinds of stuff in BGP and so does

1020
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,439
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this belonging bgp it's a</font>

1021
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,000
valid question and if it doesn't belong

1022
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,710
in BGP where's that belong is a new

1023
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,030
protocol and are you actually to you

1024
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:51,170
know willing to deploy<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new protocol</font>

1025
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,490
your network that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things so</font>

1026
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,200
that's an argument in the discussion

1027
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,640
that's that's taking place and if you

1028
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,580
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback on that as well you know</font>

1029
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:00,170
we're certainly open to listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> John</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guy</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Danny junker stuff with Northwestern</font>

1031
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,070
University I would say it probably

1032
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:05,480
doesn't belong ideally in BGP although

1033
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:07,450
it's a it's pretty interesting idea and

1034
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,530
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a try just in practice</font>

1035
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:12,259
Steve Gil and I talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1036
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:14,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">while back as well I like the idea of</font>

1037
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:17,359
maybe push back as a separate mechanism

1038
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:19,970
to do it for a couple reasons one

1039
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,369
because it makes vtv bgp a little bit

1040
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:23,359
easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change if you ever need to do</font>

1041
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:25,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> without having to carry this</font>

1042
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,038
baggage with it

1043
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,408
but if you did try it may be at least a

1044
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,209
separate bgp session to do this specific

1045
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:34,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">year as opposed to coupling of your</font>

1046
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:36,049
existing by outing stuff right now then

1047
00:43:34,609 --> 00:43:37,429
it's certainly valid and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1048
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:39,349
something that that's viable with

1049
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:41,299
address families as you know anyone here

1050
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,679
that's configured or recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> seized ten</font>

1051
00:43:41,299 --> 00:43:44,538
different address family you know sub

1052
00:43:42,679 --> 00:43:47,509
address family you know configuration

00:43:47,509 --> 00:43:52,519
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> some folks do that today for</font>

you know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like ipv VPN lri with bgp</font>

1056
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:56,629
that sort of thing as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so yeah</font>

1057
00:43:54,499 --> 00:43:59,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a good good comment any other</font>

actually here and you saw there you know

1060
00:44:01,489 --> 00:44:06,349
it's got its got the author names and so

1061
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:07,789
actually the link isn't there is it do

1062
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:09,709
they put it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> here there it is so</font>

1063
00:44:07,789 --> 00:44:11,269
that's that's linked to drafted the

1066
00:44:12,859 --> 00:44:17,269
no one's had time to do the work and so

1067
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:18,619
that's the name<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm danny it TCB net if</font>

1068
00:44:17,269 --> 00:44:20,538
you want to you know have questions or

1069
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:23,989
comments or whatever but that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was it for</font>

1070
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:25,399
the bgp flow spec stuff and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd</font>

1071
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:26,749
like to thank Barry you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1072
00:44:25,399 --> 00:44:28,939
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides came from Barry Barry Barry</font>

1073
00:44:26,749 --> 00:44:30,138
and I and several other folks can

1074
00:44:28,939 --> 00:44:32,598
contribute to<font color="#E5E5E5"> something called the</font>

1075
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:34,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">security boot camp and and we you know</font>

1076
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:36,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000 slides there now I</font>

1077
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:38,479
guess and you know it's how to do

1078
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:40,309
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> from management to control</font>

1079
00:44:38,479 --> 00:44:41,569
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> datapath preparation and you know</font>

1080
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:44,179
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot for your network and</font>

1081
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:45,589
actually all the all the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1082
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:48,049
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> available here so if you're</font>

1083
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know for some good</font>

1084
00:44:48,049 --> 00:44:51,079
things to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network</font>

1085
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:52,759
from you know from packet filtering to

1086
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,979
whatever there's a link there and it's

1087
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:56,119
kind of up well well over 2,000 slides

1088
00:44:54,979 --> 00:44:57,499
there's a bunch of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> decks that</font>

1089
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:59,179
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a look at how to prepare</font>

1090
00:44:57,499 --> 00:45:01,098
your network precisely to do these sorts

1091
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:03,439
of things and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the caveats and</font>

1092
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:05,329
whatnot and then also brian who works

1093
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:07,729
with chris<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think he still works there</font>

1094
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:09,139
worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with chris so he was an early</font>

1095
00:45:07,729 --> 00:45:10,129
contributor to a lot of the bgp black

1096
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:12,769
hole rallying and some of the

1097
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:15,069
backscatter stuff as well so see where's

1098
00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:15,069
ya now

1099
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:24,200
say he got out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the big carrier world</font>

1100
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,480
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's oh he's he's moved on to</font>

1101
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,799
new things so today yeah Brian was the

1102
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,140
other guy but very did a lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1103
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,910
these slides and I did some<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so and</font>

1104
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,470
then obviously Tim and Chris both for

1105
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:36,529
you and gave us lots of feedback so that

1106
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:38,779
was pretty much it I don't know if folks

1107
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:40,220
in here have questions or comments or if

1108
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:41,840
something is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear you want to talk</font>

1109
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,069
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you're probably not the</font>

1110
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:45,230
only one so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got something I want</font>

1111
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:49,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring up with the mic feel free to to</font>

1112
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:50,990
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on up no one everybody's going back</font>

1113
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:54,799
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> South Beach they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to hurry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1114
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:56,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">again okay good when you know Wayne</font>

1115
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,730
verizon internet services I just

1116
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering if anybody had any comments or</font>

1117
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:03,680
feedback you mentioned up there that but

1118
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:04,880
the mechanisms to monitor the routes get

1119
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,109
your black holing like once you put

1120
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,670
static right in your going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to black hole</font>

1121
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:10,580
you mentioned tracking five hundred

1122
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">some-odd routes you know perl scripts</font>

1123
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,970
you know web front into something

1124
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:16,130
homegrown what are people using the to

1125
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:18,439
monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> and track those black holes and</font>

1126
00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:20,000
when they take them out there's a two

1127
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,910
types of monitoring that we use in our

1128
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">network and inside the unit for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MCI</font>

1129
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:29,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet backbone so we have some</font>

1130
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:31,370
homegrown stuff that net inch has to

1131
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:35,660
just watch growth and change in the

1132
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:38,330
route table both in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP and in BGP</font>

1133
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:41,240
so they do some tracking of it there for

1134
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:43,130
what for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> for our step really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1135
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,540
more abuse based or security based and

1136
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:46,130
it's kind of our responsibility to take

1137
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:47,900
care of it so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a ticket system</font>

1138
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:52,160
that manages all the abuse information

1139
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:54,260
and ideally myself or James<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gill who's</font>

1140
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,270
here one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other three people that</font>

1141
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:58,190
do that are supposed to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1142
00:46:56,270 --> 00:47:00,080
check<font color="#E5E5E5"> their tickets and make sure that</font>

1143
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,880
it's a appropriate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to still be black</font>

1144
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,350
hold what that means is you take black

1145
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:06,590
hole off and if the customer calls you

1146
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:09,319
then you have to put it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but but</font>

1147
00:47:06,590 --> 00:47:11,540
I think Tim you said you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> arbor to</font>

1148
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,160
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> product to washing that blow yeah</font>

1149
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:15,230
so we

1150
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,629
we generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a net flow at the</font>

1151
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:22,130
ingress when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're it's getting dropped</font>

1152
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:24,260
we also look at our<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp going to the</font>

1153
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:28,280
address that's getting set at the next

1154
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:30,260
top as far as like removing black hole

1155
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:33,020
routes though it really relies on our

1156
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:36,140
ticketing system we get a ticket we put

1157
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,930
it seven days out we notify customer

1158
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:40,279
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we after we notify customer</font>

1159
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:43,549
care two days later I get to removed

1160
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're told otherwise and so you</font>

1161
00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:47,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to end up with just a</font>

1162
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,849
place that's going to have thousands

1163

upon thousands of / 32 out it onto<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1164
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:54,530
router so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> made it very clear that</font>

1165
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,109
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up a procedure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1166
00:47:54,530 --> 00:48:00,440
remove these things regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

1167
00:47:57,109 --> 00:48:02,779
response we get from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer care</font>

1168
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:05,329

1169
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,280
seven days out we contact customer care

1170
00:48:05,329 --> 00:48:08,690
telling them<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to remove it</font>

1171
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,880
two days later and it gets removed

1172
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,970
unless we're told to keep it and then we

1173
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,230
do repeat the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven days out two</font>

1174
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,230
days and we remove it

1175
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:25,259
okay Barry Barry Greenhut is for Tim and

1176
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:27,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chris since you're allowing customers to</font>

00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:30,510
say give<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a community and with this</font>

00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">routing on my network which is kind of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">like the paradigm I love we trust our</font>

1186

filtered we've gone through our

00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:56,040
provisioning system to ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

route filtered check it on to check it

00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,620
twice check out a third time it's our

1190
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,090
biggest fear is that a route filter

1191
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:06,270
route map will get removed from the

1192

1193
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:11,580
so we have ensured that check control

1194
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:15,420
mechanisms are in place in order to do

1195
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:18,060
that yeah we have very similar setup I'm

00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:24,540
to check to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure every customer</font>

1201
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,049
when they send us the community there is

1202
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:33,270
there was initially some fear about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1203
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:36,120
customer being able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> affect routing on</font>

1204
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:38,700
our network but i think what when<font color="#CCCCCC"> wins</font>

1205
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:42,630
out as you let them aside from the

00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:45,330
standard RC 1996 498 filtering where

1207
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:47,330
they can or route map where they can you

<font color="#CCCCCC">know change local craft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or you know add</font>

00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:54,570
their routes if you let<font color="#E5E5E5"> them just do the</font>

00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:56,760
black holing all you're letting<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1212
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:59,190
do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw their own traffic away so as</font>

1213
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,810
a funny case sprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> canada decided that</font>

1214
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:02,430
they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start using the black</font>

1215
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:06,270
holing and they accidentally set it on

1216
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:07,740
all of their routes so they sent us like

1217
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:09,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">500 routes or whatever and every single</font>

1218
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">one of them is tagged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the black</font>

1219
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,540
hole community and they call in we're

1220
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:14,300
not getting any traffic well you

1221
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually asked not get the traffic right</font>

1222
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:19,770
so you know customers can shoot

1223
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:22,750
themselves in the foot which which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1224
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:25,480
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem but</font>

1225
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:27,640
in the end this helps out us helps out

1226
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,740
me and galaxies and get waking up or

1227
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:31,870
woken up but it helps a customer because

1228
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:35,109
as we pointed out it's on his time or

1229
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:37,060
her time it's it's what they want more

1230
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:38,620
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> less and they can check it whenever</font>

1231
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,080
they need you they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to call in</font>

1232
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:42,400
and wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gil up at four in the morning</font>

1234
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,490
and maybe miss types his password a

1235
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:48,850
couple times and 20 minutes later yes

1236
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:51,520
you're still under attack you know so so

1237
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:54,970
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see the need of the existent</font>

00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:14,170
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> check the route map set up for</font>

customers but they can only send us<font color="#E5E5E5"> 701</font>

1245
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:21,670
community anyway so 71 72 73 or 1454

1246
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,970
whatever the latin american AS IS it's

1251
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:32,380
you give us a call and set it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up because</font>

00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:36,250
there isn't set up on our side that has

do anything and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it actually I</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know kind of pointless to have it so</font>

1261
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:57,540
if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> figured out some of the other</font>

1262
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:01,660
communities they could do things like

1263
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:03,730
not send this route to peers but what's

1264
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,890
the point of that for them right and

1265
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">then do you have a document for your</font>

1266
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:10,569
customers for all this to show them how

<font color="#E5E5E5">to do all it I believe that that net</font>

haven't chosen to talk about to do we

1315
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:17,370
things that get attacked more often than

1316
00:54:14,430 --> 00:54:19,440
not so well over ninety percent are your

1317
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:22,830
mama wears combat boots the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed calm</font>

1318
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:25,530
right and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person who owns that IP</font>

1319
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:27,210
really doesn't care about that IP right

1320
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:28,800
more often than not they just want the

1321
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:30,150
attack to stop so there T one with their

1322

five shell servers will continue to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

1323
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:36,030
again right it's not very often like a

1324
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,200
very large site like ebay or amazon or

1325
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:39,210
somewhere like that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting attacked</font>

1326
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,240
and they call the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ebay is on customer of</font>

1327
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:44,910
ours anymore I don't think but the point

1328
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:46,709
being large larger sites are really

1329
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:48,540
important stuff on the network doesn't

1330
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:51,060
get attacked as often as unimportant

1331
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:54,110
piddly crap that can go away<font color="#CCCCCC"> and no one</font>

1332
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:56,250
cares<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so first off that you know</font>

1333
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:58,410
scope the problem that way do you really

1334
00:54:56,250 --> 00:55:02,910
care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the host or not some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1335
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't some people do so it probs going</font>

1336
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,410
to give me some statistics in a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1337
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:08,640
tell me<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm wrong but but anyway so for</font>

1338
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:10,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those sites that do matter</font>

1339
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,779
right if somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer of</font>

1347
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:29,880
we really can't have that down right and

1348
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:31,140
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> understandable so you work as</font>

1349
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,880
quickly as you can to find the ingress

1350
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,650
point for the attack and and block it if

1351
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,750
you can

1352
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:38,329
right if the equipment allows you and

1353
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:42,170
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> also something that the to get the</font>

1355
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:46,670
to prevent the collateral damage it's a

1356
00:55:44,029 --> 00:55:48,680
lot easier the black hole the traffic

1357
00:55:46,670 --> 00:55:49,849
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it into you know you can put it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">into a sniffer or something like that</font>

1359
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:53,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and look and examine the statistics of</font>

1360
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:55,220
the ax traffic and then go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1361
00:55:53,150 --> 00:55:58,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">place a filter on it so it is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1362
00:55:55,220 --> 00:56:00,500
method for just analyzing what what what

1363
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:01,940
the bad traffic is and then going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

1364
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:04,039
and placing some other form of

1365
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,319
mitigation yeah but your<font color="#CCCCCC"> question really</font>

1366
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:07,849
is like so I black hold this and it's in

1367
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">buckle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for six months and I take off the</font>

00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:11,809
backhoe<font color="#E5E5E5"> and still getting attacked what</font>

1369
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:14,900
am I the ISP supposed to do about this

1370
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:16,880
right more or less and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a harsh</font>

1371
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:18,349
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> Osby but what does anyone go to do</font>

1372
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it right I think we can all</font>

1373
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:24,859
imagine kind of a worst-case scenario

1374
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:27,680
where it's a really broad based d<font color="#E5E5E5"> das of</font>

1375
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:29,839
really important targets right it's it's

1376
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,460
it's not going away by itself right it's

1377
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:33,589
important targets it's multi-protocol

1378
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:36,170
and it's from you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font>

1379
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:37,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">thousand sources all right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nine it's</font>

1380
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:38,990
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety-nine percent of them out</font>

1381
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:41,599
there arts you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mama wears</font>

1382
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:43,009
combat boots and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you know seven</font>

1383
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,349
days later the attacks not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1384
00:56:43,010 --> 00:56:47,299
there any longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there is those ones</font>

1385
00:56:45,349 --> 00:56:48,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are persistent that you know it's</font>

1386
00:56:47,299 --> 00:56:50,779
going to last for as long as they can

1387
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:53,569
sustain the attack and that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1388
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:55,369
matter of at some point in time you have

1389
00:56:53,569 --> 00:56:57,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">to collectively start tracing it back</font>

1390
00:56:55,369 --> 00:57:00,319
and contacting other providers you know

1391
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:01,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">nsp suck is really good about that I do</font>

1392
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:03,500
you get one that's persistent you know I

1393
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:05,240
can shoot something out to that group

1394
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,890
and you know we can eventually track it

1395
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:09,319
down and stop it

1396
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:13,700
nothing formal though yeah and more

1397
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:15,319
normal terrible to be short so when you

1398
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,000
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS attacks one of the things</font>

1399
00:57:15,319 --> 00:57:19,549
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're probably not doing while</font>

1400
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:23,539
you're being hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this goes to Tony's</font>

1401
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:25,160
question is why why was this customer

1402
00:57:23,539 --> 00:57:27,069
hit big or small<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really doesn't</font>

1403
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:29,420
matter<font color="#CCCCCC"> rank why was this customer hit</font>

1404
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:32,150
there's a there's a reason it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1405
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:36,200
random there's a mission and in some

1406
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:38,480
cases it's for pay and in a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font>

1407
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:41,000
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> several thousand dollars us per</font>

1408
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,480
dose attack and once that missions

1409
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:46,460
accomplished the attack will stop

1410
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:49,250
because I person met the SLA you've

1411
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:52,609
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> these terms they use these terms</font>

1412
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:56,510
they have contracts so once the missions

1413
00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:58,819
accomplished move on because the reality

1414
00:57:56,510 --> 00:58:01,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">is if you build up a very large botnet</font>

1415
00:57:58,819 --> 00:58:04,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you're going to do DDoS for hire you</font>

1416
00:58:01,099 --> 00:58:06,740
don't want to lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> that botnet if you</font>

1417
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:09,410
fire that botnet up against ebay and do

1418
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:12,529
a fire-and-forget for three weeks you're

1419
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:13,700
going to lose<font color="#E5E5E5"> that botnet now here's the</font>

1420
00:58:12,529 --> 00:58:17,269
good news for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you who built</font>

1421
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:20,779
botnets they're easy to build that aside

1422
00:58:17,269 --> 00:58:22,609
if you're in it for profit then you have

1423
00:58:20,779 --> 00:58:24,470
expense and you have revenue and you're

1424
00:58:22,609 --> 00:58:27,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to measure these and guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1425

1430
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:41,480
botnets it is fun to watch them compete

1431
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,160
over there botnets to you you'll notice

1432
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:44,390
if you hijack a botnet server or

00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:10,609
remember the attacks on the anti

1444
00:59:08,299 --> 00:59:14,538
spammers right those were pretty

1445
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:16,339
significant right before that the

1446
00:59:14,539 --> 00:59:18,769
spammers had reached out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these people</font>

1447
00:59:16,339 --> 00:59:19,910

1450
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:26,569
this much money they do it well then the

1451
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:29,808
guy running the botnet caught a clue

1452
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:32,930
wait a minute my botnet will also send

1453
00:59:29,809 --> 00:59:34,670
spam I don't need this guy what's worse

1454
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:38,359
is I know he doesn't have a botnet yah

1455
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:39,829
yah and so you would Doss me then go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1456
00:59:38,359 --> 00:59:43,369
the sponsor back there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I've got</font>

1457

better s la's now he's doing dasa and

1458
00:59:43,369 --> 00:59:48,680
spam for hire what you hear a lot in the

1459
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,180
press and certainly from the security

1460
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:53,180
community which is my favorite comedic

1461
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:56,990
enterprise is that the next worm that

1462
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:58,220
comes out will kill the internet all of

1463
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:01,430
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> will kill the internet how many</font>

1464

<font color="#E5E5E5">have killed the internet yeah but I've</font>

1465
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:09,558
not slept so clearly the internet is

1466
01:00:03,589 --> 01:00:10,880
still up that would be fun so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

1467
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:12,109
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why aren't they going after the</font>

1468
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,240
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> because folks that's how they</font>

01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:16,369
make their<font color="#CCCCCC"> money the internet is not the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that does happen makes sense so to your</font>

1475
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,700
point you know are we ever going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:34,848
multi-protocol not yeah probably is that

1478
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:36,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be your everyday is that what's</font>

you'd be surprised you don't have a

1483
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:57,620
botnet you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to go down go</font>

01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,050
was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting a couple of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font>

1493
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:23,840
ago you know one of my colleague called

1494
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:25,190
and say hey this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool all my</font>

cable customers are getting cleaned<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1496
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:29,480
I'm not doing anything because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

1497
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:32,900
a miscreant going through with this

1498
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:35,690
latest scope you know trojan and going

1499
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:38,300
in back doors breaking into it<font color="#CCCCCC"> patching</font>

1500
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:39,710
it installing their own new trojan so so

1501
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,850
the scope problem was going away on this

1502
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:42,290
cable provider because this guy was

1503
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:43,700
going to our this is good i could take

1504
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:44,810
all these and build my own botnet so

1505
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:47,109
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through and grip and throw</font>

1506
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:49,460
them and sorry their own botnet

1507
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:50,930
opportunity all right<font color="#CCCCCC"> atropine or</font>

1508
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,490
opportunity and you get this weird

1509
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,810
reaction where they're going through and

1510
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:55,430
patching it because they don't want

1511
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:57,830
anybody else to take over it right it's

1512
01:01:55,430 --> 01:01:59,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">their new weapon and what are they going</font>

1513
01:01:57,830 --> 01:02:00,500
to use it for so the question is now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1514
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,390
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these computers that are</font>

1515
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,430
patched from the old thing they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

1516
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:07,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">new thing in there what are they going</font>

1517
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,029
