00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,259
good morning class I don't know you're

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,510
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> asleep so I was asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a</font>

3
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:10,530
short history the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,030
from the government and I don't know

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,910
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll help or not but I'm going</font>

6
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to give a short history of the internet</font>

7
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,250
so why why<font color="#CCCCCC"> did we do why was this thing</font>

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,590
done that is now called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,448
well as the divergence of views we just

10
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,420
heard Diane said it was to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

11
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:30,960
from nuclear attack some people believe

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that some people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't Larry Roberts</font>

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,399
says that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all to share big</font>

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:37,529
expensive computers Paul Baran at the

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,649
same time with showing us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep little</font>

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:42,050
charts of how you would how messages

17
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:44,700
would go through even if half the

18
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,459
routers in the world were destroyed as

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,230
long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you had enough redundancy I</font>

20
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,390
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the the bottom line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

21
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,849
it wasn't that the reason that the

22
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,960
ARPANET was done because of who was done

23
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,520
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> larry robertson company funded by it</font>

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,140
was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was to protect us</font>

25
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,030
against nuclear war but that was an

26
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,890
excuse that was an excuse that was used

27
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,549
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> Defense Department to say we'll</font>

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,750
spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money on it but but this is a</font>

29
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:11,490
discussion that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will go on for quite a</font>

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,420
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suzanne wolves this morning asked</font>

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:26,210
attack me later so so what was there at

35
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time what was what was the</font>

working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this were confronted with it</font>

39
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,840
was the phone net<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the phone company</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a proper geek it's a circuit</font>

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,229
based environment sumed a simple and

43
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,140
predictable interconnection between the

44
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,970
endpoints the phone the black phones

45
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,950
assumed a requirement for quality of

46
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,500
service a particular quality of service

47
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,030
and it was assumed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that everything was</font>

48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:04,020
carrier provided nothing was these

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:05,850
random<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad-hoc things it was carriers and</font>

50
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,000
it was voice but maybe a little date<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

51
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:10,820
pitched in but it really wasn't

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,380
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was wrong with that nothing and if</font>

53
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,970
all you wanted to do was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk and talk</font>

54
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Joe and you just wanted the one</font>

55
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,280
service here's a question what does the

56
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:25,070
fast busy signal mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the telephone</font>

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:26,600
network out of trunks well that's the

58
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,850
technical reason that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technical</font>

59
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,440
explanation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the philosophical</font>

60
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,570
explanation is actually a little bit

61
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,090
different it's that the phone company

62
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:36,950
has decided that<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather than providing</font>

63
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,660
you with the service of less quality

64
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,429
than they'd have determined that you

65
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:44,320
should get they will provide you no

66
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:48,470
service at all can you spell socialism

67
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,299
and if you liked what<font color="#E5E5E5"> AT&T was providing</font>

68
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,470
remember this is pre break up if you

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,270
liked what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were providing you</font>

70
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,890
thought they were innovators then there

71
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,320
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing wrong</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network that</font>

72
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,390
was there well a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people didn't</font>

73
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,230
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the above</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they wanted</font>

74
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:05,059
something different so they went off and

75
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,799
and then didn't make their own didn't

76
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,120
build their own they made it on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

77
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,340
what was there and actually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

78
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,570
important detail they're a bunch of

79
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,250
unrelated efforts and they were

80
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,829
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> unrelated efforts for a long</font>

81
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,940
time Paul<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marin and larry roberts didn't</font>

82
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,140
know each other didn't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">other's work even though it was</font>

84
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:23,958
effectively the same until quite late in

85
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,489
the game Larry<font color="#E5E5E5"> claims that Paul's work</font>

86
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,440
has nothing to do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> what came out of</font>

87
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,590
it that came out as the internet and

88
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,519
others claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does but who knows</font>

89
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:35,680
so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of miscellaneous</font>

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,680
efforts going on and it was a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font>

91
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:43,670
it the it was turned along in various

92
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:47,660
low levels of our grants for a long time

93
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">and as ted ted kennedy put it the RFP</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">wrong in his congratulatory message</font>

we're up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> four hosts and 69 and public</font>

98
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,440
demo and email and all that kind of

99
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:06,410
stuff in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Washington DC and 72 but what</font>

100
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,670
was it that was being<font color="#E5E5E5"> made here it</font>

101
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:10,040
certainly wasn't what was already there

102
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:12,530
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that telephony thing so what</font>

103
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:16,159
was it it was packets first of all

104
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:17,750
datagrams very weird concept in the

105
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,400
phone world because

106
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,779
packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't actually predict where</font>

107
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:22,669
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go because their</font>

108
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:24,619
decisions are made<font color="#CCCCCC"> at hockley at the</font>

109
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:27,050
individual devices and individual

110
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,400
routers there's no predictability in

111
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:31,880
this thing therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be any</font>

112
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:35,650
quality of service so it was a pop

113
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,390
couldn't possibly work but try it anyway

114
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:41,570
the uber goal according this list of

115
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:43,700
bullets here is from Vint Cerf who said

116
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,190
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were the basic goals for the</font>

117
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,930
Internet Protocol suite first of all was

118
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,700
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use existing networks this is the</font>

119
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:51,850
uber goal this was the goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> above all</font>

120
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,930
goals don't build your own network

121
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,400
because if you build your own network

122
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:57,890
that you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get it done it's too</font>

123
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,530
expensive but if you and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use</font>

124
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:02,990
what's there and make and understand

125
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,760
that what's there is not consistent then

126
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,770
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch out the networks</font>

127
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:09,590
underneath it as you go as they evolve

128
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,680
and keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> going so you use existing</font>

129
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,320
networks with<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist with multiple</font>

interval operations management systems

131
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,159
and distributed management on all of

133
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,320
something that the ATM people didn't

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,990
understand the 18 at the ATM network the

135
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,210
concept behind the ATM network that the

136

ATM forum and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the like was pushing for</font>

137
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:36,200
many years was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the network not a</font>

138
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,370
network but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network I once asked</font>

139
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:42,469
John<font color="#CCCCCC"> McQuillan to ask the his ATM year 3</font>

140
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:44,229
or whatever it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting whether ATM</font>

141
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,250
was the last networking technology

142
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:49,070
because of course if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're writing your</font>

John a little bit later second goal the

153
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,739
first of the sub-goals was survivability

154
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:18,020
so maybe this nuclear attack thing had

155
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,700
some current currency but it was

156

survivability not necessarily in the

157

of this was on purpose the POS goal it's

very beginning but they were being paid

by DARPA to do this stuff and they were

00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,719
which was compartmentalized and was no

187
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,740
that's a key feature was that the

from one end to the other end which

190
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,990
meant that you and I could create our

Braden a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of years ago by saying</font>

00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,990
that efficiency wasn't a goal it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

201
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">though there was a adaptive adaptivity</font>

202
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,960
is a much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> important goal simplicity</font>

203
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:08,150
and uniformity is important it is not

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,000
efficiency this is a complete puzzlement

205
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,729
to the phone world the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF we have this</font>

twin brothers who don't like each other

213
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:34,159
it was a interesting challenge working

<font color="#E5E5E5">in that kind of environment so we came</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">just watch it</font>

220
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,300
debug it by just looking at it well it

221
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,920
was not efficient enough for the phone

222
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,748
people they had to have a binary version

223
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,279
so if you go look at the standard

224
00:08:49,749 --> 00:08:53,769
there's two appendices one for asking

225
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,480
one for binary because it was three

226
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:58,360
percent more effective more efficient to

227
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,920
do the binary version and that was what

228
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,709
they were focused on because they were

229
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,779
mired in the old world where they've got

230
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:08,319
9600 baud lines they have to fill<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">/ / filling those in a matter of minutes</font>

236
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,019
we were never a certain concerned with

efficiency were concerned with

238
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:28,360
flexibility so what did they were they

00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:30,730
being the traditional networking world

240
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,990
think the internet was this new thing

<font color="#CCCCCC">the snoop that Datagram thing was well</font>

248
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,759
definition you can't do it because a

corporate data network has all of these

<font color="#CCCCCC">qualities service controls in it and</font>

251
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,970
tcp/ip doesn't have these controls so

252
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:03,939
therefore you can't build<font color="#E5E5E5"> a corporate</font>

get into the value chain by charging

430
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,530
more money for better quality well

431
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,140
probably charge more money for better

432
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,869
quality is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet works too</font>

433
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,400
often Michael Dell quaintly put it it

434
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,919
fails<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail often enough so it looks</font>

435
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,310
like works so what I'm doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> my voice</font>

436
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:18,700
over IP calls from my office or from my

home<font color="#E5E5E5"> over my home / I comcast net it</font>

438
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,380
just works almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time</font>

439
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,589
so here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's a question how many</font>

440
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,580
here no one integrated access devices

441
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:29,230
let's see whether you're awake you all

442
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,460
should know that integrated accident

443
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:33,010
device that little box you put on the

444
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:34,390
end of a DSL line or cable modem has a

445
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,100
phone jack on the side you plug your

446
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,860
phone into an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet jack in the back</font>

447
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,179
you plug your data network into and they

448
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,770
want you to plug your phone into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

449
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,970
phone jack and make a call<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they know</font>

450
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,650
when you're making the<font color="#E5E5E5"> call because it's</font>

451
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,660
a special connection and they charge you

452
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,250
for the call now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet</font>

453
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,180
phone you plug in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet jack you</font>

454
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,380
make a call they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know you're</font>

455
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,000
making collie no charge you but they

456
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,400
don't charge you for it that's an

457
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,110
intelligence test I don't think enough

458
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,930
people are going to fail<font color="#CCCCCC"> that test to</font>

459
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:01,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">make this a viable business but they</font>

460
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,340
have hopes carriers have hopes Dave

461
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:07,750
Clark said he was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to one of the</font>

462
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:08,800
the cable companies about this about the

463
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,060
fact that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just plug an</font>

464
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,250
ethernet phone and it would just work

465
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,649
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy thought for many said well I</font>

466
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,120
know how to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not work it's</font>

467
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:21,370
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the right approach but</font>

468
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:23,439
that's the approach that they had so I I

469
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,959
talking to the Harvard person in charge

470
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,910
of the Harvard phone network and she

471
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,010
says yeah well this voice over IP stuff

472
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,350
I don't know the fact that it works is

473
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,690
makes me nervous because it shouldn't

474
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,820
work I can't prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

475
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,050
keep working so<font color="#E5E5E5"> she doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what</font>

476
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,639
she actually wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll it out it</font>

477
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,930
works just<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine we've got it in a couple</font>

478
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">of buildings and it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing just fine</font>

479
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:44,200
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't want to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whether we're</font>

480
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,410
to roll it out because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> shouldn't work</font>

481
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:55,660
so now I've got the obligatory topology

482
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:57,430
maps we've got 69 71 7790<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 minus</font>

484
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,860
was the backbone folks and they just

485
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,110
that was theirs they were backbone

486
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,479
centric little story behind this picture

487
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,280
this is an alternate view of 91 the

488
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,320
first time I saw this picture was in

489
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,940
vancouver british columbia at a see a

490
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,500
net meeting up there and the folks from

491
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,330
mci came up now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't the geeks</font>

492
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,950
for mci these were the you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

493
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">level up their marketing people who</font>

might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> understood IP if you</font>

495
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:28,870
pronounced it carefully but<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't get</font>

496
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">much further than that so they came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

497
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:33,699
and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is maturing</font>

498
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:35,710
this is now a service

499
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,840
back to that picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Pompidou Art</font>

501
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,049
aren't hanging out so we're going to

502
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,668
draw this as a cloud and we're going to

503
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:46,179
draw the connections to it and you don't

504
00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to know what's inside they were</font>

505
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,549
extremely puzzled when we try to explain

506
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,110
what traceroute was they couldn't really

507
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:55,029
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this they didn't really like it they</font>

508
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:59,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">went back to their technicians and asked</font>

509

them to block traceroute the response

510
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:03,250
was sure if you know if you actually

511
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,689
don't want the network to run the other

512
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,190
thing that was kind of annoying was this

513
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,200
particular picture was being presented

514
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Canada and the call and this was a</font>

network was a big black cloud hanging

00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:13,709
over Canada the Canadians didn't like it

good<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the time</font>

525
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,629
that al al gore was claiming it was

526
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:40,149
being claimed to claim to invent the

527
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:43,570
internet but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw earlier al did</font>

528
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:45,549
produce did fund help fund the high

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:47,740
performance computing initiatives who

530
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:49,000
actually got us to where we are didn't

531
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:51,850
invent it he just provided the money

532
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,320
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's a</font>

533
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:55,990
version one version of where we are

534
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:58,168
today this is a topologically correct

535
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:01,720
view of the arc internet architecture

536
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:04,419
and here's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one this is the more</font>

537
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:07,889
pretty view I can't figure out damn

538
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,889
thing out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this but it's really cute</font>

539
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,059
so psychological timeline so we've been

540
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,309
following this internet thing and what's

541
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:16,960
it been doing I remember back there I

542
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:19,090
was playing around<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this thing for a</font>

543
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,179
long time I got my<font color="#CCCCCC"> first account in late</font>

544
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:23,860
70s on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power of 10 on the ARPANET</font>

545
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:25,389
and we were punking around in there it

546
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,299
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun had a lot of</font>

547
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:29,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">good time those days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was geeks geeks and</font>

548
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:31,990
students actually those days<font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

549
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,450
geeks because actually like we at

550
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,909
Harvard could not let the students on

551
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,500
the ARPANET because at that point the

552
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:41,200
ARPANET was only for a government-funded

553
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,809
research so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had to block the students</font>

554
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,250
out until CS net came along CS net made

555
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:48,639
a deal with the ARPANET which<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font>

556
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:50,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can let any student or any</font>

557
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,810
faculty member or any staff member at

558
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:55,090
Harvard use email not ftp but we could

559
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:58,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">use email so I was growing along there</font>

560
00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:00,340
and then a bunch of company a bunch of

561
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,560
companies started joining I chose IBM

562
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:05,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dec particularly because those are</font>

563
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,929
two companies where all of their era

564
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:09,969
corporate push was for proprietary

565
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,620
protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yet there were major</font>

very strongly it was not the corporate

the railroad so bang the world died and

00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:35,940
it sort of trickled up this is the

they had actually made a profitable year

623

a whole year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they didn't lose</font>

626
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,960
raise expectations a little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,690
so we're actually get back into it back

637
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,629
along the line we've had a bunch of

Metcalfe at his parade column he went

670
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,960
off and he and I did dueling columns on

671

this cut on this topic of<font color="#CCCCCC"> weather unit</font>

through doom colored glasses he didn't

00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:53,129
like that my column claimed that

677
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,230
actually a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problem was the</font>

678
00:26:53,129 --> 00:26:56,730
press which since the press doesn't

679
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:59,039
vaguely understand what this internet

680
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,450
thing is it's all magic they can easily

681
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,070
believe the magic<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go away and the</font>

682
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:03,629
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing will collapse something like</font>

falling out of the sky but my editor

685
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:11,459
actually at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> my newspaper cut out</font>

though that was actually problem and

689
00:27:15,529 --> 00:27:21,450
then there's John<font color="#CCCCCC"> McQuillan ATM is the</font>

John John sold out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ATM just about the</font>

693
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,869
right time because about time people

realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't going to be</font>

just engineering sounding picture moving

it's all just engineering simply

engineering one does want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovate if</font>

you don't actually can't see the picture

770
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,700
here this is an experiment or in a

00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:54,080

the experimenter imitations a good thing

775
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,500
it helps you learn if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to be a</font>

as innovation on this thing we call the

everything else is just engineering from

what we had before how much how

folks who are starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring us VoIP</font>

and look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vantage's ad on the web you</font>

can't distinguish it from verizon's

lists the same set of services there

imitating the phone network and if

00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:29,179
you're imitating phone network how are

you doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovation there's nothing</font>

00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,140
so they can regulate it so they can

816
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,690
understand it but you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

can't get away from it's got to be what

we already know we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,429
sure it stays good I said sounds like a

00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:27,830
understand this phenomenon then we've

857
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,980
got these carriers saying they're doing

858

new networks sprint put out a press

859
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:34,139
release just a year ago now

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,470
which happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contain information</font>

861
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:38,279
from a press release two years before

00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:41,699
which said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were getting</font>

internet ready and IP ready and really

864
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:46,379
what it meant was they're deploying ATM

865
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,018
this is the future this is people who

866

868
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,619
expanded that acronym by thirty percent

869
00:34:53,940 --> 00:35:00,859
and made it so it's thirty percent

870
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:03,569
better we call an MPLS instead right

<font color="#E5E5E5">Verizon SBC and bellsouth are trying to</font>

etc etc then there's another view which

1001
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,020
is a carrier centric view it's all the

1002
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:14,330
carriers and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do voice</font>

1010
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:32,920
from telephone companies I'm dumping on

00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:35,420
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> business but that's the way it goes</font>

where we started and uucp in the like

community networks that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture of</font>

1016
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:52,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nets put up like</font>

1017
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:55,630
like project utopia in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Colorado which is</font>

1018
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:58,780
fiber in the communities this is going

00:40:55,630 --> 00:41:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to the future</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or we can look at the</font>

telephone model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a slide from a</font>

telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> company presentation which</font>

00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,080
says that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best endeavors internet</font>

1023

which is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australian presentation</font>

1024
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,130
so its best endeavours my best effort

1025
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:14,920
will be paralleled with a carrier

1026

provided IP carrier-grade network IP

1027
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,590
network maybe maybe again you guys are

00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,570
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to survive and actually give us an</font>

00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,320
there's a bunch of decisions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">think we're actually quite critical</font>

1036
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:39,850
are today existing networks etc etc I so

1037
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:41,880
turned down tcp/ip so it's not a

actually build a commercial<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:55,990
we've had almost no regulation we're

same thing as regular telephony even

though we can't say what voice over IP

1054

is is instant messaging voice over IP
