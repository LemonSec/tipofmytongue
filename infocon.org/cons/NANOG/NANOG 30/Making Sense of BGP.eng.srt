00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:07,350
hello the title of the talk is making

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,240
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PGP this work is done in</font>

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:13,518
collaboration with when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jacobson and</font>

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,170
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an overview of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the talk we've</font>

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,839
developed two techniques to help

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,840
diagnose<font color="#E5E5E5"> pgp problems the first</font>

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,198
technique is a visualized visualization

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:33,269
technique<font color="#CCCCCC"> core temp which helps you</font>

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:35,250
visualize a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp routes and the</font>

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,219
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> technique is an analysis</font>

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,980
technique<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs stemming that helps you</font>

13
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,860
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> would cost analysis both of these</font>

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,410
techniques are driven purely by bgp

15
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:51,989
events they don't have any built-in

16
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:56,069
models statistical or otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

17
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:58,620
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is to see the world as</font>

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,780
the routers see it we're not trying to

19
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,000
map the whole internet like some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

20
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,090
research are doing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great work</font>

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,710
but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is is a routing diagnostic</font>

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:16,320
tool this is an architecture of how the

23
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:20,309
two techniques fit together on the top

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,100
is tamp the visualization technique<font color="#E5E5E5"> cam</font>

25
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:27,150
takes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp event stream or a subset of</font>

26
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp event stream and can spit out a</font>

27
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,860
static picture it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also track the</font>

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,919
events and spit out a dynamic picture

29
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,850
and animation at the bottom is the

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,400
analysis technique stemming what it does

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,250
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the root cause analysis and it can</font>

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:48,030
spit out a one-line diagnosis or also a

33
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:50,549
future set of the event to fit into the

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:55,680
visualization technique and this is the

35
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">only coupling between the two parts so</font>

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,680
these techniques can be used separately

37
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:06,570
or together we'll first go over the

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:10,379
static version of Tam Tam stands for

39
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:13,769
fresh hole and merge prefixes now this

40
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:17,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">is how it works for particular bgp peer</font>

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:22,560
and a specific time that peers route

42
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:25,260
from a tree at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> former tree</font>

43
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,410
rooted at that pier so what the tree

44
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:33,480
look like is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp pier as the root</font>

45
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:38,489
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp next hops the next hop a s and</font>

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:41,940
then the rest of the AAS we assign a way

47
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:45,019
to the edge in the tree as the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

48
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,120
unique prefixes that edge carries

49
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:52,019
because we are interested in the edges

50
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,709
the part of the tree that carries most

51
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:57,989
of the prefixes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

52
00:02:54,709 --> 00:03:01,170
now what we get would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a pretty bushy</font>

53
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:04,769
tree just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be cheap route bgp routing</font>

54
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:07,559
works so what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is prune all</font>

55
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:11,190
the edges that have went below a certain

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,430
threshold what we get then is a subtree

57
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:18,540
of the original tree but still rooted at

58
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:21,269
the same pier now we construct<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

59
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">subtree for each bgp pier you have</font>

60
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:29,010
interested in and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> combine the</font>

61
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:31,500
subtrees together by<font color="#E5E5E5"> combining we can't</font>

62
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,450
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> add the edge weights together</font>

63
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:38,549
simply because the edge actually carries

64
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:41,730
we the edge weight is the number of

65
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:44,190
unique prefixes so what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

66
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,849
to keep the set of prefixes on the edge

67
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,280
and essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> union of this of</font>

68
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:55,230
these sets and take the size of the

69
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:59,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">Union as the new edge way now Tim can</font>

70
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:02,939
map any prefix and any set of routes and

71
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,280
by picking different sets it can

72
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:08,280
validate what you think your<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP routing</font>

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:13,970
looks like or can help diagnose some

74
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">rooms here is a case study at Berkeley</font>

75
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:20,700
now what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here is essentially</font>

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,040
Berkeley's overview overall view of what

77
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:29,969
PGP looks like how they see the outside

78
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:33,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">world at the far left is Berkeley campus</font>

79
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:36,510
and the two notes you see right next to

80
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:40,050
the square box at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP peers next to</font>

81
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:43,740
them are the BGP next hops exported by

82
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:48,630
those peers and then the rest is the a

83
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:51,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">s3 the thickness of the edge is</font>

84
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:54,870
proportional to the number of prefixes

85
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,270
that edge carries now what most of this

86
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture is really not surprising what</font>

87
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're expecting berkeley only has one</font>

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,490
provided at that time Karen so all the

89
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,260
prefixes goes through Karen and about

90
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,930
eighty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ghosts request</font>

91
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:13,909
and then you see the usual<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect of</font>

92
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:17,160
tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level 380 and so on and</font>

93
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:21,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Berkeley also have about six percent of</font>

94
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:24,210
the prefixes coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Abilene now but</font>

95
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,880
actually part of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

96
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:31,620
expected even to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Berkeley let me give</font>

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,750
you some context at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top router the</font>

98
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,990
top bgp router the one that says pier

99
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:40,169
with policy is that the path that

100
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:45,720
carries that commodity internet rounds

101
00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:48,150
and they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be GP next hops for low</font>

102
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,360
blow balancing and their rate limiters

103
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:53,880
and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> berkeley</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> op was doing is</font>

104
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">just simply splitting the prefix face in</font>

105
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,159
half and they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that splitting it</font>

106
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:02,370
exactly in half and<font color="#E5E5E5"> low balancing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

107
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">22 next hop but what this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture shows</font>

108
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:08,310
you is no that's not what happening and

109
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,760
most of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going through one of the</font>

110
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,760
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop</font>

111
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:17,919
now this picture maps all the prefixes

112
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,580
the overall view of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> berkeley sees</font>

113
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,909
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> cham can make map any subset of</font>

114
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:28,690
routes and one meaningful subset is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

115
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:31,780
communities now a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp policies</font>

116
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:36,910
are tied to bgp communities for example

117
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:39,969
route preference futuring setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> ralph</font>

118
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:42,070
scope so because so many things are

119
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually relying on bgp communities</font>

120
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:47,229
working it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to see what those</font>

121
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,349
communities really mean do they really

122
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:54,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean what the documentation says it</font>

123
00:06:50,349 --> 00:06:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">means now here is a visualization of a</font>

124
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,820
scenic community that<font color="#E5E5E5"> phoenix earth is</font>

127
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:10,210
percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the of the prefixes do come</font>

128

from Los nettles but more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twice of</font>

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,599
then this community won't be working

134
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,960
correctly for them because they will be

135
00:07:28,599 --> 00:07:34,479
also giving special treatment to<font color="#CCCCCC"> KDDI</font>

138
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:47,139
picture is useful but often it's not

139
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:50,409
sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> because routing is fluent and</font>

140
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:53,590
it changed all the time now<font color="#CCCCCC"> tam can map</font>

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">you reach other routes that it should</font>

145
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,770
map and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the analysis part</font>

146
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,710
comes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> stemming what stemming does is</font>

147
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:11,380
it picks the right set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> events and the</font>

148
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,090
prefixes in them and it can let you

149
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,870
visualize them or you can spit out a

150
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:19,179
one-line diagnosis but this kind of

151
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,880
announces a root cause analysis is a

152
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,370
really hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

153
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:31,260
why because<font color="#CCCCCC"> vgp is extremely</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tatted this</font>

154
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:34,590

155
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:37,319
is number of events and the x axis is

157
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,570
last year now you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of event</font>

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:48,470
about a million events so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font>

160
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,420
that I mean is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it something that um</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">take action</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now let's look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at just some</font>

of the events from one of the event

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:12,420
spike this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very tiny portion of one</font>

167
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,640
of the events bike they're probably and

168
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:17,490
other 30,000 pages that you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

169
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,840
at and after<font color="#CCCCCC"> this page I'm already sick</font>

170
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:24,510
of it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at more</font>

171
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:26,700
events but bgp sent you a million events

172
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,580
not because a million things happen

173
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,160
that's because bgp can only talk at the

174
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,950
prefix level probably a few things

175
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,040
happen appearing laws some bunch of

176
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,710
prefixes got policy change and moved

177
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,740
somewhere else but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way for</font>

178
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:46,040
the protocol to tell you that one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

179
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,620
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen it can only tell you</font>

180
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:56,490
one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing happen in a million</font>

181
00:09:49,620 --> 00:10:00,240
slightly different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> now let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

182
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,520
take a bunch of events from that event

183
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,810
stream and a bunch of withdrawals and

184
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:09,510
look at what they look like now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

185
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:13,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually most of the withdrawals from</font>

186
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:19,680
that event spike has won 14 to three and

187
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:23,730
209 in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS path so 1 143 is karen</font>

188
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:27,150
and 209 is quest and you see the bgp

189
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:31,430
router IP address and the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop but</font>

190
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,430
why do they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this common portion</font>

191
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,850
and that's because somewhere in the

192
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,450
original routing tree a failure happened

193
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:45,480
a branch was cut and this common portion

194
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:48,750
we call a stem thereby stemming analysis

195
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:51,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually tells you where that failure</font>

196
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:55,110
happens the<font color="#E5E5E5"> failure happens at the last</font>

197
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:58,740
edge of the common portion in this case

198
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:03,090
is between Karen and quest<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 14 23 and</font>

199
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">209 now if the cut actually happens one</font>

200
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:09,330
hop down between quest and AT&T then

201
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,780
that common portion will include a TNT

202
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,880
as well and the failure would be the

203
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:22,230
last edge of the common portion the stem

204
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:25,110
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> between quest and AT&T now this</font>

205
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:28,650
concept of finding the common portion is

206
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:32,040
very intuitive but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not a</font>

207
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:35,449
trivial problem finding the stem itself

208
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,880
is actually have some complicating

209
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:40,860
features we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do a simple</font>

210
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,270
correlation let's just correlate all the

211
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,690
events and see what the biggest

212
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:48,240
correlation is because all events would

213
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,280
be correlated at the root everything

214
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,650
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the a s</font>

215
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:57,360
path like in this example everything

216
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:59,939
would be coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from berkeley and one</font>

217
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,570
other thing that is complicating is the

218
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,700
way the internet works probably multiple

219
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:09,630
things always happen at the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

220
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:14,280
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> daniel analysis have to do is</font>

221
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:16,200
to first find all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pick up</font>

222
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:18,569
the different things happening at

223
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,030
different places and and pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> them apart</font>

224
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:24,120
we can't confuse them as one thing

225
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:26,760
happening so in this example if there's

226
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:30,480
a failure between Karen and quest and

227
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,550
thus a failure between Karen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Abilene</font>

228
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,790
then they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be two separate</font>

229
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,790
incidents

230
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:48,449
now actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> correlation</font>

231
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:50,550
analysis is well established and common

232
00:12:48,449 --> 00:12:53,430
field in statistics and they're usually

233
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,439
solved by algorithms<font color="#CCCCCC"> like principal</font>

234
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:57,930
component analysis hierarchical

235
00:12:55,439 --> 00:13:01,379
clustering and so on what these

236
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,508
algorithms do is to rank the

237
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:07,439
correlations from the biggest to the

238
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:12,809
weakest and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not you'll find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

239
00:13:07,439 --> 00:13:15,629
the correlations and but in our context

240
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:17,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the context of BGP using these</font>

241
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:20,430
algorithms is computationally very

242
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:25,019
expensive they're usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the order</font>

243
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:28,979
of n square or with much implementation

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:37,699
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> s it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not the number</font>

249
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:48,508
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good because we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

250
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:50,519
practical operational tool we don't want

251
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:53,189
to wait four hours before knowing what

252
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,189
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are</font>

253
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:59,759
certain BGP path structures that we can

254
00:13:56,189 --> 00:14:02,339
exploit in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm so what we did</font>

255
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,980
is develop the linear time algorithm

256
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:09,120
costs stemming that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploits such power</font>

257
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:14,699
structures and this algorithm runs real

258
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:18,300
time on a modern processor now so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

259
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:20,639
have used examples from Berkeley which

260
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,649
which has a pretty simple topology a

261
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,050
tree<font color="#E5E5E5"> like topology they only have one</font>

262
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:28,009
provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> Karen and it splits out from</font>

263
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:31,679
there and you only have<font color="#E5E5E5"> like four</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

264
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:34,410
speaking routers but this algorithm also

265
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:36,809
works on more complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> forest like</font>

266
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:40,339
topologies like the ones you'll find at

267
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:43,860
tier ones which can have hundreds of BGP

268
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:44,450
routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP peers thousands of BGP next</font>

269
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,180
hops

270
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:56,089
peering with most of the often<font color="#E5E5E5"> other t</font>

271
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:56,089
ones and then hundreds of customers so

272
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:01,589
how well does the stemming analysis work

273
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:03,930
I mean what kind of stuff does it fine

274
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:07,100
I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what what what can it show</font>

275
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:10,199
you now let's look at this case study

276
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:14,750
what we will show what happened in this

277
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:18,360
that one<font color="#E5E5E5"> event spike now what we are</font>

278
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:21,020
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show here is not part of the</font>

279
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,020
analysis

280
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:33,959
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're showing here is we have</font>

281
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:36,360
stemming the analysis technique pick out

282
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:39,089
what happened in that event spike and

283
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,579
pick up the subset of events responsible

284
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:43,889
for that incident and we feed that

285
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:47,248
subset of events to tamp the

286
00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:50,399
visualization technique and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> visualize</font>

287
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:53,819
what happened so visualization is not

288
00:15:50,399 --> 00:16:01,920
part of the analysis so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me explain</font>

289
00:15:53,819 --> 00:16:04,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">this picture a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

290
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,860
top half of the graph is similar to what

00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">bottom we have a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of new legends</font>

294
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,759

chart for a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess edge in</font>

296
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:27,179
this case if between Karen and quest and

297
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:29,369
on the left is a time a clock that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the seconds minutes and seconds</font>

299
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:38,839
into the event stream and another<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

300
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:42,239
the if an edge is blue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means is</font>

301
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:45,809
losing prefixes on the edge if the edge

302
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,749
screen it means is gaining prefixes if

303
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:52,769
it's black that means it's not changing

304
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:56,910
so let's play this visualization and see

305
00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:59,129
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening so what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is essentially</font>

306
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,100
happening which you can also see in the

307
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:05,069
time series chart is between Karen and

308
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:08,519
quests they lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 30,000 prefixes</font>

309
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:11,418
now what is really surprising to us and

310
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:16,919
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Berkeley is when that happens</font>

311
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:21,899
let's move back time little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

312
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:24,480

<font color="#CCCCCC">stopped along saying all those dirty</font>

her keep you know pick up the backup

320
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:43,370
pass right away so essentially what

321
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,679
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is all of the traffic went</font>

322

through the lower more expensive not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ray</font>

323
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:53,120

communities because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berkeley heavily</font>

325

326
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,610
is when the Pharaoh for helping Karen

327
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:04,400
doesn't it didn't tag the right

336
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:32,480
the power of the analysis of stemming is

337
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:40,908
it picked out the one hop original path

338

and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 67 hop on failure path and the</font>

as we see the faith<font color="#CCCCCC"> / happening the</font>

342
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:03,029
visualization actually shows you the

00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:07,950

349
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,780
so

350
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:40,060
yeah picking out a hearing loss like

351
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,520
this is nice but well can it can it find

352
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,879
out the stuff can the analysis find

353
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,910
other non<font color="#E5E5E5"> spiky incidents a lot of</font>

355
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:55,930
the result in distinctive event spikes

356
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:59,310
like oscillations so can stemming the

357
00:19:55,930 --> 00:20:03,310
analysis help here yes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> does help</font>

358
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:06,700
stemming is not just about finding and

359
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,500
explaining events like now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

360
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">because one of the most important</font>

361
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,840
property of stemming is temporal

362
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:16,210
independence it does not depend on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">sequence of the events it doesn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> depend</font>

365
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,550
doesn't have time in it and it works

366
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">like that because the concept of</font>

367
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:30,510
correlation is well defined at any time

368
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,190
scale so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you have</font>

369
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:37,120
appearing laws the time scale would be

370
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:39,940
in the order of convergence a small time

371
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,179
scale and the biggest correlation would

372
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,790
come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the massive prefix</font>

373
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:48,610
announcement and withdrawals but if you

374
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:52,450
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a longer time scale like days or</font>

375
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:55,870
hours days or weeks and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a route</font>

376
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,220
oscillation happening that the biggest

377
00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,550
correlation would come<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

378
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,830
continuous oscillation because that

379
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:10,210
biggest correlation would overwhelm the

380
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:14,889
other correlation so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

381
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:18,820
case study this is a BGP event rate

385
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,940

392
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:50,080
happening so what the problem is a

393
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,289
persistent route flap about once a

394
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,559
minute and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> involves a customer and it</font>

395
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:59,820
lasted about a month and a half and this

396
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,820
is what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like</font>

397
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:14,450
so let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain the set up a little</font>

398
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:17,389
bit it's a relatively common<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up the</font>

399
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:22,190
customer has a direct peering with the

00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">tier 1 and it also have a connection</font>

free hop in direct paths through the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nab</font>

through<font color="#CCCCCC"> allottee ones through this t1</font>

405
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:43,520
now what is happening is this direct

406
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:46,190
path between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer and the this</font>

407
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,320
t1<font color="#E5E5E5"> is flapping and it flaps of our know</font>

408
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:52,370
every minute going up and down and<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

409
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,200
and down and when it goes down all the

410
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:56,389
other pops in that t1 said well you know

411
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have alternate path that goes</font>

412
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:00,920
throughout the t1 and the snap so they

413
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:05,510
start announcing these alternate paths

414
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:08,000
and when the customer paths come back up

415
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,730
like right now well it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

416
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,370
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pops other pops will withdraw</font>

417
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:18,730
their alternate paths and this went on

418
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:25,719
about a month and a half now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

419
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:25,720
also go<font color="#CCCCCC"> for one other thing here</font>

420
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:38,010
when the other pops are announcing the

421
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:40,470
three hot paths you see a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

422
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">apps now coming up but then some are</font>

423
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:47,330
made one at t1 and I'm broken and move

424
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,890
to another tier 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is a</font>

this you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the visualization tool</font>

427
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,459
to validate whether your preference is

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,470
working the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're working is it</font>

429
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:05,159
really going to one place that I think

430
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:11,059
it should be going to or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so at</font>

431
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:15,059
the one to show you another oscillation

432
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:17,220
at the last nanog Danny Macpherson talk

433
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:20,280
about men oscillation and how bad they

434
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,470
are and we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want them and stemming</font>

435
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:25,110
helps you find such oscillation and

436
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:30,679
here's one that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened at a Tier one</font>

437
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:34,289
isp in the US oh just play it for you

438
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:38,220
what is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> is let me explain this</font>

439
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:40,980
graph the bottom two routers call to a

440
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> B they belong in the same pop and</font>

441
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top to Cole one a and B they put</font>

442
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:50,640
believe belonging to another pop the

443
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:53,520
bottom two pgp peers somehow went crazy

444
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,679
and they were announcing and withdrawing

445
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,840
the same exact<font color="#E5E5E5"> route every 10</font>

446
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,880
microseconds and that's every time

447
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,340
microseconds you don't think bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

448
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,230
speak so fast but it was it was doing

449
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,539
this so that's why it's yellow because

450
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,669
we don't want to show blue and blue and

451
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:12,150
green juice you know flapping like every

452
00:25:08,669 --> 00:25:14,190
10 microseconds and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually drives</font>

453
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:18,330
the classical meant oscillation set up

454
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:21,000
this described by<font color="#CCCCCC"> RC 3345 and drives the</font>

455
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:23,928
upper two routers in the same pop just

456
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">going up and down</font>

457
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:36,870
so this only involves one prefix but

458
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:39,630
when it was happening it accounted for

459
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,479
ninety five percent of the total<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

460
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:46,820
events that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it inflated the</font>

461
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP traffic by a factor of twenty</font>

462
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:04,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we show a couple of realizations</font>

463
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:08,970
of obstetric results from stemming and

464
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:12,720
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it works accurately but</font>

465
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:17,299
the main point of the techniques is not

466
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,650
really in the visualization finding the

467
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:22,620
incident<font color="#CCCCCC"> the failure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that happen is a</font>

468
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,390
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more valuable than visualizing it so</font>

469
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:29,340
if that's one point to take away from

470
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:31,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk is the analysis technique can</font>

471
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:34,918
crunch down a million events and spit

472
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,890
out a one line to line diagnosis in this

473
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:39,990
case so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the output of stemming</font>

474
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:43,370
the one line diagnosis I've been telling

475
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:49,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">you about so throughout the talk so at</font>

476
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:51,659
certain time this bgp router lost 28 293

477
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,500
prefixes and the peering fell from

478
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:58,200
caroline quest to this long backup path

479
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:01,130
about 20 minutes later it gained back

480
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:04,410
those 30,000 prefixes this pre ring a

481
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:07,620
caring quest through Karen and quest

482
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:13,110
peering restore so that's the kind of

483
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:15,689
the main point of the analysis okay last

484
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,939
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not least i want to thank u</font>

485
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,280
c---berkeley net up and especially can

486
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">lindahl for allowing us to collect the</font>

487

data and showing them here and also the

488
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:29,360
anonymous t1 is p for allowing us to

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> frequency analysis of those</font>

491
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:41,860
routing events to actually find out you

492
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,180
know hi oscillations and the long

493
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:47,000
oscillation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how like you</font>

494
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:50,060
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korea analysis or something so you</font>

495
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">would get you know break down to high</font>

496
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:56,149
oscillation yeah congratulations kind of

497
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,340
you know by algorithm right yeah we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

498
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:00,740
have thought about that so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

499
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:03,679
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know basically the crazy mad</font>

500
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,440
oscillation first because<font color="#E5E5E5"> is flapping so</font>

501
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:08,630
frequently components you know if you

502
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,060
see the whole time<font color="#E5E5E5"> series which is you</font>

503
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,790
know sometimes difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to grasp</font>

504
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:16,220
particular you know components of it

505
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:18,320
especially if it is low intensity high

506
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,450
frequency but it could be important you

507
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:27,879
know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network health it was your</font>

508
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:27,880
thinking thank you
