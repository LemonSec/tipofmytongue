00:00:00,949 --> 00:00:06,420
I'm talking to you today from a human

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,489
factors perspective so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,500
counts along with Diane as being the

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,889
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> person in the room here who's not</font>

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,590
technical human factors perspective

6
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:19,109
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I care about what people like</font>

7
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:22,410
you do when you're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> with complex</font>

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,600
technologies I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> design tools to</font>

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:27,539
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do the work that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,779
and to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> those tools are really</font>

11
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,450
useful for the ways you value doing your

12
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,660
work so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk to you today</font>

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,059
about a project that I'm working on and

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,910
we're in the initial stages I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">with lucent technologies and it's aimed</font>

16
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,589
at all kinds of networks I think that's

17
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,090
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to say seeing as we've</font>

18
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,120
heard so much about the difference

19
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:54,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">between internet and telecommunications</font>

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,280
our goal is to support advanced

21
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,890
troubleshooting especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,590
end-to-end performance in hybrid

23
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,619
networks much more usefully than people

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,530
can do it right now we've conceptualized

25
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,510
giving advanced<font color="#CCCCCC"> troubleshooters</font>

26
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:12,930
workspaces for integrating the really

27
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:16,170
hard parts of problem solving and we've

28
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,630
conceptualized a standalone open source

29
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,439
framework which serves as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a workspace</font>

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,000
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a little bit later</font>

31
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,949
right now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first stage of</font>

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,229
this we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not at the framework stage</font>

33
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:31,380
and the first stage for that especially

34
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,840
from a human factors point of view is to

35
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,960
discover what<font color="#CCCCCC"> troubleshooters actually</font>

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,329
do when they tackle complex problems and

37
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,089
what support they need that might mean

38
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:45,449
many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and you are of supreme</font>

39
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,890
interest to us and our project we know

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,470
that there are a lot of end-to-end

41
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:52,590
initiatives going on right now to help

42
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,630
in complex troubleshooting and things

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,369
that are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> into how to gather</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

44
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,408
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are needed how to create</font>

45
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,000
databases how to have these additional

46
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,869
metrics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're hearing about right</font>

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,439
now how do you have good tools what

48
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,690
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at is beyond that how do</font>

49
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:10,500
people put all that together to do work

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,530
that

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:16,500
really have any structure that's a

52
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,990
preset predefined rule driven structure

53
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,000
and to gather that information we're

54
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,220
doing observations we're talking to

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,570
people and having interviews and we're

56
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,720
analyzing transcripts of troubleshooting

57
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,190
conversations whether through email or

58
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,570
some other trouble tickets and all those

59
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:40,220
kinds of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

60
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:42,780
look at what is a complex problem

61
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:45,930
complex problem is anything that's

62
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,380
unfamiliar and unanticipated it doesn't

63
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,110
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> formula equate it it's things</font>

64
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,269
like intermittent faults or something's

happening that shouldn't be or entangled

66
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,620
faults that require<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end</font>

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to many of you that represents a complex</font>

together they looked at the path one of

appropriate test points to represent the

out from the conference sites which was

the Giga pop to the remote participants

91
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:00,150
at the universities the engineers split

92
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,548
the path and found loss from the

93
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,410
backbone to the Giga pop they then

94
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:08,660
studied the Giga pop end of the path

95

closely they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the router</font>

there wasn't any means for doing so nor

time through<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took all day to track</font>

and there was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of trouble with</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">communication across the segments and</font>

133
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,870
and we've gathered many cases that show

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,239
even more complex problems than this one

135
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:46,940
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar but instead of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a known</font>

136
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,580
problem it was an unknown problem so

137
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:51,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">that an ATM switch was out and nobody</font>

138
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,210
had any idea of what was wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font>

139
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,880
had done it you could fix that problem

140
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,979
but the root cause analysis then took

141
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,190
many many hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> to track down what the</font>

real problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> was you can even we even</font>

143
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:06,560
have more complex examples such as one

144
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,349
in which<font color="#CCCCCC"> a calls and a voice over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

we're completing but parties weren't

146
00:06:09,349 --> 00:06:13,849
hearing each other and this happened

147
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">only one every 1000 calls and it</font>

148
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:20,719
happened over many many weeks all parts

150
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,650
engineer<font color="#E5E5E5"> who was in charge of it decided</font>

151
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,110
that he would bring in some ad hoc data

152
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,388
from the billing records to see which

153
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,979
calls he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> short hold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times figuring</font>

154
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,590
that he could find out where the problem

155
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:35,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that way so he wanted to correlate</font>

156
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,280
those with data on each part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

157
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,040
system from the phone adapters the

158
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,130
router ports the ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> P sub nests but</font>

159
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was complicated by unique IDs</font>

160
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,290
changing as the calls traverse the

161
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,030
system what was hard for this analyst

162
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:51,890
this network engineer was to see

163
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:54,950
patterns because of the huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

164
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:56,659
calls and the changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> identifiers so</font>

165
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,120
even after when all the data are

166
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,740
available there's this huge problem of

167
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,200
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put it together how to see</font>

168
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,270
non-obvious patterns and how to display

169
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,820
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> for certain types of problems and</font>

170
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:09,530
certain types of analysis so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people</font>

171
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,469
can really understand what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

172
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:15,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">know this is what we're really looking</font>

173
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:17,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">at not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what data are needed not</font>

174
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,130
just what<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge bases are needed not</font>

175
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:21,560
just how to integrate data across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

176
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,800
system but how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mix that with the</font>

177
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,600
human intelligence that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> required for</font>

178
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,280
non-standard problems and augment that

179
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,040
intelligence with the tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

180
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and not try to automatically replace it</font>

181
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,380
because you can't in complex problem

182
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:39,169
solving so what's our focus for support

183
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,390
we want to try to see what people's

184
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:43,729
integrated experiences are and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,280
integrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> support for that we've</font>

186
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,530
roughed out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> standalone framework that</font>

187
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,330
needs to be filled in once we find out

188
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,059
what people's real needs and practices

189
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:56,240
and activities are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about</font>

190
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,130
bringing data in and helping to parse it

191
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,500
and sync it up so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can analyze</font>

192
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:03,140
data from across diverse sources that's

193
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,870
often lien compatibly formatted from

194
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:07,940
there it would feed into a database and

195
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:10,729
this would feed into a visualization

196
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,080
engine which would then know the kinds

197
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of data that need to be looked at</font>

198
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,099
together the best graphs for doing that

199
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">and display those so that people can see</font>

00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-obvious patterns there would be a</font>

00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,169
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're on the first</font>

205
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:31,909
step which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the user modeling and</font>

206
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:35,449
that's really trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get just the</font>

207
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:37,789
right level of analysis I've talked

208
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,159
about designers know how to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

209
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,890
the low level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of analysis the tests that</font>

210
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be run and doing segment by</font>

212
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,130
pretty high

213
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:51,800
analysis which is the kind of aggregates

214
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are needed large level displays</font>

215

that are needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> or best practices</font>

216
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,010
databases but what we're looking at is

217
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,020
the hardest to define which is that

218
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:01,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">mid-level where we're trying to see what</font>

219
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,970
are people's integrated moves as they're

220
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,829
moving through complex problems to get

221
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,960
them from here to there and what do they

222
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">need in terms of a kind of mixed</font>

223
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:13,340
initiative between machines and humans

224
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,100
to really augment human intelligence

225
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,620
that kind of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> would address these</font>

226
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,800
reality checks help with decision about

227
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,290
trade-offs getting accessible data

228
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,430
getting available data and recognizing

229
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:31,550
non-obvious patterns our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step is to</font>

230
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:34,400
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to learn from support engineers</font>

231
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:37,010
what some of these mid-level challenges

232
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:39,560
are in problem solving and then turn our

233
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,900
models<font color="#E5E5E5"> into an open source framework and</font>

234
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,849
workspace they can serve as a

235
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:46,730
problem-solving workspace for these

236
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:51,830
complex troubleshooting events we're

237
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:54,230
also looking at artifacts like email

238
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:56,060
exchanges and trouble tickets and seeing

239
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,490
what we can find from that in terms of

240
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,989
the ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem solving goes on</font>

241
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,730
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the most important things</font>

242
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found from the ones that we've</font>

243
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:05,900
looked at so far by stretching them out

244
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,000
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think you can read that but</font>

245
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:09,890
what you see up there is stretching out

246
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
some of these conversations of where

247
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">people look what they needed what they</font>

248
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,400
needed to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem solving better</font>

249
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,230
and at the very front what we see are

250
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:21,230
linearly those are prerequisites

251
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,520
anything that is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left needs to be</font>

252
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,730
in place before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do the</font>

253
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:28,189
problem-solving steps to the right and

254
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,560
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> purple group those things are</font>

255
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,200
all things that are highly political

256
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,150
getting application developers to

257
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,520
develop in certain ways getting people

258
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,350
to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> information getting people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

259
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:42,050
feel responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing certain</font>

260
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:45,110
algorithms and so we found that this

261
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of political nature is one of the</font>

262
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">most important things to get in place</font>

263
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:50,630
and we've also found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very</font>

264
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:53,480
difficult thing to do and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

265
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:55,250
in a decentralised distributed world so

266
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,070
as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said we're trying to lead this to a</font>

267
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,900
framework and any comments or help or

268
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:03,200
stories<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can share</font>

269
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,990
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> really appreciate it oh there's a</font>

270
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">bath afterwards</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where it's at nine</font>

271
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,590
o'clock tonight where I'll be there and

272
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,680
would love to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people about some</font>

273
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:16,370
of their stories no I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

274
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,459
anything in the next okay if if you want

275
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,350
to get a hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> of her arm why don't you</font>

276
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:23,480
send to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nano glist your email</font>

277
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,340
address she'll sent send to the list and

278
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,830
then ugh and she'll give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

279
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,140
dress she'd really appreciate stories it

280
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,890
really would help them look at

281
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,890
troubleshooting in the way it occurs
