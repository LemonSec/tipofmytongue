8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:22,670
probably one person or a small number of

persons with a botnet attacking scope

10
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:27,720
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm from kada we do a lot of network</font>

call the network telescope a lot of you

may know by another other names like a

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,000
anomalous in some way it's someone

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,320
all that kind of stuff it's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

32
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,290
seeing big events because it samples

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,449
about one out of every 256 ipv4

34
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:23,159
addresses but it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell us</font>

35
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,479
about you know one little thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

happening in one place it's good for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> big explosion kind of events and</font>

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,420
it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there for us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

39
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,130
something with the network telescope it

depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there being some kind of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">random component in the thing that we</font>

42
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,669
see so it's someone just off the top of

43
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,950
their head deciding on a subnet to scan

44
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,649
or it's a worm<font color="#CCCCCC"> that spreads by scanning</font>

addresses by picking them orinda so

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,860
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of things that we can</font>

49
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,869
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> um so this is how we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

50
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,570
able to monitor to now good now serves

51
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,189
attacks that we see a little red things

52
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,710
you see coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> in come from the attacker</font>

53
00:01:59,189 --> 00:02:04,350
and the attacker is often way more than

54
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,360
one machine but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TAC packets come</font>

55
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,699
into the victim they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> spoof source</font>

56
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,649
IP addresses<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

57
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:11,209
can't really tell them from any

58
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:12,650
legitimate addresses or<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate</font>

59
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:14,390
traffic that's going on so the victim

60
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,280
responds to all of these addresses and

61
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,809
sends random traffic out onto the

62
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,030
network time people who do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not solicit</font>

63
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,980
it so we get a big chunk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that into</font>

64
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:26,150
our network telescope big monitor

65
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,890
addresses circle you see up there so who

66
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,440
is scope for those who have been under a

67
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,750
rock to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last year so they were</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">originally Santa Cruz operations a unix</font>

69
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,530
server company and they were bought by

70
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,140
caldera and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then they changed their name</font>

71
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,519
back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> schoo group and got some IP from</font>

72
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,440
novell so they have this chunk they have

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,910
some parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux source code that's</font>

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they own the rights to so last</font>

76
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:52,700
year they sued IBM and they've

77
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,739
threatened to sue a lot of other people

78
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,810
including<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux users and</font>

79
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:01,340
this has made them pretty unpopular um

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,569
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> there o people set of kind of</font>

Microsoft these days in the open source

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:10,280
community which is quite an

84
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:12,018
accomplishment so in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little history on</font>

85
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,340
their denial of service attacks because

86
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:17,900
they aren't real popular they've been

87
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:20,389
attacked a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times um may of</font>

88
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,739
2003 they were attacked in August they

89
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:23,690
were attacked again and there were some

90
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:25,459
rumors at that time that they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

91
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,910
faking the attack to cover up some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

92
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:31,400
of internal network problem but don't

93
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,530
really know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if that's true or not so</font>

94
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,350
then in December on December 10th they

95
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:39,769
were the target of that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's</font>

96
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:43,608
a 340 megabit per second syn flood that

97
00:03:39,769 --> 00:03:45,560
incapacitated their web server so they

98
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:46,940
were being attacked they you know issued

99
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,799
a press release saying hey we're being

100
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">attacked and then later</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the day a</font>

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,680
blog called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wroclaw posted a report that</font>

102
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:56,268
scho was not in fact being attacked they

103
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,459
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> just making this all up in order to</font>

104
00:03:56,269 --> 00:04:01,700
implicate the open source community and

105
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:02,989
there was nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> really going on the</font>

106
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,388
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning we got a call from a</font>

107
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:07,430
reporter asking us you know was this

108
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:09,769
true wisco really being attacked because

109
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,819
there were a lot of nurse new stories

110
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:11,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">being saying they were being attacked</font>

111
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:13,730
there were a bunch of news stories

112
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,480
saying no they're just making that up

113
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,918
there see how evil they are

114
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,839
and so we went and looked at our<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

115
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:21,448
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> found hey they are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually being</font>

116
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,340
attacked after all that same day<font color="#E5E5E5"> the syn</font>

117
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:25,020
flood was expanded to also target their

118
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,210
ftp server in addition to their web

119
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:29,130
server and we think that might be partly

120
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,620
because in a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> comments on the</font>

121
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,270
blog people were using as evidence of

122
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the web server not being down the fact</font>

123
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,469
that they could still get to the ftp

124
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:41,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">server</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't quite understand how that</font>

125
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:43,320
works but whatever so then that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Saint</font>

126
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,270
later on on the 11th go took themselves

127
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,500
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net because they'd been working</font>

128
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,060
for two days trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get their</font>

00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,949
providers to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help them filter traffic</font>

130
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,810
coming in and it wasn't working<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there</font>

131
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:55,800
was no point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> just continuing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sink</font>

132
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:58,260
all this traffic that was coming in so

133
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,460
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our little graph of the denial</font>

coming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco you'll see the attack</font>

136
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,369
starting and then with a big red line

137
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,810
going up and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see kind of</font>

138
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,820
damp down some as they stopped

139
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,320
responding to a lot of traffic and tried

140
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,030
to do their own internal filtering

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,830
operations that didn't work very well at

142
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,289
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can see the next day</font>

143
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:17,880
the ftp attack starts and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

144
00:05:16,289 --> 00:05:22,560
completely saturated they have a ds3

packets per second they can handle<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

147
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:31,590
out and that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> max of what</font>

148
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:33,450
they could take so nothing's got kind of

149
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,919
interesting at least for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we published</font>

150
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,210
our little<font color="#E5E5E5"> write-up saying yes they were</font>

151
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,530
attacked here's the graph that shows

152
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,359
they were attacked you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

153
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:40,830
observing this anyone who has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

154
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,389
chunk of address space anywhere could

155
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,609
also observe this if they look for it

156
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,770
and we got to be the source of a lot of

157
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack of a lot of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source</font>

158
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,760
folks we learned some interesting things

159
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,039
like that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work was funded by</font>

160
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,990
scope and that we didn't exist and that

161
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,430
we hadn't existed before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 / 10</font>

162
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:58,200
which was kind of interesting because

163
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">both of these things are pretty easy to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sources are our funding on our website</font>

167
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:08,250
and Google will tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">around for a long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

169
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,910
I'm nuts not really interesting to

00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,440
anyone more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us except that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the closest thing there is to an</font>

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,760
open source community pioneer in the

173
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,590
network community you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have data</font>

174
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,849
and we try to release it to people we

175
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,229
make open source tools and

176
00:06:20,849 --> 00:06:23,460
visualizations and try to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> them out</font>

177
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:24,020
to people and make them freely available

178
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,219
to

179
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,900
people and try to get people to

180
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,690
cooperate so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of interesting</font>

181
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,919
that they would choose us as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> target</font>

182
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:32,509
and then we got our own boss attack

183
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,000
later on that evening about eleven

184
00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:36,590
o'clock at night and some of the attack

185
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,289
characteristics of the attack against us

186
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,628
a point to maybe the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same tools or the</font>

187
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:43,849
same perpetrator as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> schoo attack but</font>

188
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,680
there's no real evidence one way or

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:49,639
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can say for sure what</font>

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened so we learned a lot of things</font>

careful what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we say to reporters and</font>

reporters and people saying well<font color="#CCCCCC"> schoo</font>

198
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,440
says they're being completely

199
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,929
incapacitated by the syn flood you know

200
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,210
is that bad is that real and we would

201
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,949
say well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flood shouldn't be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

202
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,180
bad it means in cookies and a lot of

00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:25,310
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what's going</font>

208

on and yeah technology does exist to

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,300
thwart syn floods but not at 340

211

00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,860
else can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used for bandwidth attacks</font>

214
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,180
and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that also we</font>

215

the inbound traffic there is PS won't

admit that they give them connectivity

223
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,310
so they sure weren't about to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

224
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:57,409
corroborate the fact that they were

under<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack their CEO was quoting</font>

226

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any five-year-old could be stopping</font>

this attack and wanting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know why they</font>

229
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:06,948
hadn't fixed it yet and their only hope

230
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,568
was upstream ISPs helping them out who

231
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:10,159
they weren't do a direct customer of and

232
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:12,650
they're not real popular with ngoc

233
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:14,360
employees and it said they'd call up and

234
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,979
say you know can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys please help us</font>

235
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,360
out can you put in some filters you know

236
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:19,310
help us block this traffic that's coming

237
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us from your ingress points where</font>

238
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:23,090
it's you're getting most of it and then

239
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:25,009
yeah the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would say yeah sure</font>

240
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,359
we'll get right on that and you know

241
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:30,169
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost hear the sounds of quake</font>

242
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,269
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background so it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

243
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">fun to be there</font>

244
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,419
but there's a lot that we admit everyone

245
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:36,769
in the community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing</font>

246

community and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISPs have to learn from</font>

247
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:41,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">this as well um there's also some things</font>

248
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,639
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ponder about for the open</font>

249
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,110
source community which is why did anyone

250
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,490
believe that scho was faking the attack

251
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,949
to begin with I mean that's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

252
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,540
ludicrous everyone hates them<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

253
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:52,490
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real big stretch to think that</font>

254
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:53,839
someone might attack them and it's a

255
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,490
bigger stretch to believe that they

256
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually paid someone to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attack them</font>

257
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:59,899
because there's no point also it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

258
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,550
really in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best interest of the open</font>

259
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,649
source community to say thats go faked

260
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,910
the attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it was true even if</font>

261
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:07,250
there was some evidence that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was true</font>

262
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:09,170
because it just makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forks</font>

263
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:11,149

00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:13,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of paranoid and on the edge and um</font>

not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to be productive which</font>

266
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:19,519
is the opposite of what's actually going

on and so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a message for us is</font>

that while<font color="#E5E5E5"> many dos attacks are</font>
