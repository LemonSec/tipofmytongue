9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,629
working together and here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'll go</font>

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:37,170
through and beginning with the numbers

11
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:42,420
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> status as of 31 december</font>

12
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:46,920
2003 of the ipv4 address space in / aids

13
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,250
and the figure the bar at the bottom

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,980
central registry that reflects

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:56,399
allocations made not from an irr so

16
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,349
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ddm Nick you're</font>

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,059
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet you're talking</font>

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">about even pre those days things that</font>

19
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,280
jon postel did so that's what that is

20
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:10,439
but as you can see there's still

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,030
approximately most 89 in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna</font>

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,810
allocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you're still ipv4 space</font>

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:22,229
around this is the comparison early from

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:27,060
1999 to the end of 2003 the allocations

26
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:30,000
of the IRS<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> isp S&L IRS and you</font>

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:33,840
can see where the larger activity now is

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,939
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> asia-pacific region and from a</font>

29
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,700
cumulative total this is what it looks

30
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,679
like so<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly each of the IRS has</font>

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">allocated about thirty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the</font>

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,500
address space to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ISPs and lack Nick</font>

33
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,779
being the smallest and newest is at two

34
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,619
percent

35
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:54,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">AS number assignments Aaron continues to</font>

36
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:59,210
allocate more<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS blocks than anybody</font>

37
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:04,380
else and<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a cumulative standpoint</font>

38
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:08,880
you can see it's over fifty percent ipv6

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:13,019
allocations you will note that ripe NCC

40
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:18,180
is really allocated more address space

41
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:20,580
ipv6 / 30 to 35 s anyone else the other

42
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,800
thing the interesting note is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact</font>

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:27,230
that Aaron is now allocating more ipv6

44
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,459
based and the asia-pacific region<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and</font>

45
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:31,980
looking at it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a cumulative total</font>

46
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:35,610
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that over fifty percent of</font>

47
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,429
it is allocated in the European area and

48
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:43,050
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it by economies you can</font>

49
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,900
see the top five US Japan Germany the

50
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:49,650
Netherlands in the UK and then there's

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,900
259 other economies where they have

52
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,350
basically received one or two type

53
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,170
allocations maybe three or four the

54
00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:03,000
other thing it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not showing on here is</font>

55
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:06,059
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripe NCC has allocated recently a</font>

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,630
couple of large allocations want to / 31

57
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:12,150
and the other one as a / 27 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

58
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,840

you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at stats go</font>

61
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,700
to these lengths you can go to the ASO

very very

<font color="#E5E5E5">we discussed a bit and</font>

286
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,260
have kind of divergent opinions on

287
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,239
hadn't heard a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> by community yet</font>

288
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:36,900
partly because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think that had</font>

289
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,610
been solicited i'm curious whether we

290
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:42,150
can ask whether other people have

291
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,830
opinions on what the fees for my car

292
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:49,680
location should be or whether that's

293
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:55,200
inappropriate well I you remember the

294
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:57,779
boards yes if anybody does have a

295
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,930
comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's feel free to speak</font>

296
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:04,700
up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this matter will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be taken up</font>

297
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">by the board at their next meeting and</font>

298
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,680
will be discussed and presented at the

299
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,329
members<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Vancouver so as a</font>

300
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,489
board member I'm really curious what

301
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:17,100
people think the right price for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it my</font>

302
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:21,450
provocation membership should be frankly

303
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,640
current prices for annual membership

304
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:26,380
we've had the minimums the current

305
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:30,620
maneuver ties is

306
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:32,790
yes and so there needs to be some lower

307
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,700
price for the news

308
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,469
let's say so<font color="#E5E5E5"> correct minimum is 20 or 19</font>

309
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,080
ending on whether you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll be home</font>

310
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:43,350
and this is down to this

311
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,560
i Ken<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew you sorry current friended</font>

312
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,850
current minimum is 20 or 19 depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

313
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,250
whether you're welding on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> mrs.</font>

314
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">future because it's a slash twenty and</font>

315
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a this is a minimum allocation size</font>

316
00:14:52,580 --> 00:15:02,490
right so the new micro occasion is down

317
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:05,640
to bits from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right yes okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 22</font>

318
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:10,050
so if you were to receive the 22 and

319
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:13,069
thousands of 24 addresses you know what

320
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:16,400
would the right price<font color="#CCCCCC"> for an annular</font>

321
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,400
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed</font>

322
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:21,279
others

323
00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:24,989
thank you
