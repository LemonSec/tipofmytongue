1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what does netcom not going to</font>

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,770
give you a full update of it because

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,740
well we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> that once already here</font>

4
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:13,139
no point repeating but the the basic

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,639
view of it is is what you what we hope

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,789
we you would use to<font color="#CCCCCC"> configure your</font>

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,660
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just turn things</font>

8
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,240
around during this discussion

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,220
periodically and and let you guys be the

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,810
voice of nanog and the voice of the

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">operator and ask a couple of questions</font>

12
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,709
as we move forward but we think that

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,340
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a really important</font>

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,829
component to get to help normalize a lot

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,629
of scripts to help make them a lot less

16
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:41,460
fragile as we move forward so over the

17
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,300
last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months net cough has gotten a</font>

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,190
haircut a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the protocol that that</font>

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,930
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there is has been redone we're</font>

20
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have new drafts out and within</font>

21
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,670
the month but we're getting rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a lot</font>

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,109
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overhead that was in the original</font>

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,120
protocol initially we looked at you know

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:02,520
my ideas came out of the beep work that

25
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,339
was that was being done and looking at

26
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,970
providing multiple channels of

27
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:09,900
communication for both events and

28
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,840
configuration and tying those together

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:15,180
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to tear that out actually at</font>

30
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,770
least out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the base net comp trap the</font>

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,420
way things are organized it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much</font>

32
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,339
stacked like you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> netcom if you have</font>

33
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that transports it and then</font>

34
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:25,650
below<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have tcp/ip so we pulled</font>

35
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,170
out as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said we pulled out</font>

36
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:32,400
notifications we've reduced the number

37
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:35,310
of capabilities dramatically and we've

38
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,110
also attempted to make sure that there

39
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,780
was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> such thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a net comp and</font>

40
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">netcom flight netcom will be netcom</font>

41
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,829
flight this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much trying to boil</font>

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,509
things down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the simple ways that</font>

43
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:50,130
things used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done in tcp/ip</font>

44
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:52,049
sometimes still are also boiling this

45
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,449
down it meant one connection one use so

46
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know if you're going to do events or</font>

47
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,320
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do notifications keep on</font>

48
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,570
using syslog until there's something

49
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,789
better if you want to use RC 3195 you do

50
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a separate court on a server</font>

51
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,260
communication line

52
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,419
so my first question as we move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

53
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,480
we have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of questions that the</font>

54
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:15,899
working group would like to ask you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font>

55
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:19,350
and the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is this do you</font>

56
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:22,410
guys find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have devices that sit</font>

57
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,440
behind Nats or behind a firewall or bhai

58
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:28,799
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp assigned address that</font>

59
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:33,660
you want to configure so n customers

60
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,220
that use pppoe or other things where you

61
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,470
want to configure the device where the

62
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,720
we're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IP address would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

63
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:41,190
very bad key or where you don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

64
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to send a sin where the other</font>

65
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,900

66
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:50,370
couple of people one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the this is the</font>

67
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:54,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">Paul Francis friendly question because</font>

68
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,250
we're thinking about gnats in IETF so

69
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,600
this is also the classic case of managed

70
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,090
offerings if you're actually going to

71
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,579
offer the service<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does sit behind a</font>

72
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:04,470

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,690
other guy doesn't really know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

75
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:08,670
configure it doesn't want to configure

76
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:13,130
it and actually wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have high level</font>

77
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:20,369
services here's a chance to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to speak up</font>

78
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:21,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so let me suggest that we this is an</font>

79
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,100
interesting question of itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we</font>

80
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,080
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one that's come up on the</font>

81
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:28,049
list that i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask instead which</font>

82
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,030
is as a matter of security we're looking

83
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,890
at two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different mechanisms to</font>

84
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:35,640
communicate in one is ssh and the other

85
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:37,290
is beep in the case of ssh there's a

86
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,200
debate that's raging on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list as to</font>

87
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:44,670
whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to used the same port</font>

88
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:47,250
that ssh access is used for now that

89
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,929
poses<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little problem for me or at</font>

90
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,950
least it did conceptually because that

91
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,720
would mean that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you wanted to</font>

92
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,510
implement this thing you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

93
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,709
modify each and every access list that

94
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:58,100
you use to control access to your

95
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">devices so my first question to you is</font>

96
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,109
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody care do you care it would</font>

97
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,600
you have you have access lists that

98
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:11,730
control access to say port 22 on your

99
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:13,560
device<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now I've given you the</font>

100
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:16,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">downside now let me give you the upside</font>

101
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:20,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reason we want to separate the port</font>

102
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:22,210
is because it's possible that<font color="#CCCCCC"> SSH might</font>

103
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:24,349
be used for different purposes like

104
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:27,049
configuration and administration being

105
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:30,620
one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just user access being another</font>

106
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,660
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is do you care do you</font>

107
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,610
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have do you foresee this use as</font>

108
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,280
as something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that where you'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

109
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:39,920
multiple uses and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> so maybe you might</font>

110
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,690
not want access to the configuration

111
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,870
administration for it where you do want

112
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,600
access to ssh so show hands who would

113
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:51,640
like everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one court because the</font>

114
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,590
administration is expensive all right

115
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,270
who would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything on multiple</font>

116
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:01,190
ports to separate out based on

117
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:02,630
functionality<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the general view that</font>

118
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,910
I'm sensing the working group is that

119
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:10,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go with the latter with</font>

120
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:13,550
an option for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to change it okay one</font>

121
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:15,169
final question that I'll ask is the

122
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:17,000
reason that this becomes important is

123
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:19,940
because as you try to configure all this

124
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,010
stuff it means hopping from one computer

125
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,850
one router to another or one switch to

126
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,250
another and actually making

127
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,310
configuration change so just a sense of

128
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,970
the room how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

129
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:33,380
25 devices in their network<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you</font>

130
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,150
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than 25 devices in your</font>

131
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:38,030
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that keep your hands up for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

132
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,669
sec how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you use automated tools</font>

133
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:45,109
to update your configuration files leave

134
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:46,729
your hands up all right how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many those</font>

135
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:48,290
people still have their hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you</font>

136
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:50,450
really do care about this stuff because

137
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">this will simplify your automated tools</font>

138
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:55,849
so my next comments will clarify how you

139
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,100
can participate so<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's some of the</font>

140
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we're thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

141
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,750
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> so pan HTTP and one of the</font>

142
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,430
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we really wanted to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

143
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,740
ponder whether you could use existing

00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,340
companies might provide of course in

this crowd you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you might say ooh</font>

147

Microsoft but in fact you know using

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">existing tool sets is a nice thing and</font>

149
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,010
in as much as you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to write it</font>

150
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,260
yourself similarly if they're pearl

151
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,190
libraries are stuff like that so we're

152
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,289
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide what the right</font>

153

mandatory substrate should be sure to be

<font color="#E5E5E5">soap over HTTP should it be sober of</font>

155
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,370
HTTPS should be s<font color="#E5E5E5"> sa</font>

156
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,190
or should it be beep and we want your

157
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:34,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">input what is the authorization model</font>

158
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,660
that should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used this is a on going</font>

159
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:38,550
discussion right now we don't have a

160
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,490
standard model and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

161
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:44,940
begin<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon i believe so there's a lot of</font>

162
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:47,539
room for input there what sort of

163
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,250
existing tool tool kits can be used

164
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:52,229
locking here's an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've run</font>

into which is while you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have ways</font>

166
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:56,880
to lock a configuration file today

167
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:59,310
depending on your OS if you automate the

168
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,020
process and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you limit lock and and you</font>

169
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:04,260
have an authorization model that allows

170
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:06,510
only limited access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a device then a</font>

171
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,389
global lock can mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a person who</font>

172
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,550
has that global lock can lock things and

resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to</font>

support for different operating models

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,740
this is a big issue there's a modeling

community out there which would like to

see<font color="#E5E5E5"> us all go to sim or stuff like that</font>

I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's one hundred percent</font>

182
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,430
possible but that discussion is just

beginning so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's more information a</font>
