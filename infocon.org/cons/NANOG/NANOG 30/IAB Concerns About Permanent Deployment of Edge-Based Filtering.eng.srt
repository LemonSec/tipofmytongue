IAB posting to none of mailing list on

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:32,668
posting I got I got lots of Christians

8
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:35,460
like for instance why I be has a say to

9
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,940
operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the committee or why this is</font>

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:44,210
about I a big concern so I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:48,269
clarify those questions so basically the

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:51,600
October October email was tortured by

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:57,120
the cisco vulnerability found in<font color="#CCCCCC"> june</font>

the isp responded to the vulnerability

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:20,250
by filtering filtering based on protocol

27
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,350
that the multipliers please plan to

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,770
leave the filtering configuration

29
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:52,679
forever so cities that is the main

<font color="#CCCCCC">concern for the IAB so let me let me</font>

31
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,520
give you some example so here's three

32
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:04,710
iced teas a B and C and the they all

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,229
have vulnerable cisco routers and a and

the middle is the internet exchange

40
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:27,299
first the first bad thing about the

41
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:30,230
featuring at the ebgp router and the

42
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:33,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">note upgrading cisco router is that the</font>

43
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:36,899
attackers could be in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your video</font>

44
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:41,070
customers so filter at the EV 3r rata is

45
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,290
useless could be useless and the this is

46
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,170
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i be concerned about the</font>

47
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:50,130
butt of court but of course this should

48
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:54,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">be operators concern the next one is the</font>

49
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:57,060
theory I be concern these filters

50
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:01,140
prohibit some some of the important

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:04,590
protocols such as bar ipv4 and Kim in

52
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:08,130
the in the case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> June July cisco</font>

53
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:13,140
vulnerability however if you if it was

54
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:15,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP it was it was really horrible it</font>

55
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be really horrible situation and</font>

56
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,600
the key of teacher importance of the

57
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,340
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the extensibility and the</font>

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,820
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> successful</font>

59
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,500
extensive ed is everything for example

60
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:31,560
scalability<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean extent and</font>

61
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,890
sensitivity in size is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

62
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:40,310
thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet for example if</font>

63
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:43,700
new isp comes up and the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> d is be</font>

64
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:46,829
advertised start<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> design routes</font>

65
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,700
there is no need for other ISPs to

66
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:53,310
reconfigure their routers it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy it</font>

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,220
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the ones</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of good property of</font>

68
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:58,829
the scalability of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

69
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,940
another important extensibility is

70
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:05,310
protocol xing extensibility and in indy

71
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:08,400
on the internet it is easy to introduce

72
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,630
new protocols such as for instance HTTP

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">DCC p or some random gaming protocols</font>

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:17,969
and it is not necessary to upgrade

75
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:21,209
routers to introduce new protocols and

76
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,000
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very important for the pudding</font>

77
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,380
successful internet to be successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,830
the filters a TV TV routers we

79
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,320
damage this protocol sensibility think

80
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,440
about the extreme extreme example of

81
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,170
pseudo internet which passes tcp port 80

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,500
traffic only and we cannot call it

83
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:45,290
internet and the it will show you that

84
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,390
the protocol is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to instability is very</font>

85
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:53,180
important for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

86
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:57,710
successful so and and the last ish last

87
00:04:53,180 --> 00:05:01,520
issue so sorry so this was the really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

88
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,719
be concerned if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there is another</font>

89
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,020
incident like this like the june/july

there's more ebgp featuring installed

be very bad for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture of the</font>

96
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,830
internet lastly usually customers are

97
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,830
not notified all filters<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the ev3</font>

98

99
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:44,000
the customers do not have control over

100
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:46,460
the which ebgp rather to be to use to

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
reach sat on this nation so customers

102
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,930
have no idea why<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful to space</font>

filtering for the pin blog or whatever

147
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:09,699
yes the port fielding could could of

148
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,349
course could of course them is the

149
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:16,190
existing validity of the internet and

150
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:20,960
the also also customers will be puzzled

151
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:24,680
when they happened to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to pick</font>

152
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,830
certain port what number or when they

153
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:30,889
are using FTP or something so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

154
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's just no no big</font>

155
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:36,890
distinction between portrait during a

156
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:40,279
protocol number filtering I think but

157
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:43,240
the but the this in this certain case we

158
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:46,790
heard that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of little lot of ISPs</font>

159
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,800
installing features a TV DVD writer

160
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:55,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sunday they they they will stay forever</font>

161
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:58,490
we heard so so we made this

162
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,680
okay let me see if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make the</font>

163
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,120
distinction is it because they're ebgp

164
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:08,420
filters as opposed to filters on usually

165
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,120
on customer links or I'm not really sure

166
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,498
why for example why would the<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye let me</font>

167
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,329
see if I can ask a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> way why</font>

168
00:09:12,499 --> 00:09:16,939
would the IAB have an opinion on this

169
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:19,670
and not on what's going on on edge

170
00:09:16,939 --> 00:09:22,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">filtering in edgewater you mean</font>

171
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:24,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">customized fear thing yeah for the</font>

172
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:28,670
customized filtering normally customers

173
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:33,589
are customer done asking iced teas to

174
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:39,769
feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually or maybe yeah it goes</font>

175
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:41,930
both ways yes so Andy so also the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ivy</font>

than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> edge I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess a very green</font>

180
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,639
Francisco there's no distinction whether

181
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,550
you put the filter on your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer edge</font>

182
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,439
or your period and you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ebgp</font>

incident on my customer edge you lose

187
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:17,059
the service just do it between

autonomous systems and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font>

189

remember those systems have the autonomy

201
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:59,420
thank you so so when you look at

202
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:02,750
enterprise systems right they block

203
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:05,540
these ports so these services are broke

instance company a like the filter

choice and the company a is sprint

distinct this<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a distinction</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">between the leaf leaf site like like</font>

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,260
pokémon provider like strength I guess

224
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:11,810
but see you're making<font color="#CCCCCC"> a distinction</font>

225
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:14,000
where you put it see the service breaks

226
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,829
when when there's a security incident

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,240
and it's any security incident we're

228
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:20,470
getting many of these security incidents

229
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:23,270
out there and people dropping in filters

230
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:25,490
to protect themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> and protect them</font>

231
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:29,840
customers to make sure their businesses

232
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:32,240
keep on working yes but the point<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

233
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,720
as a short on Showtime Showtime walk

234
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,440
around it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to filter however do</font>

235
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,940
not leave leave those filters in forever

236
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,760
but that's my point but as we're seeing

237
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">from security statistics a lot of these</font>

238
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,210
problems never go away I thought police

239
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,700
does plaster slammer a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

240
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,440
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> never go away yeah once once you</font>

241
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,790
know a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit they never go</font>

242
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,490
away then you look at customer patch

243
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,780
rates you know you have customers who

244
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,250
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> patch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your systems because they</font>

245
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:02,930
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about it yet so there's an</font>

246
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,560
industry-wide problem I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think your spit</font>

247
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,060
I think I

248
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:07,640
be specifically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and say</font>

249
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,319
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all my goodness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobility broke and</font>

250
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,990
it's all because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability so</font>

251
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,490
we recommend this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think I abhi</font>

252
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,620
is actually looking at it from the big

picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the whole entire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> context are</font>

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:20,450
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at from a very narrow contact</font>

255
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:24,680
and say oh you broke my protocol mm-hmm

256
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:25,970
you know and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IEDs job to</font>

257
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,550
be looking at something that's such a

258
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,850
narrow focus I'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's exactly the</font>

259
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,469
opposite the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP is taking the Y</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

260
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:34,820
they want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet to continue to</font>

261
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it used to work and not</font>

262
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,300
have it be slowly destroyed by filters

263
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">as pop up everywhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and nobody can</font>

264
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:44,270
control what but then then the IV should

265
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:47,029
be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through and saying here's</font>

266
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,829
here's the conduct is the inherent

267
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:50,990
reasons why and this is what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

268
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,089
be doing which the filters are a

269
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,620
consequence of some other issue their

270
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:56,120
consequences some other issue I that's

271
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,910
right that's right they are your kind of

272
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,740
content consequence of the primarily of

273
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:02,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">Microsoft software and it's incredibly</font>

274
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,790
poor security record it doesn't show any

275
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,560
signs of getting better anytime soon but

276
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:08,209
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much a question of where the</font>

277
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,819
filters are placed but who controls them

278
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay that's the crucial issue does the</font>

279
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,300
end user control the filter or does the

280
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,339
ISP control the filter the ISP is

281
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,079
supposed to be there to do provide a

282
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:19,640
service city and user by putting in a

283
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,870
filter but I did not ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

284
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,580
doing what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to do what I'm</font>

285
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,780
hanging to do if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect my</font>

287
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,310

288
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:29,719

00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,240
play by our rules you pay us or you know

295
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,420
or you move<font color="#E5E5E5"> to somebody else that's</font>

297
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:48,800
but but autonomous systems have autonomy

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:50,120
to control and protect you realize

299
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,620
what's going to happen as a result of

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can simply do</font>

301
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,350
this and get away<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it what will</font>

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen is it everybody's going to start</font>

303
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,100
putting up encrypted filters the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Crypt</font>

304
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,069
the tunnels it seem to get around us and

305
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,900
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon it'll come another worm it</font>

306
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,910
will hit some encrypted tunnels you

307
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,990
won't have any control over it paying

308
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,630
all because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said what we're just</font>

309
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to pull through</font>

310
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,890
don't care what the customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font>

311
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,210
customers in fact have the upper hand

312
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,310
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> being able to bill decrypted</font>

313
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:15,960
tunnels and then everybody will be very

314
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,550
yeah there's lots of unintended

315
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,320
consequences that can happen from it and

316
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,479
there's in the security community we

317
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,520
look at all these very wild unintended

318
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,990
consequences that can happen so the

319
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">point is to think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IAB</font>

320
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:33,330
saying they have a point to what you're

321
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:35,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess i have to commons one</font>

322
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:38,870
is to your<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement about being clear</font>

323
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:41,459
who is a backbone provider and who isn't

324
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:44,250
can you identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself Oh America</font>

325
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,110
theor I work<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Boston University we</font>

326
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,940
have thirty forty thousand systems on

327
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,850
our network we've got private peering

328
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,830
we've got transit peering we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

329
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,650
peers down to customers who<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy is</font>

330
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:57,750
p-type access to us so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

331
00:15:55,650 --> 00:16:00,660
it's not really clear to us are we a

332
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:02,790
backbone and we have small<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP are we an</font>

333
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,439
enterprise so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're</font>

334
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,150
making a very clear distinction<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

335
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,680
what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about in terms of</font>

336
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,740
well this only applies to certain people

337
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,780
but in a practical standpoint it's not

338
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:16,410
really clear who it is that you're

339
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:18,720
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about because for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know am</font>

340
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">i tier 1 because I have X number of</font>

341
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,880
customers a mightier to<font color="#CCCCCC"> am I an</font>

342
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:27,030
enterprise I think the second point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

343
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,670
I like to make is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> although I agree</font>

344
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:31,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">with with the statements about the</font>

345
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:34,650
extensibility and the undead

346
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:36,390
principality in my my boss's office in

00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,829
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CIA's office and the president of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things but then they turn around</font>

350
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,220
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say to me well we have two options</font>

351
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:46,230
we can follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of philosophical</font>

352
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:50,610
path and leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> no filters in place and</font>

353
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:52,080
watch the network meltdown we can spend

354
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:53,700
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money to prevent that network</font>

355
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,910
from melting down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and leave these</font>

356
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,070
filters out or we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a zero cost</font>

357
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,140
solution and just filter out a

358
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:05,970
particular port and I haven't found a

359
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:08,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">good argument to my bosses where I can</font>

360
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,860
justify not putting those filters in

361
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:14,219
from an economic standpoint do you have

362
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:16,909
any words of advice for what I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

363
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,910
to make the argument

364
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:26,428
so you're asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you're asking for</font>

365
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">here you're telling us that you should</font>

366
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:33,539
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain practice yeah and yet</font>

367
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:36,750
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I stand-in in the offices of my</font>

368
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:38,549
boss of my CIO and I say well we have to

369
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,260
follow this guideline and not put

370
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:42,179
filters in and they say why and I say

371
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,520
well sort of philosophically the

372
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet should scale better were we not</font>

373
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,000
to do this and you said well how much is

374
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,789
it going to cost us not to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

375
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,679
filters in well we have to buy a bunch

376
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:54,150
more gear we have to improve our network

377
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,360
capacity we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to hire a bunch of</font>

378
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,559
security people and he says<font color="#CCCCCC"> well what's</font>

379
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cost of putting these filters in</font>

380
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,200
besides ruining this philosophical

381
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:09,570
concept and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer is well about 10</font>

382
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:10,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes worth of work and hmm well what</font>

383
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:14,490
I'm looking for is what is the argument

384
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,380
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i just gave you what the</font>

385
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,820
argument is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually you take off</font>

386
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">your customers and not they will start</font>

387
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,120
building a patchwork of encrypted

388
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:26,129
tunnels you will no longer be able to

389
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,870
filter when the time comes I scope on

390
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:29,730
exactly this point yesterday I said that

391
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:31,770
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kick off your users</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fight start a</font>

392
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:33,690
fight by blocking<font color="#E5E5E5"> an w'en model they</font>

393
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,789
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work around you by setting up</font>

394
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">encrypted tunnels okay and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

395
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,669
that you no longer have any control at

396
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,980
all it becomes the flute<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lee opaque to</font>

397
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:43,559
you and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next blaster worm hits</font>

398
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,000
you will be defenseless that is the cost

399
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:48,539
I mean I hit you now but i'll hit you in

400
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:53,070
the future sorry my name is chris i work

401
00:18:48,539 --> 00:18:55,230
for a reasonably sized network and court

402
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:58,620
but i could you state your name and tuck

403
00:18:55,230 --> 00:19:00,780
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a mic so folks can hear my name is</font>

404
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:03,479
chris and i work for a reasonably sized

405
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:05,490
network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not really going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

406
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,650
my company's perspective on the problem

407
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:08,850
but my personal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operators who</font>

408
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,280
run the network that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i work on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

409
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:13,049
perspective there's two<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces and you</font>

410
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,270
to some extent you're right didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

411
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:16,050
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> name I'm sorry Phil garner Phil</font>

412
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,180
okay

413
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:21,060
I'm sorry I have a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad memory for</font>

414
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:23,880
names so Phil you to some extent you're

415
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:26,550
right if at an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP level you do this</font>

416
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,800
filtering which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IV's concern then</font>

417
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,540
your customers will a be ticked off be

418
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,419
find some way around it and see one ever

419
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,370
fix their problem right so if you look

420
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,020
at problems specifically like virus

421
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:38,250
related problems not not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cisco</font>

422
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:40,350
problems will dilute that one in a

423
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,140
second but virus lit related problems

424
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,600
from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP perspective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can block tcp</font>

425
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:48,480
port 80 and solve code Reds problem on

426
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">my network right of course I'll have a</font>

427
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,430
lot of other problems then so from an

428
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:56,340
ISP perspective that there's a lot of

429
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,670
judicious decision do you want to filter

430
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:00,750
this and be the be the firewall for your

431
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">network or you just want to kind of let</font>

432
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,320
it run rampant and say you guys really

433
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,060
have to clean up<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not an either/or</font>

434
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,189
thing I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're all in</font>

435
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:09,300
agreement that filters within the core

436
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:11,850
have a role when there's an emergency

437
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:13,260
going on when<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blaster is just yet not</font>

438
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing anybody Christopher yeah not</font>

439
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,350
blaster per se but use the cisco<font color="#CCCCCC"> samoyed</font>

440
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:22,380
so so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision comes down for for us</font>

441
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:25,260
for again not not<font color="#E5E5E5"> MCI but for the people</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that run a large network you need to</font>

443
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,470
save your network first and let

00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:33,600
everything else go so if for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cisco</font>

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,380
done with my upgrade path off come the

451
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,840
filters and believe me we got a lot of

452
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">flak for doing that but what you say you</font>

453
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,689
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to protect your own</font>

455
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">or free to filter those that we want</font>

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,340
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't block with a customer's</font>

457
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,649
assuming to each other there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

458
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">big difference right it's that's true</font>

459
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:04,320
but there is a limit to<font color="#CCCCCC"> what filtering</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

460
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:05,880

461
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,480
a decision can i put a thousand line

462
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,429
access list or a four line access list

463
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,440
so

464
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:13,909
I can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> support a thousand line access</font>

465
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">just everywhere so I have to you know</font>

466
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:16,490
make some business decision that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

467
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,439
well I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to filter this for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

469
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,529
everything done as quickly as can't as

470
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:23,689
we can remove all the filters and let

471
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:27,679
everything go and provide exception case

472
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,450
if required so from an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP perspective</font>

473
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,769
you're right you can't filter this you

474
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:32,899
can't be the Internet's firewall it's a

question from the Boston University guy

<font color="#CCCCCC">even filter anybody anyway right so so</font>

497
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:30,469
the core has a performance impact and so

498
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:33,350
pushing filters closer to the edge tends

499
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,450
to increase our performance and the

500
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:37,789
amount of packets we can move hence the

historically has been considered a bad

you from empirical evidence that opaque

data ie an IPSec encrypted tunnel is

508
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,600
recognizable by certain ISPs and they

509
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,499
will filter opaque data if they can't

the IAB position is this is the
