thank you good morning this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:10,740
a retread of a talk I've given a few

<font color="#E5E5E5">times now I was invited to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> speak here or</font>

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,340
invasive any topic of my choice so this

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,100
is one that I feel very<font color="#E5E5E5"> passionate the</font>

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">valence why keep talking about it and</font>

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,770
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the anyone principle</font>

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,310
which I think most of you probably heard

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,810
of we certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard the term and I</font>

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,250
feel very very strongly this is what

11
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:28,380
made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet great in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

12
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:30,300
place but however is under unprecedented

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,890
threat these days and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to</font>

14
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,590
you know what we're fighting<font color="#E5E5E5"> fires in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the trenches spam denial servers that is</font>

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,860
so forth I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we just step back and</font>

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,930
remember that you know the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we</font>

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:41,519
have these problems is because of some

19
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,530
principles that made the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet great</font>

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
in the first place and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to</font>

21
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,329
maintain those principles as we as we

solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve these problems this is a</font>

23
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,329
should be a fairly obvious disclaimer I

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,949
do work for Qualcomm but these are my

25
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,090
own opinions I do think the claw claw to

26
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:58,019
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> me you know whether or not</font>

28
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,949
given several times before I notice

actually very<font color="#CCCCCC"> little was changed just</font>

31
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:08,340
things have gotten kind of you know

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,689
worse in the spam department security

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,010

34
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:15,089
nothing has changed at all in a long

35
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:17,100

not as widely<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plays they should be</font>

only

the peer-to-peer network is actually

bringing his back full circle to the way

basically takes control the network away

using the spectrum that's rather

to do in a Cell your network if we can't
