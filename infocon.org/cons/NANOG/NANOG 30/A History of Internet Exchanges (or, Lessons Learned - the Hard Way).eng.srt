1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,780
okay first a couple of disclaimers the

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:13,049
first one is although<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says seen it</font>

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,730
networks on my slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was told to say</font>

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,529
that this in no way represents anything

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,930
that they publish or whatever they just

6
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">pay my salary and pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for my hotel and</font>

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">all that a sec a disclaimer is that it</font>

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,140
says history in the title but this is

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,840
more of a collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> of war stories in</font>

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,189
an actual chronological history so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,009
bear with it I probably find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more</font>

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,390
entertaining this way though so what

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,329
this really is a sort of an explanation

14
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:43,170
of why my hair is gray okay how do I

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:47,309
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it change slides page down there we</font>

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:50,010
go okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh it didn't work the way I</font>

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,760
wanted it to all right okay so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've</font>

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,019
organized this into is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten myths about</font>

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,870
pairing points exchange points whatever

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,289
you want to call them and with the truth

21
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,500
turned out to be so first myth of course

22
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:07,380
10 mega<font color="#CCCCCC"> base is enough may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> East was</font>

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,060
formed in late 92 when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of</font>

24
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:10,729
internet geeks got together at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mexican</font>

25
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,170
restaurant and herndon virginia and

26
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:14,610
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they didn't want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a</font>

27
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,310
mesh of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea ones too interconnected</font>

28
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,770
networks they wanted something a little

29
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:23,070
faster and hopefully simpler so they

30
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:28,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">bought a metropolitan ethernet service</font>

31
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:32,000
from MF s data net it was a service 10

32
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:36,439
megabits that ran across a ring of ds3 s

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,909
proprietary hardware called magnums and

34
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,779
it actually worked reasonably well for a

35
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,100
while until guess what they started

36
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,070
pushing more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 megabits into it</font>

37
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,990
then it didn't work too well that's when

38
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:50,070
I got involved by the way to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

39
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,610
figure out why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't working when</font>

40
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,689
they were pushing with 10 mega into it

41
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,030
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did after that</font>

42
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,579
was that was right away the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

43
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,439
ethernet switches became reasonably

44
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,389
priced and available so we got one stuck

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,969
it in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're using the magnums</font>

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,380
just to back haul those circuits to the

47
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:08,728
routers that was the other thing that

48
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,560
was unique about the May at the time was

49
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was distributed the writers were not</font>

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,970
co-located with

51
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,280
the the infrastructure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic was</font>

52
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,069
passing around the ds3 so anyway we

53
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,569
brought in the magnums or brought in

54
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,069
this which is used the magnums just to

back<font color="#E5E5E5"> Khalid dividual individual</font>

56
00:02:22,069 --> 00:02:26,179
point-to-point circuits unfortunately at

57
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,530
the same time a cisco made the routers

58
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,900
better so that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually send</font>

59
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,549
packets faster and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> discovered</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

60
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,069
the bag them had this annoying feature

61
00:02:31,549 --> 00:02:35,989
that if you sent a packet with

62
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,149
interfering gap too short but still<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

63
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:40,280
heads back it would stop working and

64
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,859
required<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody to go in power cycle</font>

65
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,970
it to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it start working again these</font>

66
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the kinds of things that one</font>

67
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:52,579
discovers late at night when when the

68
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:57,170
build stashed so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a picture of</font>

69
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:59,239
May East in early 1993 there were as you

70
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:02,089
can see looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> six connections on a</font>

71
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:06,290
shared 10 megabit Ethernet it grew a

72
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:08,269
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> after that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the second</font>

73
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:09,950
myth that I remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing around the</font>

74
00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:11,299
same time early 90s<font color="#CCCCCC"> when I started</font>

75
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,798
<font color="#E5E5E5">playing this game was that it was only</font>

76
00:03:11,299 --> 00:03:14,569
possible to have one exchange in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

77
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:18,199
entire world so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was ready would</font>

78
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:19,429
break somebody proposed this thing

79
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,510
called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the global</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet exchange</font>

80
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,400
where everybody could bring in their

81
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:23,750
routers and it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> caring fabric</font>

82
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,280
and everybody can peer there and that

83
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:28,250
would solve all periods of the entire

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,720
world I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that was scaled to</font>

85
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:34,639
well fortune nobody ever really tried

86
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:38,480
that the reality bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 worked it could</font>

87
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:41,299
deal with a asymmetric pass it could do

88
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,590
hot potato routing so your package acids

89
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,660
disorders<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they need to</font>

90
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">go and you didn't need a center of the</font>

91
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,709
universe like the NSFNET at the top to

92
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,090
make everything work and that was really

93
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:56,810
the big league at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point third myth</font>

94
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,120
in 1993 the NSF came out with this

95
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,329
proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build mass network access</font>

96
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,000
points what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> really wanted was more</font>

97
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:08,090
carbon copies of May<font color="#E5E5E5"> East or something</font>

98
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,620
like it scattered around the country so

99
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,799
then they figured out that distributing

100
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,209
them was<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I came out this</font>

101
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,849
notation which is part of a bigger

102
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:20,750
solicitation to essentially privatize

103
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:22,120
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it would keep the R&E stuff</font>

104
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,669
separate from the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

105
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,110
old and let provide mechanisms for

106
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,680
commercial internet providers to connect

107
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:31,210
and and everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be wonderful so</font>

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,000
of course everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> all telco saw this</font>

109
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,310
said hey free money from the government

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,030
so everybody tried to build their own

111
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:42,520
nap design and submit it including us

112
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:47,169
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> eventually three three-and-a-half</font>

113
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,639
naps were awarded but as we saw it was

114
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:51,240
entirely possible to build a successful

115
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,699
exchange point didn't have NSF blessing

116
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,410
Mae West packs whole bunches of regional

117
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:57,639
exchanges all over the place not to

118
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,510
mention the international ones like

119
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,560
links are proof that the NSF doesn't

120
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,909
have to bless something to make it

121
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,010
useful oh this one was one of my

122
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:11,139
favorites join may<font color="#CCCCCC"> East pier with the</font>

123
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,430
world there were people who actually

124
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">believed that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

126
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:22,240
to buy transit from anybody this was due

127
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,960
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some clueless sales people and some</font>

128
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,630
clueless<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp wannabes who bleed what</font>

129
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,820
they thought they heard the reality of

130
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:32,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">course was that some of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> large ISPs</font>

131
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:35,110
back then were beginning to realize that

132
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:39,070
they didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be with every mom</font>

133
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:42,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">and pop regional ISP in rural Virginia</font>

134
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,950
or whatever that there was actually some

135
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,409
money to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> made by selling them things</font>

136
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:49,389
so you net and branch and all those

137
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,740
others at some point started saying no

138
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,490
we won't appear with you will sell you

139
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,080
stuff so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP wannabes quickly</font>

140
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,760
learned that that was going to work and

141
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,349
either but transit or went away or

I took a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful week long trip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

148
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:19,990
Switzerland to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a million Zurich</font>

149
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:22,539
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is they never actually got</font>

150
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,340
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rent to selling it so nobody came</font>

151
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:28,030
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it went away as far as i know</font>

152
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,609
the hardware still sitting there myth

153
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,469
number 6 100 megabits is enough well you

154
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,710
can see with number one for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer</font>

155
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:36,330
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

156
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:40,620
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> East had by this time evolved into a</font>

157
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:42,060
shared ftdi ring because 100 megabits

158
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,680
was faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 10 and people who</font>

159
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,300
connect and colocation would be really

160
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,789
cool and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the fix worked</font>

161
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,009
and variety of reasons and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a good</font>

162
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:53,039
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a little while but it filled up</font>

163
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:56,340
amazing so the mortal the story is

164
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:58,590
shared media will fill up wherever you

165
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,539
have it you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plan</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for that you</font>

166
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:02,520
need to have an upgrade path ready for

167
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:07,710
when it does if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then people</font>

168
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:11,340
complain myth number<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven caring means</font>

169
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:14,419
never having to say you're sorry the

170
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:17,039
Giga switch that gigas which was our

171
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:21,029
hardware of choice for<font color="#CCCCCC"> may east of my</font>

00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,289
installing them and getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up as fast</font>

174
00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:29,039
as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could I think packs had one</font>

175
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:30,688
installed by them<font color="#E5E5E5"> too and even gigas</font>

176
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,849
which was a wonderful piece of 1970s

177
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:37,379
technology unfortunately we're in the

178
00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:38,400
90s and the gigas which fell apart over

179
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,800
the load that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to push</font>

180
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">upon it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular it was an input</font>

181
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,770
buffered switch and suffered from this

182
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,050
phenomenon called head of line blocking

183
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:49,080
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we all understand now but</font>

184
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,550
back then it was sort of well we have

185
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,378
100 megabits who'd ever want to push

186
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:57,960
that much data through well we did so in

187
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:59,879
early 97 Steven Stewart who worked for

188
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,460
digital at the time was up apologizing

189
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:04,409
for the Giga switch in front of nanog by

190
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:05,878
the end of 97 we still hadn't been able

191
00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:07,169
to do a whole lot about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because there</font>

192
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,389
was no upgrade path available at the

193
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,339
time so I showed up at an end up meeting

194
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:16,620
wearing a target and let people throw

195
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:19,550
things at me myth number<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight just IX</font>

196
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,550
is deep disco lights

197
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:26,000
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go this isn't an actual</font>

198
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:32,150
exchange point this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dramatic</font>

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:34,099
recreation of one but for a long time

200
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the most successful exchange point in</font>

201
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:43,099
the US was in a place that looked like

202
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:51,140
this amazed ok myth number<font color="#CCCCCC"> nine ATM will</font>

203
00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:52,430
fix everything 9b ATM is<font color="#E5E5E5"> useless well as</font>

204
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:55,400
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have guessed the truth is</font>

205
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:57,680
somewhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> between there were</font>

successful itm based naps that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

208
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:04,579
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how to follow too closely</font>

209
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:06,920
anymore what extent they have a market

210
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">share but they're there it took a long</font>

211
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,610
time to make the mark took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time</font>

212
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:14,569
to figure out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need buffering</font>

213
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:15,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> switch is that you need to do some</font>

214
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,970
nice traffic shaping instead of just

215
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:21,890
hard policing various things but the

216
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,720
lesson I learned<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that was HTM is a</font>

217
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:25,280
tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the toolbox and there are places</font>

218
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,010
where could be appropriate and if it is

219
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,439
use it if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not then don't should be</font>

220
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:34,939
a simple is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that right religion got in a</font>

221
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:39,470
way but what though and finally my last

222
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,760
one layer 2 is easy no with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ethernet</font>

223
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,980
you have all sorts of fun things like

224
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,390
spanning tree to worry about bridging

225
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,310
loops to worry about yeah maybe you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

226
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:52,130
just plug<font color="#CCCCCC"> and play a simple layer 2</font>

227
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,890
topology but when you start growing it

228
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,930
to enough switches when you start

229
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,720
putting funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in there it gets</font>

230
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:03,170
really complex and leads to some really

231
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:06,080
interesting troubleshooting<font color="#E5E5E5"> times loops</font>

232
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,130
being of course my favorite that took<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

233
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,890
long time to figure out was going on

234
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:12,170
there the other layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 technology we</font>

235
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:14,300
used was virtual circuits HTM

236
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">frame-relay started playing with mpls a</font>

237
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,949
little bit what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was still there that</font>

238
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:23,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">leads</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a different set of problems</font>

239
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,800
path asymmetry being one of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

240
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,079
the switch pretends that you have a

241
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,910
bi-directional virtual circuit between

242
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:31,460
your endpoints what you really have is

243
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,670
two unidirectional circuits they may lie

244
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,730
to you about it pretend

245
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:38,579
have to but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if half of it goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down the</font>

246
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:39,890
other half stays up some routing

247
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:43,130
protocols don't deal with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

248
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:46,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">two particularly well so we learned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

249
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:50,040
and as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> before policing just hard</font>

250
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,870
rate limiting on a virtual circuit these

251
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">two some nasty effects with TCP which</font>

252
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:57,330
doesn't like that we learned after a

253
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,950
while that shaping to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

254
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:00,990
traffic match what the switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants is</font>

255
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:03,930
far better than just having the switch

256
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:05,670
try to enforce what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wants and then of</font>

257
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:07,189
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the hybrids this is when</font>

258
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:12,270
you try to do both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font>

259
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:13,890
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever heard of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> net edge this way</font>

260
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:16,380
you get to have the worst features of

261
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:19,850
both worlds you could have bridging

262
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:25,410
loops and ATM problems at the same time

263
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:28,710
so I know this is a sort of my lesson of

264
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,319
what not to do when building a nap these

265
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:32,970
are lessons that I learned pretty much

266
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,330
the hard way over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years of doing this</font>

267
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:38,010
and this I'm sure I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> go into more</font>

268
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,220
detail war stories about all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

269
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,710
anybody really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to hear them but I'm</font>

270
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:45,930
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people will keep making the</font>

271
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,000
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> mistakes over and over again I keep</font>

272
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,939
hearing about them I heard yesterday

273
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,850
about somebody who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build a an</font>

274
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,790
exchange with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece of fiber between</font>

275
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:59,910
one city in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US and some city like a</font>

276
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,349
thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> miles away in the US I'll go</font>

277
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:05,790
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the one of that shared</font>

278
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:07,950
media fills up anyway those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are my</font>

279
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:11,780
lessons hope somebody benefits from me

280
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,780
someday and thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for listening</font>
