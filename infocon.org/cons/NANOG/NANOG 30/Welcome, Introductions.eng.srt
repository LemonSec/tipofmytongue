00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,090
some meetings that were held during the

meetings the NSFNET era began in the mid

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:07,320
1980s when a 56 kilobits interlinked the

17

the National Science Foundation had

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:17,509
established that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network was soon</font>

replaced by t1 network linking 13 sites

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:40,150
observed that there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> history if</font>

you will than that and we've been many

that network began in the fall<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1969 one</font>

respective is that same year that same

53
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,230
fall is when merit began to assemble

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:16,480
staff and plan and start implementation

55
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,560

58
00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:32,260
1971 and I think I can observe that as

other information about anything else

that might suggest another network i'd

65
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,790
appreciate knowing but Mara has a long

and proud involvement in history and

67
00:03:52,790 --> 00:04:01,700
networking world<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call attention to the</font>

many sets that's essentially the span of

70
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:10,099
years almost 35 now that constitutes

71
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:15,379
what we would otherwise consider the

76
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:35,630
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about going from 1969 35 years</font>

77
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:39,859
and or the beginning of the NSFNET era

roughly 16 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> or 10 years now</font>

who are new that we are a merit network

we are based at the University of

gopher the growth of traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning</font>

151
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:21,030
months of 95 when the regional networks

152
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:25,950
were detaching from the NSFNET and

153
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:29,310
moving to other backbones this was all

154
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,590
part of NSF's grand plan that had always

155
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,959
been the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the NSFNET</font>

156
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,540
architecture would be redone replaced

157
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,320
and renewed in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> might in the mid-90s</font>

158
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,360
that our backbone the NSFNET would be

159
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,830
replaced by many commercial backbones

160
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,810
connected at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network access points</font>

161
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:52,610
commercial ISPs first began to<font color="#E5E5E5"> appear</font>

162
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:55,650
during that time but back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this chart</font>

163
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:58,200
overall on the NSFNET traffic grew about

164
00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:01,949
eleven percent a month and doubled every

165
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,630
seven months nowadays it is of course

166
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:05,880
impossible to tell exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much</font>

167
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,490
traffic is out there but we at nana have

168
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,530
a very special tool we can use to<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font>

169
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:12,810
turn to to give us reliable information

170
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,930
about the current health of the internet

171
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that is of course the price for</font>

172
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:23,400
cookie at nanog this was a calculation

173
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:25,589
launched by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bill Norton years ago and of</font>

course<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've very assiduously continued</font>

175
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:36,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">since more seriously still dismal um see</font>

176
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:39,510
that is not funny I don't think frankly

177
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:41,790
still really low numbers of women at

178
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,710
nanog although this is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

179
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,709
I've seen where we've actually reached

180
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,710
almost ten percent still way down I

181
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,209
thank you a lot of our speakers this

182
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,819
time are women as well I heard a

183
00:10:56,209 --> 00:11:00,500
depressing statistic and NPR in January

184
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:02,899
it was a report of a study done at 50

185
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,370
colleges and universities of all the

186
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:06,110
professorships in science and

187
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:12,500
engineering at those schools only three

188
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:14,750
to five percent were held by women our

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,250
