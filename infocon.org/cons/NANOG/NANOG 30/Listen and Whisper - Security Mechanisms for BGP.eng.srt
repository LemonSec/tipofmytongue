of us know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> HP security is an</font>

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:29,339
important problem why bgp as a protocol

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,308
today blindly assumes whatever

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:35,610
information you get from neighbors to be

9
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">correct now if a router starts</font>

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,989
propagating bogus announcements which

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,440
can potentially happen due to

12
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">misconfigurations or malicious behavior</font>

13
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:48,449
then you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of drastic</font>

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:52,160
effects let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me explain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of them so</font>

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:55,230

pretends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be malicious and propagates</font>

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:02,608
a bogus route saying it can reach CNN

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,880
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> X believes rather node C and D</font>

19
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,159
believe the advertisement and choose

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,030
this route due to its<font color="#E5E5E5"> local preference</font>

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,670
and the route now goes through m and M

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,869
can just drop the packets in that sense

23
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:21,810
it can render the network unreachable a

24
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:25,680
more sophisticated attack is it can

25
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,630
impersonate with the CNN<font color="#E5E5E5"> prime and serve</font>

26
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,950

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,259
credit card server impersonation or even

28
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">worse you could just forward the packet</font>

29
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,420
on what other routes you have and you

30
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:41,700
can just eat stop on the traffic all

31
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,159
these are serious attacks and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basic</font>

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,920
problem is a router propagates bogus

33
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,090
announcements how do you deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,520
now there are several real world

35
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,250
examples misconfigurations have been

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,500

look through the nanog mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,750
if you actually dig through them

44
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,629
some of the emails by rob thomas and

45
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:21,030
other people show that several router

46

55
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:50,280
on routers what will we do I consider

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:53,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a doomsday scenario now there are</font>

57
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,900
two basic types of invalid routes in BGP

58
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,420
now whenever we say a router propagates

59
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:03,959
invalid routes we talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> invalid</font>

60
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,450
routes in the control plane where

61
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,310
somebody propagates a route which is

62
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">non-existent and tries to drive out</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic but on the other hand a recent</font>

64
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:16,078
work by<font color="#E5E5E5"> modeling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mouse showed that</font>

65
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:18,060
several routes in the data plane that is

66
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:21,239
the actual path taken by the route in

67
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:22,829
the data plane does not match the route

68
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:24,889
in the control thing I mean that can

69
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:29,459
happen due to several legitimate reasons

70
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:32,120
but the bottom line is if we verify the

71
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,829
routes in the control plane it may be

72
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,510
insufficient just because the

73
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,849
advertisements in the control plane are

74
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:42,239
correct it does not imply that the data

75
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:44,429

76
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,329
bottom<font color="#CCCCCC"> line or out of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> argument we</font>

77
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:50,190
need to verification techniques one to

78
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,910
verify correctness in the control plane

79
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:57,419
and number two to verify<font color="#E5E5E5"> correctness in</font>

80
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:00,510
the data plane and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what</font>

81
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:03,090
we do we develop two techniques one

82
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:06,120
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> we call as listen and the other</font>

83
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:09,250
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we call as whisper motivated</font>

84
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,780
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chinese games actually</font>

85
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:14,810
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this old Chinese game called</font>

86
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,420
listen and whisper so we got the name

87
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:19,519
from that and whisper basically does

88
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:21,500
control plane verification and listen

89
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,710
basically does data plane verification

90
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,850
and the basic problem we try to address

91
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:32,719
is what best security can be provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

92
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:35,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP without using a public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,180
infrastructure now why do I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

94
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,640
there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> several very good</font>

95
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:43,670
proposals for improving BGP security

96
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:46,180
secur<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP secure origin BGP and they</font>

97
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:52,040
have faced several deployment problems

98
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:54,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">pki is not just about performance issues</font>

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,620
and so on there might be even political

100
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,290
issues in deploying a big year for

101
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:04,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">example whoever owns the root of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pki</font>

102
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:07,430
has tremendous power and situations like

107
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,990
base solution is deplorable or not too

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,940
pliable I don't want to argue<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but</font>

109
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,030
the bottom line is we might also want to

110
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:35,719
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> research on what are solutions</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">without using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up again just a brief</font>

112
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,180
comparison to related work there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

113
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,760
several p care solutions which offer

114
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,950
very good security but my premises they

115
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,810
are hard would apply and primarily they

116
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,760
look at control plane verification as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

117
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,220
briefly said a couple of minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and</font>

118
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,349
there are some ad hoc solutions which

119
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,380
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use centralized</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> databases and</font>

120
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,230
these databases are incomplete and they

121
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,900
offer very little security properties

122
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:04,970
there's some nice work by themes to

checking tools and some other folks as

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,870
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is very useful is very</font>

126
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,840
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for detecting misconfigurations</font>

127
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:16,160
however it primarily applies to control

128
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,310
plane miss configurations and may not

129
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply to data plane</font>

130
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,000
on the other hand there's another work

by modeling now and Jennifer<font color="#CCCCCC"> rexford</font>

this area which is useful for data plane

134
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,610
probing and so one could think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">combination of these two to deal with</font>

with malicious behavior now our work

00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,750
tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide the following</font>

guarantees in the control plane we

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,240
provide the ability to trigger an alarm

141
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:51,360
that is whenever somebody tries to

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,260
going wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over here as</font>

149
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,000
I will get in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little second is we</font>

might not able always be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

151
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,860
pinpoint the<font color="#CCCCCC"> source of the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

152
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">when somebody tries to attack the</font>

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,469
invalid routes then we can contain the

00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,860
without sending any additional packets

161
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:45,480
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely based and password</font>

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,270

164
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:55,229
more detail so the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

165
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:57,080
between a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki based approach and our</font>

168
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:07,500
in our case<font color="#E5E5E5"> we define the notion of a</font>

169
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:11,280
route consistency test where each route

00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:14,910
is associated with some hash value we

171
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,830
call it HP in this case and a single

172
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:20,310
route advertisement by itself does not

173
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,859
have any meaning but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take to</font>

174
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:25,650
such router advertisements to the same

176
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:30,688
or destination prefix then you can

177
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,610
compare the signatures

178
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:34,439
of these two and see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> weather they</font>

179
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,039
are consistent with each other now what

180
00:08:34,438 --> 00:08:41,068
does consistency mean now if both the

181
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,979
routes are genuine that is if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a is</font>

182
00:08:41,068 --> 00:08:47,670

the set of a SS it traversed nothing has

184
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:53,370

185
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,899
both the routes are genuine then the

00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,569
route consistency test should tell you

187
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they are consistent if one is</font>

188
00:08:57,569 --> 00:09:02,550
genuine one is furious it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

189
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,769
tell you that they are inconsistent but

190
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:07,069
if you have both<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them to be spurious</font>

191
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:09,000
that is at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one malicious node or</font>

192
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:10,170
misconfigured node in both the parts

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,610
then you really can't say what the

194
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:16,229
testers now in a while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will tell you</font>

195
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:18,629
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to construct this test in the next</font>

196
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,069
slide actually but before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what does</font>

197
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:22,170
route consistency give you what does

198
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:24,740
this abstract concept give you it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives</font>

199
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,000
you the ability to trigger an alarm

200
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:29,399
assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody in this world is</font>

201
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:34,079
good and there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> one bad person who</font>

202
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:36,089
propagates invalid rocks then if he is

203
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,638
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attack a particular</font>

204
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,379
destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and he is not on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

205
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,149
path to the destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and</font>

206
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,639
tries to get into the path then there

207
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:47,970
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> two advertisements one from the good</font>

208
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,490
node and two from the attacker so if you

209
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,399
consider why to be the attacker ABCD

210
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,920
will be good but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the route propagated by</font>

211
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">Y might be back so you'll always have</font>

212
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:03,180
two routes to compare at some es in

213
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:05,129
which case you the node D will be able

214
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,888
<font color="#E5E5E5">to trigger a long I'm saying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

215
00:10:05,129 --> 00:10:09,360
is going on so the basic concept of<font color="#CCCCCC"> road</font>

216
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:12,300
consistency gives you the ability to

217
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,839
trigger on a la now how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you exactly</font>

218
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:19,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">do it now this slide has some math in it</font>

219
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,930
but let me give you the abstract concept

220
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,480
there's a node a which starts with the

221
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:27,930
sea which is which I have constructed

222
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,629
based on our essay and what every

223
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:33,479
intermediary<font color="#E5E5E5"> is every node in this</font>

224
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:36,389
figure as an ass like these nails so

225
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,920
consider be to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single router in an</font>

226
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:43,199
ace what B does is it gets a signature s

227
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,140
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> form jeepers V the whole</font>

228
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:48,939
bar a<font color="#E5E5E5"> mod</font>

229
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:51,160
n and just exponentiate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that is if I</font>

230
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:55,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a signature s it computes as power</font>

231
00:10:51,160 --> 00:11:00,790
be modern now what is n n is a product

232
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:05,410
of two primes given n<font color="#E5E5E5"> RSA guarantee is</font>

233
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:07,170
that you cannot factor in and what does

234
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">it mean for us then somebody</font>

235
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:12,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">exponentiate seeeeee a signature with</font>

236
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:17,640
their a s number and appends the

237
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,640
signature in the BGP route advertisement

238
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,510
nobody else can remove it so I repeat if

239
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I add an alias number to the a's path</font>

240
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:29,620
and i append the signature you cannot

241
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,890
remove it because you cannot compute

242
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,290
discrete logarithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that is the basis</font>

243
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:37,180
of this construction however if you

244
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,180
consider the two signatures s1<font color="#E5E5E5"> and s2</font>

245
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,680
one is g / z the whole power ABC and the

246
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:45,219
other one is he / z the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> part a</font>

247
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,199
times X times y what is different in one

248
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,140
case x and y are there and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other</font>

249
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,690
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> b and c are there so you take these</font>

250
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,939
two signatures and exponentiate with

251
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:58,500
whatever is missing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you take s1</font>

252
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:01,150
and you exponentiate with x and y and

253
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:04,120
you take s2 and you take with

254
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:07,030
exponentiate with BNC and you basically

255
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,330
get the you need these two to be equal

256
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:13,589
for them to be actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent so if</font>

257
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:19,630
anybody tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manipulate the AS path</font>

258
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:21,970
these two will not be<font color="#CCCCCC"> equal so if one of</font>

259
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,220
the routes is genuine the other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

260
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,320
furious will always do notice an

261
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,750
inconsistency because you cannot also

262
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,970
compute the signature you don't know GPR

263
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,420
see the whole power for a given path so

264
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:38,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have five more minutes so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

265
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:41,829
useful for consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> an oh damn that is</font>

266
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:45,700
propagating<font color="#E5E5E5"> three bogus rocks 12 a 12 B</font>

267
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:49,150
and want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see in this case you get</font>

268
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:52,930
three pairs of consistency testing da ma

269
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:54,970
e be m b and f CMC and you'll notice

270
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all these three pairs to three</font>

271
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,769
different destinations are inconsistent

272
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:03,540
so you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> three inconsistent</font>

273
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:06,010
router advertisements from em one

<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting aspect of the previous</font>

275
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:12,880
construction is if to a sparks are

276
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:17,860
inconsistent with each other then at

277
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:21,060
least one is furious and the liar is so

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:23,800
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> present in one of the A's parts</font>

279
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,510

280
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,819

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:35,500
assign penalty values to ejs and in this

283
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,089
case penalty of em becomes<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 just the</font>

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,640
number of router advertisements to

285
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,140
different destinations and you just

286
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,339
choose the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route for the least penalty</font>

287
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:47,019
and that way you will avoid<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so what</font>

00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,180
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it look like in it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

assume that all the tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones deploy</font>

290
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,420
this defense then the remaining portion

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:04,240
if there is one attacker in one of those

293
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:05,800
clouds you can show that that attacker

294
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,079
in the worst case if that is the only

295
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,790
attacker it's an isolated adversary case

296
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,819
this argument does not work for

297
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,740
colluding adversary's case if that is

298
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only attacker then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can only</font>

299
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,410
affect people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that cloud and what the</font>

300
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:23,200
next graph tries to show is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

301
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:25,510
portion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that region is only one</font>

302
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,920
percent of the internet topology now we

303
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,529
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the details of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a graph</font>

304
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,719
later what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've shown is the fraction of</font>

305
00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,250
nodes vulnerable to the attack which is

306
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:34,810
the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that cloud and I've shown</font>

307
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,550
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cumulative distribution and you can</font>

308
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,680
read off the median value to be one

309
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:44,339
percent so the containment region is

310
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,630
limited to one percent of the topology

311
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:48,610
now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a simple slide which</font>

312
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:49,990
shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have implemented the whole</font>

313
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,940
stuff in a router in a zebra

314
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:54,640
implementation and it actually works

315
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">very well so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all our operations</font>

316
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,620
cryptographic operations can be power we

317
00:14:57,579 --> 00:15:01,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">can process it at a rate of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 100,000</font>

318
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:05,410
advertisements per minute so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

319
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:08,140
essentially offload it to a cpu while

320
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:08,620
the maximum load observed today is 9300

321

<font color="#CCCCCC">advertised</font>

322

as per minute as per sprint<font color="#E5E5E5"> mons website</font>

323
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:19,150
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times the current</font>

324
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,710
rate so it's no big deal now let me

325
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,140
briefly summarize the data<font color="#CCCCCC"> plane</font>

326
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:25,360
verification the basic approach of the

327
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,390
data plane verification is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to</font>

328
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,670
TCP connections if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> observe a syn</font>

329
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:35,620
packet followed by a data packet at her

330
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:39,790
out for one flow for one prefix it means

331
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the route works why if the sin is</font>

332
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,319
followed by a data it means that the sin

333
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,880
has been acknowledged so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> router is</font>

334
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,400
working you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have received a response</font>

335
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,360
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the destination now there are two</font>

336
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,150
possible scenarios of false positives or

337
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:58,540
false negatives one app or scanner sends

338
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,329
only syn packets so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

339
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,400
the route does not work based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or</font>

340
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:07,720
the false positive scenario is an

341
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,990
adversary sense in and data packets

342
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,340
without receiving acts now we have

343
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,720
developed defenses for both these

344
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:16,270
techniques now I won't get into the

345
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,090
details and we've deployed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> our local</font>

346
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">area network for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 45 months and</font>

347
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:26,350
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> observed several routing</font>

348
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:28,439
problems so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary there are three</font>

349
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,570
basic types of problems

350
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:35,050
misconfigurations isolated adversities

351
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:37,240
and colluding adversaries now the set of

352
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,209
defenses have briefly explained do not

353
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,310
work very well for colluding adversaries

354
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:44,650
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am I believe it's a good first</font>

355
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,839
line of defense there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't use a</font>

356
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">pki and you get good protection against</font>

357
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,680
isolated adversely and whenever somebody

358
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:52,990
propagates a bogus announcement we can

359
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:55,540
trigger an alarm and we can trigger data

360
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:59,260
plane inconsistencies and we can also

361
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,760
contain a single node but it does not

362
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:02,080
work well when you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a large-scale</font>

363
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:05,849
bomb attack or you have colluding

364
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,850
adversaries thank you

365
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:17,400
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we have time for one</font>

366
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:20,550
question if anybody has one and identify

367
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,260
yourself David Barack AT&T given the

368
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,639
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of routes would in the in the</font>

369
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,349
global table which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> currently</font>

370
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,760
advertised by inconsistent autonomous

371
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:33,719
systems how would would whisper I would

372
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,400
whisper deal with that sorry can you

373
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,840
repeat your question sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a</font>

374
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,660
large number of routes in the global

375
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,169
table which are inconsistent and our

376
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,730
normal because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people announce them from</font>

377
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">a variety of different different</font>

378
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:51,570
autonomous<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems so what wouldn't</font>

379
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:54,960
those be tagged as inconsistent be a

380
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:57,300
whisper also for example if you do parts

381
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,330
to thing which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a common thing today</font>

382
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,530
it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> triggered as an inconsistency</font>

383
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:05,120
no I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes which are</font>

384
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,840
which are just in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> you unique as in</font>

385
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:12,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world that are completely</font>

386
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:16,560
inconsistent so do different origin a SS

387
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:19,500
if the origin is actually advertises

388
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:21,270
them and generates the initial signature

389
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,840
even if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> virtualized number</font>

390
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:26,700
which is not repented in the path and if

391
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,629
it is a multi-homed customer it will not

392
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:35,280
return along<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you have a path</font>

394
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:42,000

00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:01,560
trigger on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allah but if you have going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">through multiple or the providers</font>

themselves generating whisper signatures

00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:09,420
then it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely draw them along</font>

404
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:10,980
does that answer your question no I'm

405
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:13,770
not completely sure you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it</font>
