00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,280
my name is Jurgis<font color="#CCCCCC"> ganos and Caleb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Connor</font>

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok my name is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Georgie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honest and me page</font>

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,149
the student at the University of

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,969
California Riverside I'm really excited

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,650
to present my work here at<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanoha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

6
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,369
hope you know my excitement doesn't mess

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,519
up my presentation so today I'm going to

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,619
talk about our<font color="#CCCCCC"> to nemesis and present</font>

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,288
the brief analysis on the Internet

10
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:30,689
routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> registers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the quality of</font>

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:32,669
the information they contain so

12
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the Internet routing registers</font>

13
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:37,140
where registries were established as I

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,669
mean to improve the cooperation<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,950
autonomous systems and the vision was to

16
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,350
have a stable analyzable internet using

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,030
the Internet routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> registries</font>

18
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,789
basically they allow an autonomous

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,800
system to register its policy which

20
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,199
means basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> register what they are</font>

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,718
named what the neighbors of the ASR<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,550
what they import from their neighbors of

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:07,080
what they export to their neighbors<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:09,298
so so so in reality though the irr as

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,060
implemented today they just tore these

26
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,770
policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> as clear-text ok so in the</font>

27
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,049
registries they are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't exist any</font>

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,360
consistency checks so we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

29
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,060
which registries are correct or which

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,400
they register with sorry which

31
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,830
registrations are not correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and which</font>

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,180
registrations are not fresh and to the

33
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,979
best of our knowledge that does not

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,220
exist a tool that are analyzed these

35
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,320
policies so our goal is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide the</font>

36
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,270
systematic approach and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool to</font>

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,250
analyze this polish and be able to

38
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify the polish that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> correct and</font>

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,590
fresh so in order to do this we have two

40
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,780
phases<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first phase we check</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

41
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,420
errors in the second phase will check

42
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,000
for freshness using the external source

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,759
of source of data like bit soupy routing

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,159
tables and that will consist of two

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,990
parts we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the backend that we use</font>

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,810
the Postgres database to store the

47
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,399
policies and all the analysis and we'll

48
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a web page from them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,899
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cure your database and find out</font>

50
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,790
possible errors that we found the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRR</font>

51
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:17,939
and the results i'm going to present

52
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:20,760
they are from jun 22 2003 so today they

53
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:24,000
exist over 50 registers worldwide some

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,790
of them are regional like ripe in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe</font>

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to be in the America up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nick</font>

56
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,470
in bayesian pacific<font color="#E5E5E5"> regimes and some of</font>

57
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,319
them are provider based so basically an

58
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,840
AS maintain its own registry in order to

59
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,200
publish its police information and the

60
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,420
information of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers so the</font>

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">biggest registry of all is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right which</font>

62
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,358
has over 6,300 their autonomous systems

63
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:52,139
that actually register import and export

64
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:55,709
filters we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit over 2,000</font>

65
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:59,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">AES for both ripe a for both array to be</font>

66
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,319
adapting and we just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 a years</font>

67
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:06,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">is for the rest it's worth noting here</font>

68
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:09,480
that on average an Aes in ripe registers

69
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:12,359
1212 neighbors that has links with 12

70
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,048
neighbors while in their ATP they only

71
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:18,180
register six in a APNIC disaster three

72
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,150
and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the registers the</font>

73
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">average is six of course the important</font>

74
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not how many a yes is the</font>

75
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,659
registered a polish at some point in the

76
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,079
past but how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many they maintain their</font>

77
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:34,409
policy VAR correct and you know up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

78
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:37,530
date so the first test we can have is

79
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:40,019
you can check is both pills register

80
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,449
each other so in this simple example

81
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,329
that we have here we have the policy of

82
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:47,790
phase one so a show on register that has

83
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:50,879
a link with a is too so what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

84
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,069
find out is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there exists if we have a</font>

85
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,899
registration for a link between<font color="#E5E5E5"> s1 and</font>

86
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:58,168
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to do you have the reverse</font>

87
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,989
direction so does the data is to

88
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:03,510
register<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it has a link with a s1 so</font>

89
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:06,180
we compute the percentage of their links

90
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,459
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both directions / registry</font>

91
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,459
and we find out that from forty-nine

92
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,919
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the links in the right there</font>

93
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,540
exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reverse direction while for</font>

94
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,000
error to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the percentage solely</font>

95
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,339
fourteen percent for APNIC is even lower

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,570
its six percent and for the rest it's

97
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:25,469
sixteen percent now in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case when</font>

98
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,750
both

99
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:30,060
directions exist we want to take if the

100
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,910
filters they register is the same so

101
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,190
again in our simple example if a swan

102
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:38,040
registers that from a astute will report

103
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:41,219
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> dazhe is to register that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we will</font>

104
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:43,830
export<font color="#CCCCCC"> where's 1b and again we compute</font>

105
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,370
this / register and we find out that for

106
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:49,530
I've forty-nine percent of of this case

107
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,420
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they use the same filter for</font>

108
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:55,609
array<font color="#CCCCCC"> debates forty percent for APNIC</font>

109
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:58,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's 38 and for the rest of them is 56</font>

110
00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:00,810
so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next thing the next thing you</font>

111
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,080
want to do is check the policy of a is

112
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:06,030
an isolation so is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police has</font>

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,460
registered correct in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

114
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,890
you have to match what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS imports</font>

115
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,080
and what the a s exports so in this

116
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:16,140
example here in the small example we

117
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:19,169
have that this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s exports a</font>

118
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:21,210
B and C so from where<font color="#E5E5E5"> does it import</font>

119
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:23,909
them how<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't know they say B and say</font>

120
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,849
okay so see originates from within the

121
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:29,100
AES a comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the left link becomes</font>

122
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,620
from the right link so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

123
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,660
to compute you know from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the low low</font>

124
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:36,840
level policy won't compute the league

125
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:40,880
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy and be able to check if the</font>

126
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,679
policy is complete and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also I correct so</font>

127
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,500
the test for consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use are</font>

128
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">two we have two different kinds of tests</font>

129
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,820
the first one we call them polish base

130
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,190
test and basically we check the

131
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,080
correctness of the policy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means</font>

132
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we want to save in the important</font>

133
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,940
sport are consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if the link</font>

134
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,340
level policies metal and then we check

135
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,070
the freshness of the policy and by

136
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:06,869
freshness and basically we use the BGP

137
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,840
routing tables to check the freshness

138
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,960
and we require<font color="#CCCCCC"> that all piece of all</font>

139
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,179
periods of an ASR found in BGP must be

140
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,880
registered in<font color="#CCCCCC"> IRR and also the</font>

141
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,300
high-level policy of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> aes should be</font>

142
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,830
the same in both<font color="#E5E5E5"> BJP NT nayara basically</font>

143
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,479
there are heuristics that can extract

144
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,490
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level polish from bit soupy</font>

145
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,250

146
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:31,650
my RR so if in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits of paths you</font>

147
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:33,960
have particular areas as your upstream

148
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,690
we expect to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing in IRR</font>

149
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,969
so if any of this test fails then

150
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:43,019
consider that this

151
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:45,299
registration is not correct<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

152
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:47,909
these are our results so for the

153
00:06:45,299 --> 00:06:49,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">left-hand blood we have the how many the</font>

154
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:52,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">percentage of the asus that passed the</font>

155
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:54,659
polish based test so for I do have that

156
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,759
eighty percent of the edge past the

157
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:59,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">polls based test for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a debate</font>

158
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,959
seventy-seven percent for APNIC is

159
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,239
eighty-four percent and for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of</font>

160
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">seventy-two percent here we note that</font>

161
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:07,018
there are some requirements for our

162
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,209
approach sugar correctly in most of the

163
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:12,329
cases the requirements are meant but

164
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:14,669
there are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> few AES is what which in</font>

correctly policy we find them as

167
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:23,219
incorrect now when we also add the BJP

168
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:25,619
test to check if the policies press the

169
00:07:23,219 --> 00:07:27,869
percentages<font color="#CCCCCC"> dropped dramatically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

170
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:30,989
we have thirty four percent of the a sin

171

right that all so far that<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> press in</font>

174
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:41,459
Nick and fourteen percent for the rest

175
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,789
and also remember that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our streets our</font>

176
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:47,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">tests are very strict so if no matter if</font>

na is register<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thousand peers if it</font>

178
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:52,948
misses one feeling the BJP<font color="#E5E5E5"> then consider</font>

179
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:55,079
these to contain not valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy so</font>

180
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,809
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a snapshot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our web-based</font>

181
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:00,899
interface so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the group or the</font>

182
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:03,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">RPS cell source code based in the AES</font>

183
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:05,879
and in the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> tab you can see this</font>

184
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:08,009
you know you can have links for the

185
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,719
source code so you can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> and click them</font>

186
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:12,179
and find out what is the source code

00:08:09,719 --> 00:08:15,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">interfacial format the next up the</font>

external warnings are what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES</font>

189
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:19,619
registered versus what its<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbors</font>

190
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,599
register so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you register</font>

191
00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:24,029
a link that it doesn't exist we put it

192
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,589
there then we have the internal warnings

193
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:27,659
you export something that we don't know

194
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:31,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">from where you import it so we also have</font>

the link level policy we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

the important the exports so our

199

conclusions so to the best of our

200
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,379
knowledge this is the first effort to

quantify the consistency of fire are we

202
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:51,030
find out the drive is the best register

203
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,250
overall with over 2,000
