oh thank Christopher for sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,470
stealing my thunder a little bit because

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,630
what I'm what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up</font>

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,690
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is what Boston University</font>

5
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:15,360
is done on the wired side so I think

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,840
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully it'll lead one to the</font>

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">other pretty well and this is going to</font>

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,109
be sort of a practical talk just like

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,330
the one before it about dealing with

10
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:27,330
worms and viruses and in particular

11
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,089
blaster from and how we dealt with

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,528
blaster last fall although sort of

13
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,360
config examples and some of the more

14
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,219
details I didn't don't have in the talk

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,269
today it's in some of the URLs which

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:41,760
I've got at the at the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> America theor</font>

private university in downtown Boston to

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,030
give you some idea of our scale we've

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,920
got you know 17,000 undergraduates and

22
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:57,539
11,000 graduate students all with

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:00,510
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I find is that sometimes</font>

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,578
we're an enterprise and sometimes we're

26
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,080
an ISP so sometimes our solutions go one

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,430
way and sometimes they go the other and

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,080
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't work at all because</font>

we're really either and as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,280
there are a lot of giants and our

00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:19,470
industry in the audience to talk about

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">solutions that I think at times I wonder</font>

who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of a average skill</font>

39
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:35,159
also want to point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not a</font>

41
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,659
people have done some of the things that

<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to talk about just snooping</font>

44

have implications for SaaS and a UPS

45
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,229
also we're going to talk about requiring

46
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:51,780
certain levels of certain patch levels

47
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,200
and such that can go against certain

48
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,969
contractual obligations you might have

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,439
we also sort of mandate that you install

50
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,000
certain cleaning software from time to

51
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,979
time and I'm sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get some</font>

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,829
always talk to your lawyers just to give

you an idea be used just like it to any

00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,180
got a gigabit core give it back bone

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,610
and then we run 10 megabit Ethernet to

59
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,740
all of our students so if we've got

12,000 students with 12,000 systems in

weekend in the fall where everybody

shows up and it typically starts on a

<font color="#E5E5E5">Friday and classes start on Tuesday so</font>

of shut their dorms down to give you an

dorms were vulnerable to blaster and

104
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,000
what we found is when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually ran</font>

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,560
them through our system about one out of

every three computers that plugged into

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network we when we scan them we</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4,000 systems that we had three</font>

couple weeks to do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> we needed a</font>

willing to accept anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wasn't a</font>

00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,850
silver bullet we were really looking for

something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the problem manageable</font>

completely this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the set of</font>

things that we used a network

the scanning some rapper scripts and

00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,919
some free downloads to do the cleaning

130
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,510
when we did find infected machines and

131
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,609
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as sort of two later procedural</font>

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,550
things which are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really more tied to</font>

133
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,560
closing the loop for what do we do after

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,240
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> students are there on the network</font>

135
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,580
and then we catch them later being

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,960
infected and that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with our</font>

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,719
sort of closing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the loop with</font>

00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:31,420
does and for some of you are more

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,609
curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> about our registration system</font>

190
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:35,960
the the usage policy for registration is

00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,160
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much saying that you're the owner</font>

responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the machines actions</font>

194
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:45,050
and that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get around a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

195
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:46,790
well Bob registered my machine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really my machine it's really his</font>

their machine if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you register a system</font>

199
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,690
you're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it so as I said</font>

200
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,000
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of components to the</font>

201
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,000
registration system it uses dns and dhcp

202
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,200
tricks in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular case we have a</font>

203
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:11,060
my SQL backend and and an apache web

204
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:14,510
server this is a really really lame

205
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:16,670
version of our network the first time a

206
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,909
student plugs their machine in it makes

207
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:21,320
a DHCP server request the first time

208
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,450
obviously the server doesn't know their

209
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:26,780
mac address so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time through</font>

210
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:28,539
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system allocates them an address</font>

211
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,510
from our private address pool that's

212
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:34,750
unique for their particular subnet they

213
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,630
then for example open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web browser</font>

214
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:41,030
type in yahoo or CNN or whatever ebay or

215
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,760
whatever your favorite website is and it

216
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:46,430
makes a request to the dns server the

217
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,140
dns server set with with multi views

218
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:50,239
such that when they see requests from

219
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,160
these private addresses it always

220
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,110
returns the IP address of our

221
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:58,129
stration system and that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way we</font>

222
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,810
capture students it falls<font color="#E5E5E5"> down a little</font>

223
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:02,600
bit if there's a device that doesn't

224
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,008
have a web browser but people<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to</font>

225
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,019
when things<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't work open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a web</font>

00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:09,970
browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end and so we end up</font>

227
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:12,800
dragging them into this web portal

228
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:15,319

<font color="#CCCCCC">anything that comes in that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asking</font>

redirected to the network registration

233

page so that even though it's getting

234
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,620
requests for things like CNN and eBay

235

238
00:09:34,389 --> 00:09:38,120
vulnerability server it tells the

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,670
vulnerability server which I'll talk

240
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,550
about in a second is this guy okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

241
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:46,189
let on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network one of two things</font>

242
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:49,069
happens the vulnerability server either

243
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:52,250
comes back and says yeah sure this guy

244
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:55,370
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine or know that no they don't</font>

245
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,100
and when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> no comes back we try to</font>

246
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,519
capture why what's the vulnerability

247
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:03,649
that this person failed when they fail

248
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,029
their sort of stopped at this point we

249
00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:08,300
actually display a page that says you

250
00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:11,269
failed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> security reason this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is why</font>

251
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,160
and click here<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a self-help tool and</font>

252
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:16,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll get to the self-help tool at the</font>

253
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,319
end the self-help tool is key for us

254
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,939
because once they're sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trapped in</font>

255
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:22,670
this state they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of it</font>

256
00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:24,709
and so the process at that point is they

257
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,209
download this help self-help tool it

258
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:27,579
runs through their system it cleans them

259
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,829
up it patches them it gets them going

260
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:31,849
brings them back through the same

261
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:34,279
registration process that I just walked

262
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:36,680
through when they get scanned again now

263
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:38,449
that they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all patched and clean they</font>

264
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">pass the vulnerability test and they can</font>

265
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:45,139
move on their way at the end of course

266
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,609
after their registered they reboot their

267
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:48,620
machine they go through this whole

268
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">process again they go to the dhcp server</font>

269
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,149
this time they're known because they're

270
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,300
registered they get a valid public

271
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,920
address they do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS lookup that DNS</font>

272
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,508
lookup returns the correct IP for

whatever it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

275
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,530

282
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:23,340
when their lease runs out or if we

283
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:26,010
manually flip their port off and on to

284

force them to read<font color="#E5E5E5"> eh CP they get nacked</font>

299
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:07,829
on two tools one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> nessus which is a</font>

300
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,290
free vulnerability scanner there are two

301
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:12,690
modes to this probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more common</font>

302
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:14,790
mode is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> client-server mode in this</font>

303
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,190
mode you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a client which you fire up</font>

304
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,990
it's got a configuration file typically

305
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,200
you feed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a list of hosts a subject</font>

306
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:25,260
range or a block of addresses and a list

307
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,400
of scans to do it goes it talks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

308
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,439

311
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">all of those addresses that then can do</font>

312
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,020
things with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this model</font>

313
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">is we're always scanning one IP in our</font>

314
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,910
registration system so there was a large

315
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of overhead we had to fire up the</font>

316
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,469
script<font color="#CCCCCC"> its read in its config file it</font>

317
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,180
was really bulky and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

318
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:53,250
was really doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number on our web</font>

319
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:55,589
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU so we moved to an S</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> escape</font>

320
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,210
ting language which had<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice benefit</font>

321
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,550
of actually doing the vulnerability scan

322
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,320
itself it fires up it hits one address

323
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,260
it comes back with a thumb up or thumb

324
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,030
down which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really all we needed the</font>

325
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:09,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">drawback though is it can only do one</font>

326
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:11,220
scan so in our case we were stuck last

327
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,950
fall with<font color="#E5E5E5"> only being able to scan for</font>

328
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,209
one particular vulnerability we look for

329
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:20,769
blaster<font color="#E5E5E5"> and blaster two or</font>

330
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:22,199
Oh 26 no 39 my our security guys tell us

331
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:24,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to do both</font>

332
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:27,099
to have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of scanning for</font>

333
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:32,699
multiple things as well as not having to

334
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:34,959
run the heavyweight client this works

335
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:36,459
sort of as I described it before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go</font>

336
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,949
to the website as part of your

337
00:13:36,459 --> 00:13:41,170
registration you click on a URL it's a

338
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:42,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">CGI that fires off the script in the</font>

339
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:45,429
client-server model it calls the server

340
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:47,349
to do a scan in the scripting language

341
00:13:45,429 --> 00:13:48,850
version the server itself does the scan

342
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,470
and it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back with a thumb up or</font>

343
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,269
thumb down as to whether whether you're

344
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,069
vulnerable or not if you're not

345
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:57,610
obviously you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on the net if you are</font>

346
00:13:54,069 --> 00:14:02,979
vulnerable<font color="#E5E5E5"> then then you brought to a</font>

347
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:04,470
cleaning tool now this tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> was actually</font>

348
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,059
originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> developed for our help desk</font>

349
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,800
it actually was already sitting around

350
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:12,129
as one of the tools in our arsenal when

351
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,170
we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> along last fall it was</font>

352
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:18,579
originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the 2000</font>

353
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:21,128
XP type machines it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> written it's</font>

354
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:23,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a rapper so it's just a script of</font>

355
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:26,319
it's an SMS script wrapped around

356
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,059
several different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

357
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:30,399
install it it puts itself into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the run</font>

358
00:14:28,059 --> 00:14:32,049
once so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when the machine gets</font>

359
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,600
rebooted it would run again and it

360
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:37,629
constantly updates itself in terms of

361
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,369
the where it is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registry it runs</font>

362
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:41,139
through a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of checks sequentially</font>

363
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:43,929
first thing it does is it verifies a

364
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:45,850
minimum set of service packs so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

365
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:48,249
particular case we required that<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

366
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,189
service pack 5 that when 2k systems we

367
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:54,459
had server service pack 2 that XP be at

368
00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:57,240
service pack 1 and I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

369
00:14:54,459 --> 00:15:00,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">a service pack check for the 2003</font>

370
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,649
systems that came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you fail bat</font>

371
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:04,899
then the script would use<font color="#E5E5E5"> W get to</font>

372
00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:07,869
download<font color="#E5E5E5"> the patch and install it for</font>

373
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:09,490
you it would check for example to make

374
00:15:07,869 --> 00:15:12,040
sure that you had certain hot fixes like

375
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,689
the blaster ones if you didn't have them

376
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:18,279
it would use<font color="#E5E5E5"> W get to install them and</font>

377
00:15:13,689 --> 00:15:20,110
for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would also run in the</font>

378
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:22,689
background there was a lot of fear

379
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:25,540
within IT that people would just say

380
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:26,919
screw this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kill it and then try to</font>

381
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,140
register again obviously they wouldn't

382
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to do that because</font>

383
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,530
they would fail our vulnerability test

384
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,640
again so we ran this actually in the

385
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,310
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> with just a little notice</font>

386
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,080
window that says oh please wait we're

387
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,380
looking at your system these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

388
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">would get installed in the background</font>

389
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,990
obviously if with service pack 2 10

390
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:46,050
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> reboot that was the key with the</font>

391
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:48,090
run ones when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you reboot runs the tool</font>

392
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:50,910
again the tool notes that it's it's past

393
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:53,520
the service pack check part runs<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotfix</font>

394
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,079
if you have to reboot after hotfix it's

395
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,569
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> run once it reboots puts itself</font>

396
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:00,240
back into the run once passes those two

397
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:03,360
tests it then we ran the Stinger

398
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,370
cleaning tool so that catches about 20

399
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,810
or odd viruses and such<font color="#E5E5E5"> this wasn't a</font>

400
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,370
catch-all for everything but it worked

401
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,130
relatively well for the particular

402
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:17,130
things that we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

403
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">found well chill we ran fix well Jeff</font>

404
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,030
and then as I said that there's a

405
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:22,589
quarantine a process where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would sort</font>

406
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of manually dump you off the network in</font>

407
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:26,580
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases there was actually result</font>

408
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,960
email that sent back to IT to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

409
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,080
is the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the user they're</font>

410
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,250
all clean we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on instead of</font>

411
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,520
sending an email at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

412
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,170
process to having it automatically go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

413
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,670
a web<font color="#CCCCCC"> page that automatically puts you</font>

414
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,439
out of the quarantine and back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

415
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:42,180
network that's still sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

416
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,470
tested right now there's no sort of

417
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical reason why we can't</font>

418
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,610
automatically bring people out of

419
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,730
quarantines just we didn't have time and

420
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">August to implement it we also pop up</font>

421
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:55,200
some things at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end which are do</font>

422
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,030
things like do you want us to set up

423
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,100
windows<font color="#E5E5E5"> update for you oh by the way</font>

430
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:17,550

00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,170
clean them they go on their merry way

432
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,819
but if another vulnerability comes out

433
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,230
there already registered and on the

the opposite of the way a normal

the service packs this is obviously

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">invasive so how did we do it was ninety</font>

00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:09,389
percent effective during the

480
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,889

481
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:16,169
ninety percent effective we had 400 or

482
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,450
so machines that we found after the

483
00:19:16,169 --> 00:19:20,460
registration process on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network that</font>

484
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:23,070
were still vulnerable or had some sort

485
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,200
of virus on them so that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400 down</font>

486
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,480
from the 12,000 that came through the

487
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,480
registration system so this effective

488
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,220
numbers really kind of a low low end

489
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,440
mark it's really how effective we were

490
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,150
at catching the ones that we thought

491
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,610
were vulnerable again we thought only

492
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:41,070
4,000 would be vulnerable we caught all

493
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,080
but four hundred of them after running

494
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,490
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400 through our quarantine process</font>

495
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,500
we're again were ninety percent

496
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,120
effective there wasn't only about 40 or

497
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that didn't make it out of that court</font>

498
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:52,530
that somehow passed through the

499
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,140
quarantine e process so sort of with

500
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:57,090
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-time registration system and</font>

501

a one pass through with quarantine we've

00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,459
taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve thousand computers and</font>

503
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,550
brought it down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 40 which is</font>

504
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:07,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely a manageable number no one</font>

505
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,120
ended up being trapped in the system we

506
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:13,440
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really ever catch anyone who</font>

507

couldn't couldn't progress the obvious

examples of people who couldn't progress

509
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,810
for things like I have an illegal

510

windows XP key I can't install my

511

512
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,850
that a trap of the registration system

513
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:29,040
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much as someone trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

514
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:31,889
something that's illegal so we so take

515
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,510
that however<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will whether it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

517
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:39,560

00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:41,580
that the infections weren't spreading

519
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:44,370
when the computers were plugged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and came through the</font>

522
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,120
network they weren't then vulnerable so

523
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,010
we didn't find an escalating population

524
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,110
of machines that was getting worse and

525

worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> and worse by the hour rather the</font>

machines came in they were or were not
