you're definitely looking at one right

147
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,750
now routers did it exists for a long

started<font color="#CCCCCC"> building multi-protocol routers</font>

163
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,599
because they saw that that bridges

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,849
weren't able to you know live up to the

165
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,800
task of doing all these different things

166
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:37,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">so they picked the largest set of</font>

167
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,539
popular protocols and they switched all

those protocols at the network layer but

169
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:44,259
then against due to the commercial

success and the ease of use of bridges

protein<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Cisco as router companies</font>

172
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,530
from their heritage felt that they

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,360
needed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do bridging as well and then</font>

174
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:54,820
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> started seeing these devices which</font>

175
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,160
were called hybrid routers or Browder's

176
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,050
which actually did bridging and routing

177
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,000
depending you know you could you could

178
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">bridge for lat and you could route for</font>

IP and if you want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do</font>

concurrent bridging and routing you

181
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:08,258
could actually do it for the same

182
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,710
protocol so these devices are getting

183
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,840
pretty complex routers were better than

bridges<font color="#E5E5E5"> and these sort of attributes</font>

185
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,429
routers dealt with unlike media much

easier don't forget in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mid 80s to</font>

topologies you could have lots of loops

196

lots of cycles in the graph and they

dealt with inner organizational

they could build cheaper price per port

was an order of magnitude cheaper I

213
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,780
don't know why it was that way just

turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be that way routers could</font>

have built routers really cheap but it

217
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,520
just didn't turn out that

00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,260
way people like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bridget's because they</font>

219
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,939
had little configuration since

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,460
everything was done at the mac layer you

221
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,380
didn't have to configure subnets or or

222
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,360
aggregation or anything like that the

<font color="#E5E5E5">MAC addresses were always factory</font>

224
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,210
installed in all the devices and you

225
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:45,670
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just learn them in during the data</font>

226
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,780
plane and do the right forwarding and a

227
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:52,540
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you had to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:53,800
neck<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the definition of</font>

229
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,300
an expert is if you have to do anything

230
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:58,839
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug the power in you have to</font>

231
00:08:55,300 --> 00:09:01,030
be an expert so a lot more bridge

232
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:02,680
vendors and router vendors and that and

233
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,770
that caused the price purport to be

234
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,270
driven down even more so so we have

235
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:09,430
three interesting battles that happen

236
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:10,750
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time frame which data link</font>

237
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,120
was going to win is it going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

238
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,760
Ethernet or token ring and in the wide

239
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,560
area is it going to be ATM or pause you

240
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,170
heard john curran say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning that</font>

241
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:22,150
the best way to connect a router to a

242
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,250
network is to connect it directly to the

243
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,620
fiber nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the router and the</font>

244
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,900
fiber is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cost most cost efficient</font>

245
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,670
way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing things so we'll see who won</font>

246
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,110
there and then what device type do you

247
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,380
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> use routers or should you use</font>

248
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,000
bridges so the Battle of Ethernet versus

249
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,640
token ring existed for nearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically IBM against</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dec it</font>

251
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,480
was really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there was also these</font>

252
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,850
you know that this public domain set of

<font color="#E5E5E5">people that was running tcp/ip that tend</font>

to like Ethernet as well workstation

259
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,160
who won is pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious that ethernet</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">one and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet now they're building</font>

00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:14,079
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty amazing the battle for ATM</font>

vs. paws existed for about five years i

277
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,469
ATM did make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

278
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,329
to the core it was a it was a nice way

279
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,970
of connecting routers together because

280
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,709
there was a point where ds3 was just not

00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough people needed more bandwidth and</font>

pause really<font color="#CCCCCC"> won again for simplicity</font>

295
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,760
it's amazing how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> the KISS principle</font>

296

can take you and now the nowadays

297
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,240
there's more chip vendors doing pausing

298
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,360
ATM because they see the current going

299
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,190
in the opposite direction and it is an

300
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,230
amazing today we can use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font>

306
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:54,449
type of devices should we use routers or

307
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,270
bridges well the old adages bridge where

308
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,370
you can route where you must bridges are

309
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,779
good for workgroups and if you don't

310
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:02,640
have too many bridge hops you won't get

311
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,050
into trouble because once you have a lot

312
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,790
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> redundancy then you have to deal with</font>

313
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,439
spanning tree and if you want to build

localize your subnets and route

everywhere else just use them as a

concentration points of hosts and let's

335
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,849
face it switches really got popular

on a land on a shared media collisions

339
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,350
would give you effectively thirty

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,459
well I think routers will never lose

346
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,759
they've been around for 25 years if not

longer bridges<font color="#CCCCCC"> are commercial success</font>

348
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:26,009
through this the ethernet ubiquity the

<font color="#E5E5E5">simplicity of Ethernet cause switches to</font>

351
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,490
plug and play and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's still that that</font>

352
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,930
goes along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the KISS principle as</font>

353
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:39,000
well so the communication model this is

354
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:41,849
always fun this went on for so many

355
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,079
years datagrams<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus connections is it</font>

356
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,720
better to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection oriented</font>

357
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:49,138
network or a packet network or a

358
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,480
connectionless network with less state

359
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:53,910
there was always these terms about hard

360
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,339
state versus soft state where TCP has

361
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,079
hard state but IP has soft<font color="#E5E5E5"> state well on</font>

362
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:59,939
my point of view me as a software

363
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,199
developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to do a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mallick in both</font>

364
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:06,449
cases so it's pretty hard to me so some

365
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:10,349
of the connection oriented protocols

366
00:14:06,449 --> 00:14:12,120
were like<font color="#CCCCCC"> x.25 SNA ATM frame relay these</font>

367
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,509
were all using connection oriented

00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,310
protocols or quote hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> state below the</font>

369
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:19,230
network layer and then the various

370
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,138
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network layer protocols like I p x 10's</font>

372
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:26,459
connections at the transport layer were

373
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:29,399
meant to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> end to end and not between</font>

374
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,779
devices in a network and the packets

375
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,269
that were sent between the network were

376
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:35,939
actually datagrams or or connectionless

377
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:38,910
entities and then each packet would have

378
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:40,649
its own address ability and you could be

379
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:42,600
able to rear out faster everything data

grams is you know motherhood and apple

381
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,000

382

connections well SNA was a proprietary

392

protocol so one company can control the

393
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,479
technology and they felt that

394
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,310

<font color="#CCCCCC">the same so maybe it's a mood argument</font>

00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,480
or a subtle argument so who won

was the data grams

let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into communication modes</font>

500
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:25,840
there's two parte communication which

501
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:28,570
the most popular form<font color="#E5E5E5"> of communication</font>

502
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,220
point-to-point there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the many many</font>

503
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:32,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">to many few too many that's all the</font>

504
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,210
multi-point mode and then there's this

505
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,850
closest parte communication let me get

506
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the closest server also known as any</font>

507
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">caste which we've exploited really only</font>

508
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,780
in the last I'd say five to seven years

509
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,649
in IP and trying to formalize it in ipv6

510
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,960
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course all parte communication is</font>

511
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:51,520
broadcast how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

512
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,230
have tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send a packet to everybody</font>

513
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the internet and why would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and why is that useful so</font>

515
00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:02,169
within a reasonable scope is broadcast

516
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:04,780
useful so layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> two Datagram protocols</font>

517
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:07,210
could do unicast multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> anycast in</font>

518
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,840
broadcast the land itself worked really

519
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:12,070
well and it was a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> passive type</font>

520
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,360
multi-party communication model because

521
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:15,399
you would just program your land

522
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,809
controller and then the land controller

523
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,550
would just listen on the wire for those

524
00:20:16,809 --> 00:20:19,750
addresses you didn't have to go tell

525
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,559
somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> you wanted to listen to</font>

526
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:26,910
something outside the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

527
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:30,309
connection protocols could only do

528
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:32,500
unicast and multicast like ATM could had

529
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:34,030
some form of doing multi-point VCS but

530
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,730
it was a switch V scene you'd have to

531
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:38,230
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up ahead of time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really when</font>

532
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:41,700
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running in PVC mode you had to</font>

533
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,470
simulate this multi-point sort of

534
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,000
communication by doing replication over

535
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:50,020
the same physical link and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not</font>

536
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,250
good for bandwidth savings so it was

537
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">really only the network players that</font>

538
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,490
could really support all these really

539
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">different modes in a robust and scalable</font>

540
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,420
way everybody will claim<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font>

541
00:20:56,410 --> 00:21:01,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">support it but in a robust and scalable</font>

542
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:03,490
way mostly the network layer protocols

543
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:05,470
could do it and not all network layer

544
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,900
protocols could do it and if you look at

545
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">that list right there x 10's had</font>

546
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:11,730
point-to-point communication but only

547
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,050
really had linked local broadcast and

548
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:16,230
deck had point-to-point link local

549
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,760
multicast and<font color="#CCCCCC"> link local broadcast an</font>

550
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:21,610
apple talk was really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one that</font>

551
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,679
really went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop multicast</font>

552
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,050
early on they had broadcast and

553
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,850
multicast applications because of the

554
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:30,280
type of applications and the ease of use

555
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,309
they wanted to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the user but</font>

556
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,399
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at everything</font>

557
00:21:31,309 --> 00:21:36,049
together really IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ipv6 have all the</font>

558
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:38,330
communication modes and they've been

559
00:21:36,049 --> 00:21:40,460
studied and experimented and are<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

560
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:44,749
the more robust and scalable way of

561
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:46,279
going so for most support who won well

562
00:21:44,749 --> 00:21:48,919
like I said appletalk really had the

563
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:52,669
applications to back the multicast mode

564
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:55,100
the chooser the directory services print

565

sharing file sharing all that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

566
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,759
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give Apple credit that they they</font>

567
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,700
were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy that stuff much</font>

568
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:03,950
earlier than IP did but I p learned from

569
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:06,080
that and use<font color="#E5E5E5"> those sort of things a lot</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP came from Apple</font>

with more experimentation and deployment

it was in the small community of

00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:43,910
sky is following we better do something

713
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:46,620
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> away when was this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soo in 95 94 95</font>

714
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,450
96<font color="#E5E5E5"> timeframe well we're still here and</font>

715
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,520
and i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network is as good as</font>

716
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,890
it's ever gotten I mean what other

717
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:56,910
network could move<font color="#E5E5E5"> around as much spam</font>

718
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:59,390
as we have how do we solve the ipv4

719
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,530
problem well there was a interesting

720
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:02,970
committee I think Paul will talk a

721
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit about this but there was this</font>

722
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,940
committee called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Road routing and</font>

723
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,710
addressing there were a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

724
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got together to figure out how to</font>

725
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:12,760
do some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ellen that was a</font>

726
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,370
like way of solving the problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

727
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:18,340
pay was a way of<font color="#CCCCCC"> putting encapsulation</font>

728
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:20,050
into an IP and using another level of 32

729
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:22,300
bit of dressing the same 32-bit

730
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:23,830
addressing that we do use today but it

731
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:28,240
was on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

732
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:29,830
the users 32-bit headers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was one</font>

733
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,890
way OSI was also considered as a

734
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,270
replacement to ipv4 again and then those

735
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:36,880
were the various proposals on their

736
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:39,940
knees hip hip catnip tuba Nimrod and Big

737
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,850
Ten Big Ten was a was probably the

738
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,230
protocol that had the most could have

739
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,850
had the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> success in the shortest</font>

740
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:47,740
amount of development time basically a

741
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:50,530
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people got together at I</font>

742
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:52,870
airport close to o'hare got to get it

743
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,000
together at a hotel close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to o'hare</font>

744
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">airport just to come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a scheme</font>

745
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,300
and at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it was an argument</font>

746
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:01,120
between variable length addresses in

747
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:03,040
fixed length addresses so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

748
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,350
is sip was a proposal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bite</font>

749
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:07,300
addresses and so based on the influence

750
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:10,540
from Big Ten it was obvious that eight

751
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:12,340
was too small and variable length wasn't

752
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,080
going to happen so the compromise by

753
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:16,360
committee was let's have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16 byte</font>

754
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:20,500
addresses and that's how IP version 6

755
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:23,169
was born and there was more merchandise

756
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">to became available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tese actually what</font>

757
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:27,220
tube stands for his<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and UDP with</font>

758
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,840
bigger addresses this is a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could</font>

759
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,270
run all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet applications and</font>

760
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">TCP and UDP over a new network layer and</font>

761
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,920
its associated protocols and that was

762
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,290
going to be seal and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ass is to IOUs EST</font>

763
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,840
is and all those protocols and funny

764
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:47,950
highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> I is is a very popular protocol</font>

765
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:50,050
today what's good about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv6 well</font>

766
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,300
there's no ad hoc standards anymore a

767
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:54,730
lot of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ARP was specified</font>

768
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,620
because the they looked at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> C code</font>

769
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:58,240
and then translated into English those

770
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,760
sort of things aren't happening in ipv6

771
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:06,010
it's really more of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard base it's</font>

772
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,870
kind of merging OSI and and and ietf and

773
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:14,080
using the best of both worlds or the

774
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:15,459
worst of<font color="#E5E5E5"> both both worlds so so it was</font>

775
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,340
designed both by her host and router

776
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:21,099
vendors and like the ITF way was built

777
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:22,820
through implementation

778
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:25,609
okay we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say what's bad</font>

779
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,379
about IP ipv6 so I'm like severely

780
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:30,619
behind and everybody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear about</font>

781
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:34,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">I GPS okay so let's go to routing</font>

782
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:37,218
protocols real quick now what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

783
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:39,198
the plethora of routing protocols did we

784
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:41,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">have too many that we learn from our</font>

785
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:43,369
past sins well we started with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ray okay</font>

786
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,109
this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the nutshell of</font>

787
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:49,279
everything we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with rip and EGP</font>

788
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:50,718
that defined the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP EGP split we needed</font>

789
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,459
two protocols one that runs in the

790
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:54,440
domain one that runs between domains

791
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:55,519
everybody like trip because it was easy

792
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,089
to understand you could do route

793
00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:01,099
filtering ggp and EGP were the inter a

794
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:03,349
as protocols that were run in the early

795
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:07,418
days of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mill net in the ARPANET okay</font>

796
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:12,439
bgp was a successor of these protocols

797
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:14,509
okay this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rip EGP couple they</font>

798
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,269
ran for a long time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of vendors</font>

799
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:19,969
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco thought that that wasn't</font>

800
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:22,009
sufficient had to provide a proprietary

801
00:31:19,969 --> 00:31:26,119
solution to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> katie was the public</font>

802
00:31:22,009 --> 00:31:28,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">domain version of it proteon came out</font>

803
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:32,718
with ospf and high<font color="#E5E5E5"> etf was working on</font>

804
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:35,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp who's going to talk about bgp there</font>

805
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:37,219
was a war between is Dyson ospf bottom

806
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,928
line is enterprise runs almost PF

807
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:40,699
service providers when I is the ayahs

808
00:31:38,929 --> 00:31:44,509
and I could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in the bar</font>

809
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:46,579
tonight why that was useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this was</font>

810
00:31:44,509 --> 00:31:50,419
the first set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendors that</font>

811
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:56,089
implemented ospf<font color="#CCCCCC"> sues going to talk</font>

812
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:58,909
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP even though ospf ania</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sites</font>

813
00:31:56,089 --> 00:32:00,229
were becoming deployed the router

814
00:31:58,909 --> 00:32:02,239
vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was still a</font>

815
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:04,549
need for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own protocols and so</font>

816
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:09,829
Cisco is working on eigrp<font color="#CCCCCC"> novell was</font>

817
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:12,529
working on mlsp but<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally what</font>

818
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:14,869
happened in the late 90s is more I GOP

819
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:16,669
networks move to ospf and today we can

820
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:19,339
say we really have three protocols that

821
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:21,319
are running and they're very mature

822
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:25,539
implementations from dozens of vendors

823
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:29,019
and that's all SPF is<font color="#E5E5E5"> tyas and bgp</font>

824
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:29,019
definitely no mention

825
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:34,129
you did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay can I do my last slide</font>

826
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:44,670
so it as a software developer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font>

00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:47,460
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is succeeding because</font>
