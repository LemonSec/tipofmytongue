remember there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of skepticism</font>

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,509
about at the time about why this should

have happened or what the cause was

8
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,640
since BGP is supposed to be immune to to

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">looked and looked and looked at BGP data</font>

26
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:56,519
for a long long time and nothing

27
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,699
interesting ever happened until January

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,199
2003 of course stuff was happening but

29
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,319
nothing interesting from a global

30
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,149
perspective until January 2003 when the

31
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,889
slammer worm I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> along and I think</font>

32
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put to rest any notion that</font>

33
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">there there anywhere any doubt that</font>

34
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was a relationship between</font>

35
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,630

36
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:20,580
started look at the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I wanted</font>

37
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">some way to compare</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to previous worm</font>

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,920
yardstick there was no standard

41
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,229
measurement for me for which to measure

42
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:37,110
these things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what I came here</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about today he's down</font>

44
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,060
so everyone has their metrics measure of

45
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,350
measures and indicators in in biology we

46
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,790
talk about vital signs like blood

looking at our instability and reach

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:09,859
ability instability could be based on

116
00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Route flapping or it could be based on</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time density of rude announcements</font>

and withdrawals just looking at updates

119
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:18,380
per minute reach ability can be based on

00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">tiles table sizes measured in the total</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">130,000 these days or it could be</font>

of IP addresses in a particular table

126
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,150
methods and I'll try to touch on that so

127
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,440
after the slammer worm I tried to come

128
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,989
up with some kind of metric that I could

129
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:42,320
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to standardize and measure these</font>

130
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:46,330
things so given<font color="#E5E5E5"> nbg peers and bgp peers</font>

131
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,680
i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP peering relationships a with</font>

132
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,539
10 different routers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> scattered</font>

133
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,210
across the globe topologically and

134
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:55,340
geographically<font color="#E5E5E5"> dispersed so for each</font>

135
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,930

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,510
a router now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a collector I'm an</font>

137
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,919
observer for each one of these peers I

138
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:02,419
want to calculate the local weighting

139
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,280
factor that tells me<font color="#E5E5E5"> how active this</font>

140
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,409
local router is and so what I do there

141
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:09,609
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simply take the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hourly</font>

00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:18,320
thousand divided by that factor and that

146
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:20,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives me a pretty good number we call</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> w for each one of those weights</font>

148
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,698

151
00:05:28,159 --> 00:05:32,150
we use 15 minutes while I experimented

152
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,400
with it empirically<font color="#E5E5E5"> on data that we were</font>

153
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,010
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at over the course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of ordinary</font>

154
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,620
days and extremely active days and what

155
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,870
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find is that if you go 30 minutes</font>

156
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,550
you dampen out a lot of the the

157
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,860
transient stuff but you also get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

158
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,150
of time leg now it's 15 minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font>

159
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,820
anything is indicated because you're

160
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,349
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at medians and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could go</font>

161
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,340
smaller like 10 minutes or five minutes

162
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:55,010
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you're going to get a lot of</font>

163
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,289
false positives so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I chose a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 15 minute</font>

164
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:00,110
window because it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me to give me</font>

165
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:01,919
a pretty good compromise between false

166
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:07,200
positives

167
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:08,550
and I use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that value that</font>

168
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,050
medium value to calculate the local

169
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,460
instability index where the local and

170
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,810
stability index is just that weighting

171
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,830
factor they talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a thousand</font>

172
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,740
divided by the the hourly average x the

173
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:21,630
the median for updates and withdrawal

174
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,100
for the past 15 minutes that gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a</font>

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">local instability index for each one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

176
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">my peers and then I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just take the median</font>

177
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:31,890
of that so I started out just looking at

178
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:35,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as a way to to understand what was</font>

179
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:38,099
going on empirically what I found is

180
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,860
that values between 0 and 50 on this

181
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,630
scale that we developed we're pretty

182
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,950
much normal instability<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a daily basis</font>

183
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:46,320
you'll see your values go up and down

184
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,450
from 0 to 50 not indicating any

185
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,820
particular kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stress when you see</font>

186
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:52,920
values go from 50 to 100 you're talking

187
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:57,150
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> unstable conditions and values</font>

188
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:58,380
over 100 are very high instability you

189
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,239
know that something serious is going on

190
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,060
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the 15 minute window as i</font>

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,280
said the instability tends to lag by

192
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:09,930
about eight minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of significant</font>

193

00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:45,450
right off the chart and then drops down

213
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:59,940

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,919
not only the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> worst instability that</font>

215
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,950
we've ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen since we've looked at</font>

different data sets yields it's very

219
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,870
similar results so<font color="#CCCCCC"> when now we go back</font>

220
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,540
and we look at the code red instability

221
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:19,010
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> its worst day which was july nine</font>

222
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:21,860
2001 see that pic peaked around 160 you

223
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:23,360
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day started fairly normal and it</font>

224
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,220
was until after noontime eastern

225
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,870
standard time that the value started to

226
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:32,479
creep up until they peaked around 161

227
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:33,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">ninda very similarly stayed stayed</font>

228
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,770
pretty quiet in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the day</font>

00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,890
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then carrot uncharacteristically</font>

230
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,210
just shot up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 100 level right</font>

231
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,400
after looks like about eleven o'clock

232
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:47,480
eastern standard time on sep tember<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18th</font>

233
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,490
2001 so putting the three of the three

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:51,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad days on one slide so you can</font>

235
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,370
kind of get<font color="#CCCCCC"> from perspective you see the</font>

236
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,380
slammer worm is easily the winner of the

of global instability other events<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

239
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,950
just scanning worms that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause global</font>

morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> my beeper went off anybody guess</font>

246
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:24,980
why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your responsibility you guys</font>

247
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,810
did this to me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys were patching</font>

248
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:31,490
for the iOS vulnerability and basically

249
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,079
inducing massive amounts of global

250
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:34,370
instability so two o'clock<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

251
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,750
morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got on my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keyboard and wrote</font>

253
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:39,230
Security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said the internet is under</font>

254
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:41,650

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,650
you're an idiot

256
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,410
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> turns out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's pattern repeated</font>

257
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,120
itself or three days right after

258
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,769
midnight eastern standard time everybody

259
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,029
started taking down the routers and the

<font color="#E5E5E5">little piece if you look at it in more</font>

the top of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour which more or less</font>

263
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:01,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggests scheduled maintenance then so</font>

264
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,910
we were ready for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the killer</font>

been released the same day as the I

00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,620
think the iOS vulnerability in July

268
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,820
sixteenth and we SAT waited for the

killer one that was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come we</font>

were ready this time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the blaster one</font>

seeing my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile instability indicator</font>

284
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:43,959
go up and watching global<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach ability</font>

285
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,709
go down and there again I watched my

286
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:47,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">friends at the Homeland Security</font>

287
00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:50,109
Department and said something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

288
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:51,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I don't think it's a worm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and sure</font>

289
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,130
enough five minutes later we turned on

290
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:55,269
CNN found out it with the blackout if

291
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,010
you want more information on that

292
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:00,959
there's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good report on the</font>

293
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:04,630
Renesys website about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP effects on</font>

294
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,989
global routing excuse me the the the

295
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:11,620
global routing effects of the blackout

296
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:13,120
so I said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this reach ability was</font>

297
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,550
another area I'm sort of working towards

298
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,839
a global reach ability index as well

299
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:18,010
this shows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global reach ability</font>

300
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:19,600
index kind of looked like<font color="#E5E5E5"> during that</font>

301
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,790
two day period it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plummet and</font>

302
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,829
reach ability and here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just take the</font>

303
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,630
maximum table size for all the routers

304
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,040
that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at and I divide that by</font>

305
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,160
its current table size that's pretty

306
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,170
simple index and you can see that

307
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,170
basically three percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

308
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:36,579
disappeared at 4 11 p.m. eastern

309
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:40,209
standard time and then slowly came back

310
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:43,359
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the course of about 24 hours a very</font>

311
00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:45,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar profile basically happened</font>

312
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,899
during the slammer worm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case it</font>

313
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:48,160
was not quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> three percent of the</font>

314
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:49,500
internet that disappeared but it did

315
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,760
plumb it off<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty quickly after</font>

316
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,079
slammer worm start to disappear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font>

317
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,050
back slowly over the course of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

318
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:58,060
17 18

319
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,740
this chart is smooth because i pasted it

320
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,939
from a pitch that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was giving to</font>

321
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:07,890
executives and they can't handle

322
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">squiggly lines so here in summary</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

323
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:11,939
suggested that there are some beats and

324
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:14,320
metrics that can be derived from bgp

325
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,970
that we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about ways to</font>

326
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,200
standardize our vocabulary so that we're

327
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:19,600
all talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things in some</font>

328
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,250
standardized way not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that necessarily</font>

329
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,170
this is the only way to think about it

330
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm looking for feedback I'm here to</font>

331
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:29,279
suggest that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this and</font>

332
00:12:25,209 --> 00:12:32,680
if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any suggestions on this</font>

333
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,870
please write to me Dennis not McGrath

334
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:38,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dartmouth edu or condor at dartmouth</font>

335
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,430
edu there are other ways of looking at

336
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:40,899
internet health and we're also looking

337
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:43,390
at those and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at our net</font>

338
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,769
watch that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is TS dartmouth edu website</font>

339
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,209
and see some of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font>

340
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:49,089
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at including a packet</font>

343
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,640
mentioned earlier and finally we need

344
00:12:55,269 --> 00:13:00,459
data researchers always need data and we

345
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,449
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> have enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently the</font>

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,110
at I don't have a lot of real-time bgp

348

349

right now and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> great i actually</font>

350
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,040
get pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good numbers with those three</font>

351
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:15,579
edu feeds but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> also get a</font>

352
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,399
disproportionate contribution from

353
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:20,140
internet too and last week there was a

354
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,160
major instability event on internet too

355
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,560
and it sent my global<font color="#E5E5E5"> instability</font>

356
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,670
indicator haywire and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wrote to</font>

360
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:31,750
it turns out it was just a link between

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> abilene network in argentina and</font>

afterwards<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you one and that's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it questions for Dennis thank you</font>

372
00:13:56,259 --> 00:14:04,209
I had a question didn't have a question

373
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:06,059
then um you didn't see anything from the

374
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:07,988
blaster worm<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have an intuition of why</font>

375
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:12,549
why didn't I questions why didn't

376
00:14:07,989 --> 00:14:14,859
blaster worm cause instability it it it

377
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:17,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">appears that it didn't it didn't scan</font>

378
00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:18,970
nearly aggressively as his predecessors

379
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:20,350
obviously there was some some

380
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,600
instability there it was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of buried</font>

381
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,769
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> noise again you should talk to</font>

382
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,639
the guys at Renesys who look at this

383
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:29,350
data much more closely than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do well</font>

384
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,269
chia actually which I didn't show the

385
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,389
following week after the blaster were in

386
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:36,519
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> gia caused a little bit more</font>

387
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:37,989
instability than blaster did because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

388
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:40,529
had all that ping traffic that was going

389
00:14:37,989 --> 00:14:43,989
around as well but both those worms

390
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:45,069
didn't come near the the instability

391
00:14:43,989 --> 00:14:47,379
effects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that observe at the previous</font>

393
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:51,609
the firewall and I'm not an expert in

394
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:57,119
what blaster was doing or what it was

395
00:14:51,609 --> 00:14:59,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to do but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I certainly think that</font>

00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:00,730
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't seen the last of the very</font>

398
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:06,749
two particular ones we're not fast

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:06,748
movers the way slammer was thanks
