1
00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:04,859
in a fine tradition of me traveling the

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,619
world giving other people's

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:10,379
presentations Here I am again I'm

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:14,160
presenting<font color="#E5E5E5"> Garrett during work his</font>

5
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,440
global ipv6 routing table analysis so

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,119
none of this is my work and I happily

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">take your comments back to him and I</font>

8
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,850
answer them when I can so and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,590
slides have been modified from his

10
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,019
original version as you'll see in some

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,519
of the later slides and when the headers

12
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,668
get a little more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm</font>

13
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,320
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make you to let</font>

14
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:38,160
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's my doing and not</font>

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,079
his because you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of not</font>

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,059
keeping to the you know the theme of the

17
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,309
original slide so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

18
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,839
about what the global IV please be<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font>

19
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:52,739
routing table is some numbers and

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,170
pictures some recommendations and his

21
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,360
original slides so that you can compare

22
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">them with these are available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,000
URL and these another version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,949
will be available on the nanog site but

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">I doubt if the quotes quotes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Laden</font>

26
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:10,740
version will be available so what's the

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,880
global v6 routing table it's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,970
get when you connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,220
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp 4 plus plus and people are</font>

30
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:22,320
actually doing that actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

31
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:26,070
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room are doing v6 more</font>

32
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,139
than last time cool it's a mixture of

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,508
different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of address space</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone</font>

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,159
address space and the regional internet

35
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,470
registry address based like Aaron<font color="#CCCCCC"> ripe</font>

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">ap Nick lack Nick there's actually a new</font>

37
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,810
original registry there's some a SS that

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
still<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced only six phone space but</font>

39
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,040
as you'll see later the six<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonus is</font>

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,490
starting to decommission itself so some

41
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,079
of that will transition the network

42
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,530
infrastructure differs from region to

43
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:55,798
region and and the peering agreements

44
00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:00,299
are somewhat loose not like they are

45
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,950
with v4 so transits usually free which

46
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:05,579
creates some really interesting and

47
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,789
stabilities and lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SNS don't</font>

48
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:10,470
filter anything and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> unfortunate</font>

49
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:12,070
and there's still a lot of tunnels

50
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,120
there's a lot of problems with

51
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:16,100
actually one of those one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> k's</font>

52
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:21,670
diagrams of the tunnels would probably

53
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:24,799
be pretty cool so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty big</font>

54
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,929
over all of the different prefix lengths

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,150
and then if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the first three</font>

56
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,790
columns global rir space and six bones

57
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,490
space those in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> parentheses on the</font>

58
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:40,820
end or<font color="#CCCCCC"> what those numbers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were on 513</font>

59
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:42,380
2003 so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 99 September of 2003 is</font>

60
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,260
what's in the main part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the</font>

61
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:49,910
stuff in parenthesis is what it was in

62
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:53,090
may so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were you know 266 last 32 s</font>

63
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,280
and of those you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know 238 or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rir space</font>

64
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,670
and 28 or six phone space that sort of

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,380
thing so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can browse through this</font>

66
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:03,140
there are a lot of / 48 s being

67
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,790
advertised and some of the reason for

68
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,859
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is because you know yet</font>

69
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,170
again the multi homes solution isn't

70
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,600
here so people are doing the best they

71
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,829
can and advertising more specifics and

72
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,540
then there are a lot of pathologies that

73
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,670
we'll talk about later there are

74
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,799
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> some / 64 s in the global</font>

75
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:25,160
routing table which you know kind of

76
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:29,360
like / 32 s yay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the 624 address</font>

77
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:31,190
space there's several several companies

78
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,440
that era Mina organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP is</font>

79
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,730
announcing it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for</font>

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,980
more because it's sort of like in any

81
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,190
cast for six to four which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

82
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:43,220
translation address space and there's

83
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:46,579
some a guy you can contact if you want

84
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,859
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become a relay and there are actually</font>

85
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,280
more specifics being seen which is a big

86
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:54,140
no no i'm not a big 64 person but so i

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,590
can't really give you much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than</font>

88
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,440
that so the total number of prefixes

89
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,959
over the last 24 months is this so each

90
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,090
line on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a month and the</font>

91
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,890
number is on the y-axis so there are

92
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">these big spikes will talk about some of</font>

93
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">those later but it's increasing and</font>

94
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,840
there's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know 480 total</font>

95
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,899
I'll talk about that some more and this

96
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,599
is a breakdown<font color="#E5E5E5"> of of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR space</font>

97
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:23,270
versus this<font color="#E5E5E5"> six bone space so the six</font>

98
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:23,920
bone space is green and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR space is</font>

99
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,659
red

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,390
it's no surprise that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RIR space is</font>

101
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:30,130
getting bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you know they're</font>

102
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,570
starting to assign blocks and in the

103
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,219
beginning they warrant it was just six

104
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,840
phone so the six bones kind of going

105
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,700
down a little bit and I was kind of

106
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,500
going up no big surprise this is the the

107
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,630
prefixes in the last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> months I'm</font>

108
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,390
sorry three months one compared to the

109
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,760
other so the the red is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR space</font>

110
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,380
and the green is the six-month base and

111
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,240
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some really</font>

112
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,690
interesting little bleeps on here and

113
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:01,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll talk about those some more in a few</font>

114
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:05,410
minutes and this is again you know not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

115
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,030
huge surprise so back in what does it

116
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">look like almost a year ago maybe a</font>

117
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,510
little more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year ago the</font>

118
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,489
registries changed their policy so your

119
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:16,420
default your<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum allocation used to</font>

120
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,330
be a / 35 ounces / 32 so and there was a

121
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:22,630
trade-in program a trade up program for

122
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,810
the / 35 holders to get sloshed<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32s so</font>

123
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:28,030
the /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32 s or the green and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the / 35 of</font>

124
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,070
the red so it's no big surprise that the

125
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">32s are going up and the 35s are going</font>

126
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,780
down but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that</font>

127
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,220
still haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone back to get their new</font>

128
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:41,169
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> improved huge space because they</font>

129
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,230
probably don't need it so and you know

130
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:45,730
the summary of all of this there are

131
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,440
four hundred twenty nine blocks is

132
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,880
signed by the the regional registries

133
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,160
out of 2001 / 16 and this is the

134
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,880
breakdown so that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the main</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

135
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:00,520
like 76 is how it was in in September of

136
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,620
this year<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the 63 is what it was in</font>

137
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,380
may so Aaron's assign 76<font color="#CCCCCC"> ap 912 ripe as</font>

138
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,480
leading the leading the race with 238

139
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,020
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lack Nick the new registry is</font>

140
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:16,030
starting to assign some ripe actually

141
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,190
went back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> icon and got a new block of</font>

142
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,510
address space so they've used up their

143
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:21,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">first one and they went back to get</font>

144
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">another one and somebody actually got a</font>

145
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">/ 31 on in September which is a huge</font>

146
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,130
amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of address space so</font>

147
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,680
so let's see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more information</font>

148
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's out to micro allocations that</font>

149
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:44,820
have been happening for root servers

150
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:47,580
let's see what else there's a 371 total

151
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:49,409
unique prefix our<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s numbers so it's</font>

152
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,760
crawling from last time I don't remember

153
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:54,690
exactly what it was last time it was

154
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:57,570
quite a bit less let's see and this is a

155
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">breakdown of prefixes by region but</font>

156
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,900
these are regions from right because

157
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,480
garrett gives this talk at the right

158
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:05,609
meetings and he's in germany so like

159
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,220
there's the countries are up in the

160
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,530
corner that's a breakdown by country

161
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:13,350
basically in Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> French France and</font>

162
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:18,659
the Netherlands and such if you're

163
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:20,370
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this graph is I learned</font>

164
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,940
a lot when I had to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what this</font>

165
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:27,000
graph met at the bottom those are all

166
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:30,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the shortened version of each allocation</font>

167
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,050
that's given from I can to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> RI are ok</font>

168
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,300
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are the / 24 s and then the</font>

169
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:39,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">y-axis is the number of / 29 s out of</font>

170
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,580
that / 24 that are allocated so when you

171
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:44,280
get it when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR gives you a block of</font>

172
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:47,039
/ 32 they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> reserved it out of a</font>

173
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,469
/ 29 and the reservations are apparently

174
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,630
quite long lived so what Garrett is done

175
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,360
it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken it down by that since in</font>

176
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:56,760
essence when you get a / 32 the / 29 is

177
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,490
is you know used for all intents and

178
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:01,349
purposes so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> breakdown of and</font>

179
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically that you know that what you</font>

180
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:05,130
can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from this is that there's</font>

181
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,440
a lot more that have been allocated than

182
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,719
or in the routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> table and and the</font>

183
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,000
newer ones it's even more so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

184
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,040
are getting address space a long time in

185
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">advance of when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're advertising it</font>

186
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,300
unlike in v4 when you get a block<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

187
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,590
you needed it a week ago and you're

188
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,910
frantically trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it in the</font>

189
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,919
routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> table it doesn't seem to be</font>

190
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:29,190
occurring with these six not really sure

191
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:32,849
why so so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the</font>

192
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:34,380
changes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the titles of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk so</font>

193
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:38,329
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting things that</font>

194
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:40,519
are happening out on the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

195
00:08:38,328 --> 00:08:42,378
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost like things we've seen before</font>

196
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:46,819
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly like things we've seen</font>

197
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:49,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">before so again we have the it's all</font>

198
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:50,959
mine incident where an AS decided that

199
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,459
they were going to advertise everything

200
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,079
as /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32s and various things and and</font>

201
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">there and they're not Garrett's not</font>

202
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,649
really sure how they did this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

203
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,269
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> like redistributing a couple</font>

204
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,639
of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one protocol into another</font>

205
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:06,110
they would still only be re advertising

206
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,699
routes that actually existed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

207
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">routing table but there are routes that</font>

208
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:11,359
were never seen before or since this

209
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:14,209
incident and he's not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure how</font>

210
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:18,679
they did that but that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

211
00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:19,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">big spiky things in the graph let's see</font>

212
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,170
oh and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

213
00:09:19,939 --> 00:09:23,209
interesting thing about this is there

214
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,809
were two uniquely independent autonomous

215
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:29,569
systems using a s 1654 which of course

216
00:09:26,809 --> 00:09:30,980
we know is not a useful thing to do and

217
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:36,799
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure why they were</font>

218
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:40,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that either this one is a is a bug</font>

219
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,470
and it's a withdrawal bug and what

220
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:44,239
happens is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there these paths that stay</font>

221
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,209
around in the routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> table for weeks</font>

222
00:09:44,239 --> 00:09:48,679
until somebody resets<font color="#CCCCCC"> the session so</font>

223
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:51,679
they'll just kind of hang out there even

224
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">though the routes gone away it's not the</font>

225
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,660
count to infinity bug he's done quite a

226
00:09:53,239 --> 00:10:00,709
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this it's actually a</font>

227
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:03,709
different bug this is my<font color="#CCCCCC"> very favorite</font>

228
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:05,988
one these are actually like really long

229
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:07,518
paths that they kind of the route goes

230
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:09,559
away and the pads grow and grow and grow

231
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,100
and then they all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> go away</font>

232
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:15,919
all by themselves and what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

233
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:19,309
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of peering policies</font>

234
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,689
like we have now so as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP I'll pier</font>

235
00:10:19,309 --> 00:10:22,339
with a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of people and then</font>

236
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:24,829
I'll just redistribute everything that I

237
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,869
here to everyone else so you know

238
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,388
usually if you're a transit provider you

239
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:31,759
don't you are not a transit provider you

240
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:33,889
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> rien Anse all your peers routes to</font>

241
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:34,910
all your other peers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in v6 land</font>

242
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:37,339
right now that's what everybody's doing

243
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,829
and so you get into these situations

244
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:41,689
where it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a while for all the</font>

245
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:45,939
redistribute turns from all the other

246
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:45,939
networks to go away pretty cool

247
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:54,910
this one is is a filtering thing I guess

248
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,870
nobody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading the headers on these</font>

249
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:00,189
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of funny</font>

250
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,680
you know just didn't know how to do

251
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,940
those ackles so we're going to you know

252
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,069
advertise a whole bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

253
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,959
specifics because you know the route map

254
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:12,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">just didn't work as we intended maybe we</font>

255
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:14,739
need one of those tools from earlier so

256
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,060
and let's see this one is something

257
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:18,430
we've all seen a million times before

258
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,920
private<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS is getting advertised just</font>

259
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:23,079
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they should and I guess people</font>

260
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:28,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">are getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at I cleaning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it up</font>

261
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:31,029
but it's still not going away so let's

262
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:32,980
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what so what's new what is it</font>

263
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:35,620
what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> news like I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said the six</font>

264
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">phone is going away which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know</font>

265
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,949
kind of it was a great experiment and a

266
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:43,420
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of works been done some of the bad</font>

267
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:45,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that were happening are starting</font>

268
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,490
to decrease like the number of bogan

269
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,199
networks and stuff is going away

270
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:54,339
unallocated<font color="#E5E5E5"> a/s numbers being announced</font>

271
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:56,709
is getting less there's commercial ipv6

272
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:59,019
backbones in Europe and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably think</font>

273
00:11:56,709 --> 00:12:00,430
that Garrett wants to know anybody else

274
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:02,649
who might be doing that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk</font>

275
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:05,019
about that there's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

276
00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:07,720
tunnels going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and there's there's</font>

277
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:09,579
problems with the tunnels like countries

278
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,100
and you know organizations in Europe

279
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:13,540
will get one tunnel for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> their all of</font>

280
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,610
their transit you know they're outside

281
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,079
traffic but it goes to the US so to get

282
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,639
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> another part of Europe they're going</font>

283
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:20,649
through the US and then back you know

284
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,500
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of stuff is still lovely</font>

285
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:27,130
and happening so you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> always get</font>

286
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,899
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than one tunnel folks are actually</font>

287
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:30,790
using traceroute because you know it

288
00:12:28,899 --> 00:12:35,889
hasn't been around very long and we need

289
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:38,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start using it let's see I like this</font>

290
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:42,880
one ipv6 is no worse than ipv4 I'm not

291
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure if that's a bonus and US is</font>

292
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,920
starting to get more allocations before

293
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:52,360
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was moving along</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slower so what needs</font>

294
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,620
to be done

295
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:57,319
work needs to be done on<font color="#E5E5E5"> filtering</font>

296
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,269
recommendations and it seems like this

297
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:02,000
group probably has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of that</font>

298
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:05,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">information from before there's also a</font>

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,339
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a ipv6 minimum hearing</font>

300
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,050
policy and I have a reference to that

301
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,120
and I'd encourage people to get involved

302
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:13,729
because which there are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> differences</font>

303
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,009
and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are trying to put that</font>

304
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:19,639
down so that you know people so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

305
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:22,279
there's recommendations bad tunnels need

306
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,769
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away people need to stop you know</font>

307
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving transit to the world although you</font>

308
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:31,579
know if you don't pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for transit that's</font>

309
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:37,100
kind of nice bug your<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> offer ipv6</font>

310
00:13:31,579 --> 00:13:39,258
so I'll you ISPs use<font color="#CCCCCC"> traceroute get rid</font>

311
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:43,519
of non useful tunnels that kind of stuff

312
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:45,699
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the myth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was talking about the</font>

313
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,350
minimum<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering policy project</font>

314
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:51,910
recommendations like I said jump here

315
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:54,470
over bad tunnels use prefix filters

316
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,329
filter private private asm's you know

317
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:00,290
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff we do in v4 needs to</font>

318
00:13:56,329 --> 00:14:02,060
happen in v6 you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> only give</font>

319
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:05,120
transit if the person you're giving

320
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,649
transit to wants it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> junk like I said</font>

321
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,339
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take transit from too many peers</font>

322
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:12,980
and again avoid your single upstream

323
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,569
over in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our continental tunnel it's all</font>

324
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,259
stuff that we've heard before and before

325
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:21,130
and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the references and again</font>

326
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:23,959
I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stress the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> myth one because</font>

327
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,279
they're looking for folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to participate</font>

328
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,380
and it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that at some point</font>

329
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,050
we're going to be really fired up about

330
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:32,420
v6 here and and having<font color="#CCCCCC"> it being involved</font>

331
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:38,089
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy making is is a really good</font>

332
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:39,920
thing and oh wait and so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

333
00:14:38,089 --> 00:14:42,500
of this talk but in the fine tradition

334
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,149
of quotes that I collect like all these

335
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,949
headers I had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I thought</font>

336
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,899
were a particular interest so if you

337
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">were reading your email you might want</font>

338
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just stop and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look up for a minute</font>

339
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:55,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">because this one is my favorite this was</font>

340
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,399
actually in a trouble ticket where I

341
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:57,399
used to work

342
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:05,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could unroot</font>

343
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:09,340
the switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be cool and I had</font>

344
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:11,230
I had a couple more so anyway and the

345
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,880
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one I'm here was also in a trouble</font>

346
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:17,260
ticket because we need to left justify

347
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:25,120
all the cards in the router anyway um

348
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:27,910
thanks and the last one was actually a

349
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,350
Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush quote I like that I left off</font>

350
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:35,850
part of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I didn't want to</font>

351
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">offend anyone so are there any questions</font>

352
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,989
