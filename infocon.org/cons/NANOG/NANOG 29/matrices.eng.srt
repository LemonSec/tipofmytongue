00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:06,029
Thanks this is obviously joint work with

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,960
a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people at ATT and also Dave</font>

3
00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,250
Donahoe at Stanford I'll jump straight

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,809
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is we're</font>

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,450
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a traffic matrix for our</font>

6
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,609
network what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic matrix is</font>

7
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end-to-end demands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a matrix of the</font>

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,029
end-to-end demands in our network so the

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:25,140
traffic from point A to point B the

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:27,090
traffic from point A to point c as it

11
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,630
turns out it's rather hard to measure

12
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,210
this in a large number of settings so

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,040
wouldn't it be nice if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font>

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">measurements that we already have one</font>

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,620
set of measurements we already have is

16
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,200
SNMP the simple network management

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,910
protocol these measurements are very

18
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,399
nice in the sense that as the name

19
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,288
suggests they're pretty simple they

20
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,430
don't require<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of overhead that</font>

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,440
don't require a lot of extra

22
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,210
infrastructure and they're very widely

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,500
deployed almost ubiquitous in the

24
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,660
internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can get these sort of</font>

25
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,640
measurements from almost anywhere it's a

26
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,230
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice source of data has one big</font>

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,210
problem in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular context</font>

28
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,209
doesn't actually tell us the traffic

29
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,979
matrix so what it does tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

30
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the traffic on each link but what we</font>

31
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know is where the traffic is</font>

32
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:10,080
actually going in the network so we

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just about the traffic</font>

34
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,380
anomaly we want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get to this</font>

35
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,179
where is the traffic going in our

36
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,399
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have a very quick example</font>

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,189
here to show you why we care about that

38
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,750
this is a reliability analysis we all

39
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,429
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an IP network under a</font>

40
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,020
failure the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be rerouted</font>

41
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,090
through the network so then it works

42
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,798
reliable but but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it to be</font>

43
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">really reliable you have to have</font>

44
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,420
redundant capacity in the network in

45
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,798
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry that excess load so how</font>

46
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,799
do you work out how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity you</font>

47
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,420
need on your lengths now well there is a

48
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:40,890
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's to simulate</font>

49
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,990
the network under the set of failures

50
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,110
and see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much capacity you need on</font>

51
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,390
those links unfortunately one of the

52
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,820
inputs you need for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or maybe not</font>

53
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,970
unfortunately for us now is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

54
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,758
have a traffic matrix to put in to this

55
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:03,299
particular setting to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

56
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:06,270
sort of simulation so what's the traffic

57
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,649
matrix well this is a set of equations

58
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,060
to try and give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a quick picture of</font>

59
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,790
what we mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic matrix</font>

60
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:14,040
basically what we want to do is measure

61
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,989
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things on the</font>

62
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic on these individual</font>

63
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:20,400
routes through the network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font>

64
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,260
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure is the wise the</font>

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,689
traffic on the links and we can write a

66
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,450
set of equations here y equals ax which

67
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:30,328
gives us the what we call tomographic

68
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,369
constraint equations the problem here is

69
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:34,079
that for a non-trivial network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

70
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,120
highly<font color="#E5E5E5"> under constrained system of</font>

71
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:38,579
equations that is we have many more

72
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,209
unknowns here than we have loans why is

73
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:44,189
that well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we have seen a</font>

74
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,139
network of n nodes we have something of

75
00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:49,170
the order of n links and measurements

76
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:51,480
but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> N squared demands so as n</font>

77
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,858
becomes large obviously you end in this

78
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,040
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you have a highly under</font>

79
00:02:52,859 --> 00:02:59,700
constraint system there's a bunch of

80
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,310
similar problems from astronomy

81
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:04,500
seismology magical medical imaging for

82
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,590
instance it computer-aided tomography

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,510
the cat and cat scan is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

84
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:10,919
sort of problem and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason it's</font>

85
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,858
similar is because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set of</font>

86
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:15,329
measurements that you can make they're

87
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:16,799
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the measurements you want you have a</font>

88
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:18,479
set of measurements you can see through

89
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,239
someone's head but you can't see exactly

90
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:23,190
what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> head it's</font>

91
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,699
pretty undesirable in medical imaging to

92
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:28,349
actually you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know put probes in there in</font>

93
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:30,299
networking it's somewhat easier problem

94
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:32,638
that's somewhat different in other ways

95
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,349
so we need to use some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the techniques</font>

96
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:35,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people have here but we can't use</font>

97
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:39,478
all of those techniques we have to adapt

98
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:40,888
them to networking the technique we've

99
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,720
been using is minimum mutual information

100
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff here I don't</font>

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,599
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone to absorb this in this</font>

102
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:47,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm just going to really</font>

103
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,060
skip over that and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you some</font>

104
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:52,530
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intuition here basically we're</font>

105
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,180
going to take this set of equations the

106
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,430
problem with a set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of equations is it's</font>

107
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's it gives us a set of possible</font>

108
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,900
solutions not the you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

109
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,578
tell us one solution we have a whole

110
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,680
space of possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> solutions so the</font>

111
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:07,709
problem is not to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution the</font>

112
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:13,139
problem is to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best solution</font>

113
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:15,299
from this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> space we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

114
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,799
particular solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> though to give us a</font>

115
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,418
starting point and there's one solution

116
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:24,229
here which we call an independent

117
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:26,659
solution it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a it's</font>

118
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,700
also corresponds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a gravity model and</font>

119
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,000
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is simply that we use a</font>

120
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:33,590
the traffic from location to location is

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,240
going to be proportional<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the traffic</font>

122
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of those two locations so this gives us</font>

123
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,170
a starting point and then our solution

124
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just going to be the solution with</font>

125
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:44,800
which satisfies our set of equations but

126
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:50,870
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is closest to this starting point</font>

127
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,610
so here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of results the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis</font>

128
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,680

135
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,550
there are quite a few points which

large networks it scales to hundreds of

nodes these are really good things it's

also really robust to errors in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

SNMP data is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a perfect source of</font>

method is really important<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,070
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> this example of reliability</font>

example of reliability analysis in

practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is something that I</font>

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">find really amazing this so this is our</font>

159
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,390
errors in the traffic matrix and you can

160
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,280
see we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of errors here you</font>

161
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,590
might expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you use this in a</font>

162
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,419
practical application you do cite you

163
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,250
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> results are somewhat similar</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

164
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,050
this but actually the errors really tend

165
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,910
to cancel out here so in this

166
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:16,550
reliability<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis what we have on the</font>

167
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:19,010
x-axis is the actual loads predicted

168
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,500
using the real measured traffic matrix

169
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:25,130
and on the y axis we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the estimated</font>

matrices gathered from<font color="#E5E5E5"> linked data and</font>

172
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,000
you can see we're almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> spawned there's</font>

173
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,210
only a few points<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are even you know</font>

174
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,170
noticeably off of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that line so the story</font>

175
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,909
is here really that

176
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:41,770
this works pretty well in terms of

177
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,300
accuracy for getting these things but

178
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:47,590
when you use them in practice<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's even</font>

179
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:48,970
better so we we've done a bunch of

180
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,039
experiments on this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

181
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">go through any of this in any any great</font>

182
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,670
amount of detail because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

183
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:56,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the time in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of robustness and</font>

184
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,030
sensitivity and so on we've tried it on

185
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,560
different topologies we've tried it with

186
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,849
different sources of measurement data

187
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,350
the thing I really want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across is</font>

188
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:07,150
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being quite heavily</font>

189
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:10,270
research now we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of papers</font>

190
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:14,859
I you can get those papers from our

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:17,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">website and that really brings me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

192
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:20,170
conclusion i have the key references

here you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them off of my webpage</font>

194
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:25,390
we have implemented this and we've been

195

using it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 18 tease backbone now for a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">while that's in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AS 7018 we have our</font>

197
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:32,739
early traffic matrices for now more than

198
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">a year and it really is accurate enough</font>
