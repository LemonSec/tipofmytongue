1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
okay our first up presentation this

2
00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,060
afternoon is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font>

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,389
relationship between network security

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,460
and spam and I'm sure some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

5
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:13,919
probably get as much spam as you do real

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,010
mail and are probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interested in</font>

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,009
how a 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> L is combating this so I'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:22,890
to introduce Carl<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hutzler who's been at</font>

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,500
AOL for about three years and in that

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:33,930
time he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the director of their</font>

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,489
anti-spam group Carl thank you I wanted

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start off and apologize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

13
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:38,968
artwork here I couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

14
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:41,218
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get rid of it if I would have I would</font>

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,860
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> taken it off so my apologies I</font>

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,789
wanted to thank this group in particular

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,100
for inviting me i am not a network

18
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,379
engineer and when i talked to some of

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,510
the people of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the breaks in this crowd I</font>

20
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,949
really feel like I'm overwhelmed with

21
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,629
the amount of knowledge it's out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

22
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> just completely goes over the top</font>

23
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,858
<font color="#E5E5E5">of my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> head but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

24
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,329
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> for allowing me to talk for a</font>

25
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:06,450
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes about a problem that I</font>

26
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,830
think overlaps both of our areas of

27
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,350
expertise just a quick couple of numbers

28
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,970
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are interesting a well currently</font>

29
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,339
blocks about eighty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the mail</font>

30
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,580
that's attempted<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our front door some</font>

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,780
days more some days less some days up to

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:27,509
2.4 2.5 billion a day which is an

33
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:31,979
actually astronomical number from

34
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:34,320
anybody's point of view the number of

35
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">emails has doubled pretty much every</font>

36
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,369
year for the last six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years and of</font>

37
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">course our members not only complain</font>

38
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:44,579
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that it's</font>

39
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,930
in their inbox something that they have

40
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,110
to go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> but of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of it</font>

41
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:52,770
is more on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questionable content side</font>

42
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:55,590
of things this is a graph that shows

43
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,170
just a little bit in terms of over the

44
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:01,409
last year and a half or so how much mail

45
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,860
has been attempted which is the the red

46
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,210
bar line versus the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ret the blue line</font>

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,399
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much mail we actually</font>

48
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,899
deliver to our membership and you can

49
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,340
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much that's gone up over there</font>

50
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,879
over

51
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,250
I'm sorry if you can't read the scale

52
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:23,859
the top of that shows about 22 billion

53
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:26,989
or so that are attempted each day the

54
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,379
for those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who who track spammers</font>

55
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:31,849
there's there's a pretty simple formula

56
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:34,040
for what they're trying to achieve it

57
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:35,629
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to the number of</font>

58
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">emails they can send and the number of</font>

59
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:40,190
recipients on those emails and then

60
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:42,110
multiplying that by one of two methods

61
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,540
either the number of IP addresses they

62
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,459
have available to them or the number of

63
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,260
accounts if for half perhaps they're on

64
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:50,959
a free email service or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

65
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,410
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of messages they can</font>

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,660
send / account most spammers are trying

67
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,780
to send at least a million maybe fifty

68
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,489
to a hundred million of these a day

69
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:05,810
we've got a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of amazing controls and</font>

70
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:08,239
amazing technologies from DNS blacklist

71
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,629
that I'm sure a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people use to</font>

72
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,730
some homegrown technologies at AOL where

73
00:03:11,629 --> 00:03:17,090
we limit how much people can send / IP

74
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,209
per account per hour per minute yet we

75
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:21,230
still see people able to get by that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

76
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,730
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

77
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:26,929
reasons are some of the ways that they

78
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:28,310
do that specifically with IP addresses

79
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">and specifically with networks which</font>

80
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:34,639
this crowd obviously knows a lot about

81
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:36,500
and I mentioned a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

82
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,329
go off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the block spam you can look at</font>

83
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,190

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:42,109

85
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:46,010
bad senders you can look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> good bed</font>

86
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:47,450
recipient ratios but as we all know this

87
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,399
has not been enough even some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

content filters<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bayesian filters and so</font>

93
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,910
today's spam can simply be traced to

94
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,269
network and or application security

95
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,918
issues pretty much every technique that

96
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,680
the spammers are using right now to get

into AOL is exploiting a security hole

98
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,209
it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> impressive and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've lifted a</font>

100
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,740
space hijacking and

101
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,500
malware virus infected pcs I'm going to

102
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,310
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little more detail today</font>

103
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,560
but there's certainly some other

104
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:30,890
techniques out there misconfigured

105
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,210
proxies and open relays registration

106
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,640

millions of accounts fraudulently our

sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other techniques that are</font>

go through this I'm mostly going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

111
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,550
describe what we see and and some

112
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,800
examples I actually don't have solutions

113
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a good question and</font>

114
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,400
answer session at the end of this and

115
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,830
maybe some hallway discussions outside

116
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,489
on some ways that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can go about</font>

117
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:04,099
preventing this type of activity the

118
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,770
example here just<font color="#CCCCCC"> shows an IP range that</font>

119
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,900
was owned by a company that perhaps went

120
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,729
out of business someone came in and

121
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe socially engineered their upstream</font>

122
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,050
to send them maybe a piece a letterhead

123
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:16,940
that looked like the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> said yep</font>

124
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:19,370
that's me haven't been using<font color="#CCCCCC"> it for a</font>

125
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,780
while that's my IP space that then gets

126
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,430
transferred and routed to that

127
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,070
particular individual and they can then

128
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,200
use those IPS for you know days months

129
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,510
whatever it takes until enough of the

130
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,150
ISPs like AOL realize what's going on

131
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,560
and have them blocked the things that

132
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,049
we're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> determining is how</font>

133
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,150
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does a hacker actually steal this IP</font>

134
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,710
space in the first place we've heard

135
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:41,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">some rumors that they can do it without</font>

even<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the social engineering part</font>

137
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,160
of it they can simply if they have

138
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough access to certain level routers</font>

insert routes into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and say</font>

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are mine some spammers we believe</font>

00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:56,060
or even doing this just for a few hours

143
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,200

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it so understanding how they do</font>

00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:05,659
it is one thing if we can't figure out a

way to you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely secure the</font>

legend enough the hackers are out there

00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:38,390
compromising the stuff some of them are

00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,120

174
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,910
you can do with public policy and

183
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,250
today there was an announcement that

<font color="#E5E5E5">this network had a problem in this room</font>

contributing to the problem it it's a

191
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:04,250
nice intro to a subject because the

192
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,800
number of compromised hosts that are out

193

that was specifically sent out there by

plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> others gene is that one that</font>

I'm familiar with a lot installs and

open relay as well as other back doors

217

that allow a hacker spammer to get into

a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows operating system they've</font>

actually one interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> article that</font>

220
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,020
was in Wired just the other day was the

221
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,210
fact that they use these hosts then as

222
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,770
proxies for their web server so you

223
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,420
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even trace route into their web</font>

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,829
server and see which hosts it's on and

225
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,270
get the network to shut it down so

00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're using them all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

231
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:37,320
they can create now service attacks I

232
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,849
think we've all been<font color="#CCCCCC"> exposed to those</font>

233
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,150
we've seen some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> black lists that</font>

00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,130
recently there have been some great

238
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:01,020

240
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:06,439
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pretty famous blacklist</font>

spammers are starting to get annoyed but

244
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,830
the fact that they can't get into these

245
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:19,079
various ISPs we believe also that people

249
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,630
fact at AOL because we have this problem

on our free mail system but they're also

251

perhaps doing it at eBay and maybe

what what do you do with 20,000 pcs on

of magnitude so just quickly conclusions

322
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:28,779
large ISPs AOL included have a pretty

323
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:29,920
sophisticated set of blocking and rate

331
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:49,809
is directly because of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

335
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:58,748
what they're doing now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to find that</font>

IP space and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and blend in with</font>

337
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:03,549
actual user traffic coming through the

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:05,378
main mail servers at various ISPs they

339
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,449
can blend in with smaller rates because

340
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:09,929
they have such a huge collection<font color="#CCCCCC"> of IPs</font>

341
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:12,219
and it's very hard to differentiate a

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,149
very difficult

346
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:21,549
to block a main mail server at a large

that you can't use the old techniques of

can pick out you know one particular

spammer from a whole group of legitimate

353
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,789
mail and that becomes very difficult

354
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:39,819
using some of the content-based

00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:42,699
filtering technologies that the spammers

356
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:44,348
are finding ways around and I think it's

357

it's no secret at this point that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

spammers are employing hackers to do

364
00:14:59,409 --> 00:15:04,479
going on here is we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

365
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:06,069
have enjoyed figuring out how to reverse

engineer systems and figure out

367
00:15:06,069 --> 00:15:09,339

368
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:11,859
found out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a market for</font>

in this room we have at AOL a very rich

375
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:29,909
source of data on vulnerabilities and

376

everyone's networks including our own

these are the complaints that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get</font>

from our members<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day we get</font>

millions of them we have the ability to

00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:40,059
send you those complaints if you would

381
00:15:37,899 --> 00:15:42,009
like them all we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what IP</font>

vulnerabilities that are out there and

386
00:15:46,569 --> 00:15:51,639
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is send you these reports</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">repeat Carl's question to the audience</font>

411
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:51,079
registrar's out in the audience here so

412
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,080
he asked the question how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you detect</font>

the behavior that<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP space hacking has</font>

414
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,180
happened are there other ISPs out here

00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:01,250
that have some techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share or is there anything</font>

417
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:06,829
that the registrar's do that would

prevent people from<font color="#E5E5E5"> read you know</font>

471
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:26,540
tellme networks there's actually two

472
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,909
levels of hijacking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are at issue</font>

473
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:30,800
here the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard is talking about is</font>

474
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:33,590
where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually hijacking</font>

475
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,379
registrations of IP blocks and then

476
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,000
advertising them the other level is

477
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,830
where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are just advertising it</font>

478
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,490
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP even though they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't own it</font>

479
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:45,770
or even claim to own it in the registry

480
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:49,310
the latter could partially be dealt with

481
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:51,500
through better use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> irrs than is</font>

482
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:54,080
currently practiced but that requires

483
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,360
two things number one it requires more

484
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,210
people to accurately register their

485
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,760
routes and policy in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> irrs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and number</font>

486
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,710
two it requires people to use the tools

487
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,720
and take better advantage of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IRS in</font>

488
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:09,740
configuring their filtration on their

489
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,720
routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect number two has largely</font>

490
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:15,230
not happened due to the lack of number

491
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,260
one thank you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Randy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're next</font>

492
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:23,330
and then we'll just alternate rows

493
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:25,010
brandi passante on the long run as the

494
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:28,370
previous person said<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're ten parts</font>

495
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:30,550
one is the registration and ownership of

496
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:36,229
the route<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a tight a attestation</font>

497
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:38,629
thereof and that gets back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to x509</font>

498
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:40,040
search cetera et cetera not not so much

499
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,910
the hijacking by stealing it from the

500
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:47,570
registry but being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to tell a router</font>

501
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:50,720
that's a BGP speaker<font color="#E5E5E5"> I own this prefix</font>

502
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:52,850
and secondly is the protocols between

503
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,920
the routers so

504
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,540
that we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that comes from and passes</font>

505
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:59,630
through routers that it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

506
00:20:56,540 --> 00:21:03,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and people should remember the secure</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP session from Salt Lake City and</font>

508
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:11,179
maybe you'll be speaking about this with

509
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:13,760
your panel next I hope no oh why<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

510
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:15,410
simple router security not so much

511
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,080
because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not simple router</font>

512
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:23,810
security this is changes to the BGP

513
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:25,850
protocol to have the BGP attest to the

514
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:29,629
correctness of the routing announcements

515
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:33,770
as opposed to oh just hardening your

516
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:36,380
router a basic hygiene<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you yes</font>

517
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:38,660
extraordinarily complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> BG security not</font>

00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:40,040
simple Oh Todd Underwood from Renesys

519
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:42,230
we're one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies that does</font>

520
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,420
real-time alarming on v GP and it turns

521
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,340
out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really useful but it's really</font>

522
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,850
hard to do and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do fast and</font>

523
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:52,879
so and and i think what you find or what

524
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:55,840
we find is that the these<font color="#CCCCCC"> two kinds of</font>

525
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,740
hijackings are difficult to tell apart

526
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,590
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen in</font>

527
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:02,660
hijackings is people will<font color="#E5E5E5"> complaint we</font>

528
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:05,030
maintain historical data back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> january</font>

529
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,950
first 2002 and people will come on the

530
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:09,170
hijacking list or come on nanog and say

531
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,520
somebody's hijacked my space oh my god

532
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,690
oh my god and we look at it and say yeah

533
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,810
they've been announcing that for four

534
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,520
months yeah they did hijack your space

535
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:18,740
they did it for months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you just</font>

536
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,350
notice and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's what what</font>

537
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:22,490
happens to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people is there's a</font>

538
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,199
prefix or there's an allocation or a

539
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,670
part of an allocation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just</font>

540
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,350
don't use and it's easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

541
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:29,300
that they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> use and you advertise a</font>

542
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,889
more specific for a part of that that

543
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,409
clearly hasn't been allocated in their

544
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:35,930
networks and then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

545
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:37,850
works for a long time do do is there any

546
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,680
social engineering needed in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

547
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,840
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to a certain router at a</font>

548
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,120
certain level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the structure of the</font>

549
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet to pull this off in other words</font>

550
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,139
do you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you know somebody on</font>

551
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,620
the take or somebody you've engineered

552
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,570
to sort of trust you or can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do</font>

553
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it blindly is there a way to sort of</font>

554
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:59,210
track back to the guy who actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did</font>

555
00:22:55,250 --> 00:23:00,650
this or shut down the offending<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP from</font>

556
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,780
actually connecting to you in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future</font>

557
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,640
so if you have the history of the

558
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,200
announcements which we do and some other

559
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,200
people keep at least reasonably

560
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,820
coarse-grained we keep it

561
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,860
one second<font color="#CCCCCC"> level some people do it at a</font>

562
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,178
24-hour level but if you have the

563
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:14,070
history of the announcement<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly</font>

564
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:16,260
announcements are public right they you

565
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,760
tell everybody you know but into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:19,980
question of whether social engineering

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,539
is required it<font color="#E5E5E5"> frequently isn't there's</font>

568
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,460
a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who just accept</font>

569
00:23:21,539 --> 00:23:24,690
announcements from everyone and there's

570
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,399
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other people who accept</font>

571
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,289
announcements from them so it goes back

I'm couplings that you were asking about

how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people can hijack addresses and</font>

words that we haven't assigned anybody

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,399
and my<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess is that they're not out</font>

622
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:38,580
publicly that they're being announced to

623
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:40,289

624

customers who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> moley home to people</font>

625
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:43,259
we pair with so we take our own

628
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:50,158
they're probably announced with a

if space is reused for another purpose

<font color="#E5E5E5">can give you some information on or how</font>

customers in theory of course never spam

684
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,930
but they probably do but they attract

685
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,660
all these people getting click-through

687
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:03,660
was busy complaining that they had some

688
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:06,300
AP name on blocks and so I called Aaron

689
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:08,210
and said gee the paper trail looks good

690
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,350
is the right name for the AP

691
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,450
registration and they're over<font color="#CCCCCC"> here now</font>

692
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,949
but it's all the same guy that our

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:16,470
customers are noun<font color="#E5E5E5"> Singh to us what do</font>

694
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:17,970
we do and I was basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> told we can't</font>

00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:20,760
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's another registry anyway</font>

696
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,230
but in fact all we do is give you the

697
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,120
space and what's done with it later

698
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,700
where it's used in the world is your

699

700
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:31,590
really all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right to take space from one</font>

701
