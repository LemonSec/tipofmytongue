1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:08,129
i'm danny i'm going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about meds</font>

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">jenny pay the goals potato terminology</font>

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:12,210
what meds are where they're useful and

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,129
then where meds break because meds

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,960
actually breaking a lot of places and

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,580
not sure if everyone's aware of where

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,289
they break maybe lots of folks are but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,509
think lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks aren't as well so</font>

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,960
that's that's the goal of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic is</font>

10
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,330
to convey that that point so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right</font>

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,890
so increase awareness of you know the

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,019
deployment considerations is the primary

13
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,340
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to make operators aware there</font>

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:34,710
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of vendor against</font>

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,300
intricacies with with implementations

16
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,500
associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> any DS and how they're</font>

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,269
used and how you know how an

18
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,829
implementation actually handles meds and

19
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,410
what behaviors they apply to those meds

20
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,610
and that's that's the main thing I

21
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,069
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get across in this there are</font>

22
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">also some protocol issues that we're</font>

23
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,370
we're meds are more likely to tickle

24
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:51,510
things like persistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

25
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,038
oscillations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

26
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,570
briefly as well so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,280
nothing new or you know brilliant are

28
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,800
sore earth-shattering here it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

29
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,300
some things that folks need to be aware

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,449
of and it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> not everyone's</font>

31
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,739
wearing those so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so before you</font>

32
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:09,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">start how many folks are actually know</font>

33
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:11,580
what your med policy is good<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many</font>

34
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,090
folks except meds from customers as a

35
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,470
matter of policy by default and what

36
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">about from peers anyone except image</font>

37
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,250
from peers<font color="#CCCCCC"> write a file to the matter</font>

38
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,600
boss<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay good and how many folks don't</font>

39
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,310
know I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise your hand are you</font>

40
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so potato terminology</font>

41
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,159
I guess people people mix you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they</font>

42
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">used a potato determent like hot potato</font>

43
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,729
meaning you know tossing a hot but they

44
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,680
go back and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 one's hands and</font>

45
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,030
they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to refer to closest exit</font>

46
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,380
routing in other words get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it away from</font>

47
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,960
you as fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can get it away from</font>

48
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,640
me that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the default behavior</font>

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,710
more or less for closest exit or you

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,240
know shortest path routing and so you

51
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,059
know hot potato equals closest exit

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,289
route me in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this context co potato which</font>

53
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,689
some people call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it cold potato</font>

54
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,180
everything makes much sense but it's a

55
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:58,919
best exit routing means you carry it to

56
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,540
the place in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the exit point on your</font>

57
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,719
network that you believe is the optimal

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,040
exit point some folks well it's it's

59
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,880
more commonly I guess it's more

60
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,550
intuitively refer

61
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,869
to his best<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> erotic and the mashed</font>

62
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:11,819
potato which is probably more common

63
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,650
than any is this could be string

64
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:16,799
potatoes whatever potatoes you like

65
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,930
potatoes<font color="#CCCCCC"> down island but uh it's it's</font>

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
basically it's less than ideal you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

67
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,170
you're doing one thing and you're

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,730
actually doing another and it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

69
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,950
really suboptimal rounding which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

70
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">show you in a moment why why it's a bad</font>

71
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,488
thing at some points and while I get

72
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:33,030
things like aggregation can cause some

73
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:36,060
really bad problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so meds are</font>

74
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,400
multi exit discriminator or a multi x.x

75
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,489
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk is what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's referred to in in</font>

80
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,220
the protocol you on fire on so and the

81
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,769
spec actually says it's used to convey

82
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,870
you know that the optimal entry point or

83
00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,250
new and it to discriminate between entry

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,768
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it's the lowest met as the</font>

things like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s path and local</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> press and</font>

90
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,600
you know longest prefix being equal so

<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where meds make sense so this is a</font>

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,319
really trivial diagram here to show you

where<font color="#E5E5E5"> meds make sense the blue line</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">showing you that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the meta five made a</font>

that becomes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 path because uh</font>

101
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,400
because they asked to hundreds in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

lower med value across the upper you

know the c2d path and said this is the

optimal<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to enter my network or this</font>

network and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they s100 honors those</font>

107
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,650
meds it takes a more optimal path to

108
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,510
reach the destination d dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so</font>

109
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,910
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see if that didn't</font>

115
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,040
and that's less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than optimal if if</font>

116
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,109
you've got a bigger<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture than having</font>

117
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,250
from

118
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:14,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I deployment considerations</font>

119
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,320
actually this these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

120
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:20,980
want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in just a moment</font>

121
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,420
so meds break with aggregation so this

122
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,760
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something a lot of folks don't seem</font>

123
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,130
to be aware of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's you know aggregates</font>

124
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,390
are often basically lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks</font>

125
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:30,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually Vijay talked about this</font>

126
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,990
yesterday some i think but aggregates

127
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:33,880
are generated from multiple core routers

128
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,920
or multiple dual home routers within a

129
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,060
network access to just jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font>

130
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:42,400
picture here for you and what happens is

131
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,310
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you've</font>

132
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,340
assigned 10 11 24 to a customer but you

133
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,200
own 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 / 16 and what happens is you</font>

134
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,849
just announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> that aggregate from one</font>

135
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,469
or two or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 points in your network</font>

136
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:55,120
maybe it's all your core routers or core

137
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,950
routers that are in the backbone center

138
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,200
core<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network or in a certain place</font>

139
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:00,670
typically you don't announce your

140
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,380
aggregates from like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a singly</font>

141
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,520
connected peer router because if that

142
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,750
router goes down and it's still

143
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,150
announcing the aggregate you'll black

144
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,820
hole traffic so so what you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

145
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:14,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aggregates announced from this point</font>

146
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:17,140
and it's it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> VDS associated with</font>

147
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,969
that aggregate and so then when when

148
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:22,630
someone's to reach of a destination you

149
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:24,250
know 10 1 10 / 24 they use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Med</font>

150
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,690
associated with the aggregate rather

151
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,590
than with the more specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix</font>

152
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:29,110
because they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more</font>

153
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,270
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> information and so they prefer</font>

154
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,910
this path<font color="#CCCCCC"> always for all traffic going</font>

156
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:39,040
results in suboptimal 14 path right and

157
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,460
this is basically there have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been some I</font>

158
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,320
guess some some tests or some trials of

159
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,909
people accepting more specifics in other

160
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,969
words if you have pop aggregates or you

161
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,830
know or new geographic regional

162

we're announcing some other prefix it

171
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,850
probably wouldn't apply because the Med

172
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,890
would be associated with the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop</font>

00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:14,650
presumably unless you statically said

Trinity values so anyway that's that's

175
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,130
what you see that's where meds break

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,670
with aggregation is this it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

so so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are just a couple there</font>

202
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:18,020
there are actually several more vendor

behaviors or you know implementation

204
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,190
issues and they used to be aware of with

205
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:24,050
the implementation to deploying it it's

206
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,960
a matter of at like advertising bgp meds

207
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,830
to ibgp viewers by default to ebgp peers

208

by the fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> federations you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

209
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:35,030
basically comparing meds between

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,090
confederation ebgp peers and between

211
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:40,669

213
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,510
that's that's been pretty flaky in the

214
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,520
past another one is if there's no med

215
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:48,830
it's the least preferable it's it's

216
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,710
worse than a maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> acts meed values so</font>

basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> maxamed value is</font>

unfeasible is something implementations

have done comparing minutes point

227
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:14,570
what's happening is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> churn actually</font>

guess parlons for that is deterministic

232
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,720
m.ed is the way you configure it or

unconfigured and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you need</font>

to be aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in your network and we'll</font>

if you got questions on that if you

haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> looked at that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you got a</font>

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this route oscillation your</font>

245

00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:55,040
something going to be aware of so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a</font>

flap dampening enemy d turn so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

248
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,399
something actually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vijay talked</font>

249
00:08:56,330 --> 00:09:00,770
about yesterday as well when they were

250
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,810
changing their IDP metrics the<font color="#CCCCCC"> meed</font>

251
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:04,550
values were derived from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my GP metrics</font>

252
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:06,199
dynamically and when you change those

253
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:07,520
eyes appealing metrics if there's no

254
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,440
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like state there you know</font>

255
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:11,720
temporal stay in other words you keep

256
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,430
the oldest m.ed value regardless of the

257
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:15,620
most stable route then you're going to

258
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,229
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new MeV value with your bgp</font>

259
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,700
update and so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> results in turn or</font>

260
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,830
instability and you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

261
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,540
and and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> can result in route</font>

262
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:25,850
suppression around flat dampening<font color="#CCCCCC"> locked</font>

263
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,870
lots of instability actually the link

264
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:31,640
here so this this is a link Craig and

265
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:34,459
Robin some other folks did and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

266
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,990
the the the document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Vijay with</font>

267
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,510
referencing yesterday and this this

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,279
document<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talks about about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

269
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,439
know the there's a domino effect where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

270
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:44,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">GP metrics change in the resilient new</font>

271
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,610
m.ed values and new bgp updates are

272
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,320
propagated and routes are advertised and

273
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,880
someone because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your peer</font>

274
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,709
prefers a different path and their

275
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,240
results in a new route being selected

276
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,219
and that's advertised and so forth so

277
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,630
there's a domino effect that that occurs

278
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,890
from this and so that's what you know

279
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:01,670
one of the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that this</font>

280
00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:02,810
document talks about so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay pretty</font>

281
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,300
match between the different autonomous

282
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:07,819
systems one of the reasons this isn't a

283
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,529
good idea is because most service

284
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,750
writers use different policies to derive

285
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,370
m.ed values so if i compare meds between

286
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,220
two different and jason alien or two

287
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:18,260
different PA esas then if one uses

288
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,029
values you know one to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten for all their</font>

289
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,890
enemy d values another one<font color="#CCCCCC"> uses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

290
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:23,450
high values then<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to always</font>

291
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,709
prefer the lower values and so I'm

292
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,300
always going to prefer sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

293
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:28,279
traffic to one peer over the other

294
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:30,649
that's that's one example the same

295
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,350
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> derived from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> igp metrics</font>

296
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:34,670
if they use additive versus local which

297
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:35,690
doesn't make a lot of sense but you

298
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,300
could still do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if something</font>

299
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:39,680
misconfigured if they use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same igp</font>

300
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,270
like one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we used to see</font>

301
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,739
one of the networks that worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on was</font>

302
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:44,870
the peers who used<font color="#CCCCCC"> isas had</font>

303
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,850
smaller metric space and so we always

304
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefer them over the ones who used ospf</font>

305
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,510
because there was a huge metric space

306
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:52,399
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically use that and so we</font>

307
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,020
you know if meds<font color="#E5E5E5"> were employed for that</font>

308
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,850
purpose you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> always use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the lower</font>

309
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,420
m.ed values so in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pier</font>

310
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that used is so and then you know they</font>

311
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,180
may not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> your peers may not even be</font>

312
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,339
aware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're sending you meds or</font>

313
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,020
accepting meds from you and so or they

314
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:07,220
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be sending them at all so if</font>

315
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,870
you're comparing meds between different

316
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,930
a esas and there's no m.ed value and

317
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,120
your implementation compares m.ed values

318
00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:15,859
of nothing you know or makes it 0 for

319
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,630
example which is what the new spec says

320
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:21,320
it says if there's no me de lu<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider</font>

321
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:22,730
an m.ed value<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 then then that's going</font>

322
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,959
to be something in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pier is</font>

323
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:27,320
always going to win over a pier that

324
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">send humans so security considerations</font>

325
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,770
this is pretty intuitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you</font>

326
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:32,630
accept meds from peers there are lots of

327
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,339
attributes you can use to influence for

328
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,399
our policy or you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> forwarding past</font>

329
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:39,140
election from your peers and so the you

330
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,000
know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's images one more thing</font>

331
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,029
they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to manipulate you i mean</font>

332
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,589
manipulate your past selection given you

333
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:47,120
could do this with local per FAS path

334
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:48,589
anything else but made to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it a</font>

335
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,170
little easier and if you don't have

336
00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,970
checks on m.ed values then then it's

337
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:54,229
something that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they may be</font>

338
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,490
able to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> away with their there are</font>

339
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:59,120
lots of things you do with this from

340
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">that front so okay bgp update packing</font>

341
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,890
basically you respect allows bgp spec

342
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,360
house for all the withdrawals you want

343
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,290
to be sent in an<font color="#E5E5E5"> update message you</font>

344
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,790
don't have to send Ashley hbu

345
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:11,300
information for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those because V</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GPO</font>

346
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:13,339
announces the best prefix well you've

347
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:16,130
also got the capability if the attribute

348
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,720
set like a s path next<font color="#E5E5E5"> hop m.ed all the</font>

349
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,149
attributes associated with the set of

350
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,279
prefixes are exactly the same then you

351
00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:23,810
can pack it's referred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as update</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pack</font>

352
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:25,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can put all those prefixes in a</font>

353
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:27,410
single update message and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

354
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,060
provides is you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to send lots</font>

355
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,010
and lots of update messages and there's

356
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:32,719
this huge benefit in processing overhead

357
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:35,660
link bandwidth saying that kind of thing

358
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,790
and if you're accepting any DS from

359
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,709
peers then you know when you get some

360
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:42,199
huge array of<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DS then you can't pack</font>

361
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:43,910
those those those updates are those

362
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,470
routes with with other routes that have

363
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,120
a similar set of attributes and so

364
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:51,000
there's a observable I guess

365
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,910
decrease in in the benefit of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

366
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,860
from accepting so with that said

367
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,839
conclusions are meds working lots of

368
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,160
places they break in lots of places<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

369
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,390
should be aware of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not just</font>

370
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,709
something you should turn on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

371
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,240
we've set meds we do you know there's

372
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,520
some marketing thing because you could

373
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,110
actually be making things worse and you

374
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">should be aware of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> difference</font>

375
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,440
there's a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm working on</font>

376
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,150
vijay's working on it with me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font>

377
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,339
got some some really good feedback some

378
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:15,930
other folks and it's documenting

379
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,600
everything in this as well as several

380
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,979
other things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll be available soon</font>

381
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,480
is probably I don't know how many people

382
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">are actually know what grow is its</font>

383
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,070
global routing operations working group

384
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:28,650
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea it was a prefix taxonomy</font>

385
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,720
working group I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's kind of</font>

386
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:32,189
the operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of IDR I guess</font>

387
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,510
would be one way to characterize it and

388
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,980
if you're not on the mailing list<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

389
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,150
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting and ietf things that</font>

390
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,060
might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good way to step into the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">routing side of the IETF so but that's</font>

392
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,510
that's where this belongs Dave Meyer I

393
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,310
think and Vijay maybe actually chair

394
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:46,770
that working group you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a link</font>

395
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,750
to on the IETF web page but other than

396
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:50,670
that that's that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had i want to</font>

397
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,620
thank Craig and<font color="#CCCCCC"> John and bj for a friend</font>

398
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:58,890
put on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation and on the</font>

399
00:13:52,620 --> 00:14:00,900
draft actually and any questions well

400
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:02,640
well Randy's walking I have a question

401
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:05,100
is there anywhere where it's published

402
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:08,250
what vendors do what stupid things with

403
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,680
meds because it's I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> or do you have</font>

404
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,959
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of tease it apart from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

405
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendor yeah i'm not aware you could</font>

406
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,989
maybe it maybe dinner could speak to

407
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,910
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's been teased apart in</font>

408
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:19,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the past and the biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is if</font>

409
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,329
iOS for example did something in one

410
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:23,130
revision you know they do three other

411
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:25,020
things in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve or vision so</font>

412
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:26,700
you know they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting better and</font>

413
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,439
probably probably better defaults but at

414
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,010
the same time you got to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware what's</font>

415
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:35,610
deployed on your network so Randy hood

careful using the network it man on I

422
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,550

423
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,800
this across danny is to start showing

424
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,229
some actual measurements actual trace

425
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:03,959
routes actual disgusting examples and

431
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:15,600
bunch of trade routes at a previous

432
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:18,150
provider i work for and said look you

433
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:21,120
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're taking the least possible i</font>

434
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,189
mean the worst for our customer yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

435
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,440
whole flows are linked but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

436
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,580
so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can do up here to say</font>

show some ya know some of you folks

440
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,900
actually see this this is happening

441
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:39,300
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in your network right i know i</font>

442
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,860
completely agree absolutely so until<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

443
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,180
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same goes actually for the</font>

444
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,130
persistent route oscillation which

445
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,989
actually didn't say a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about the meds</font>

446
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,810
are the primary trigger for persistent

447
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:50,490
round oscillation and and folks are oh

448
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:51,839
it's not hitting me and you know the if

449
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:53,130
they go look you know I mean I one

450
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,690
network I looked at was seeing this with

451
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:56,130
you know over a thousand prefixes in the

452
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,870
network continuously<font color="#E5E5E5"> Austin you know</font>

453
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,150
advertisement for continuously<font color="#CCCCCC"> oscillate</font>

454
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">and and so you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something</font>

455
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,569
until you go look you know yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font>

456
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,740
bothering us we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not seeing it well</font>

457
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's because you're not taking the</font>

458
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,780
time to notice it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Tony Armada</font>

459
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,740
saving<font color="#CCCCCC"> amaral one thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font>

460
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,819
mention is in regard to your aggregation

461
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,490
section that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

462
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,800
regards to meds is there are ways free

463
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:21,930
to not suppress more specific routes

464
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,699
which will still include the med and the

465
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:26,630
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s path when you're</font>

466
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:29,070
aggregating specific routes within bgp

467
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright no no absolutely i'm completely</font>

468
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,430
aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that good but then you know i</font>

469
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,440
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather sell folks to announce</font>

470
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:36,540
aggregates and not punch no punch holes

471
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,280
or announce subsets of aggregates for an

472
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,990
m.ed because you know there are there

473
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,850
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues with accepting more</font>

474
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,830
specifics for aggregates as well and so

475
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:45,150
that's typically like the large folks

476
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:46,620
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that run for you at least it's</font>

477
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:48,329
here one network for their network

478
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,430
aggregates don't like to punch all but

479
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:54,180
yeah all implementations have a mecca

480
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:59,239
absolutely oh yeah any other questions

481
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:59,239
that's it thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> Danny</font>
