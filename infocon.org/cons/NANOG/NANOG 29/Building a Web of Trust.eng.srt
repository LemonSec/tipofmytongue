here today to talk about nothing

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,960
whatsoever to do with ISC this is really

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very brief summary of some issues</font>

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,640
surrounding PGP for those who are not

7
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,380
familiar with it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sort of consumed</font>

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,619
in conjunction with the key signing

party and and with ad hoc<font color="#CCCCCC"> ki signing</font>

10
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may decide to do with other</font>

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,449
people who have red dots on their badges

12
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:28,889
so that's what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about there's</font>

13
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:33,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but groundbreaking here is more</font>

15
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,300
as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of slides here about some</font>

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,920
bad things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened this year this</font>

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,209
is by no means an exhaustive list of all

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
the bad things that happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> July in</font>

19
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">August there's some brief examples there</font>

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,489
was an advisory issued in July for a bug

21
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,160
which had potential to cause widespread

22
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,038
disruption among cisco routers deployed

23
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,050
in the internet and certain operators

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,920
got pre warning of this bug by a couple

25
00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">of days because there was concern that</font>

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,410
if the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> was widely disrupted then</font>

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,000
people wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to download</font>

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,039
patch code in order to upgrade their

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,869
outers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like root server</font>

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,119
operators and large network operators

31
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,890
got some pre warning of exactly what

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,390
this bug was all about some of that was

33
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:14,130
done in face-to-face meetings but a lot

34
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:20,820
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it was down phone calls and by</font>

35
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:22,320
email<font color="#CCCCCC"> so some bad things that happened</font>

36
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,689
in August there was a particular ftp

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,949
server in<font color="#E5E5E5"> calgary which was compromised</font>

38
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,380
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a trojan version of openssh deep the</font>

39
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:33,720
openssh portable<font color="#E5E5E5"> tar ball was loaded</font>

40
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,798
onto that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftp server and that ftp server</font>

41
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,380
is actually the master server for

42
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,329
openssh it's the oft<font color="#CCCCCC"> peter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> openbsd dorg</font>

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,170
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sun side mirror in University</font>

44
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:46,529
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Calgary sometime I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think briefly</font>

45
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,560
before that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> announced the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sff the</font>

46
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,930
FSF announced that ftp<font color="#CCCCCC"> dog had been</font>

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,310
compromised sometime in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March and the</font>

48
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:55,259
fact that it had been compromised hadn't

49
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,119
actually been identified until a week or

50
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,549
two before the<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcement they made in</font>

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,560
August so the potential there was that

52
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,930
software from that ftp server may not

53
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,189
have been genuine as intended by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

54
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,189
people who uploaded it originally

55
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,150
so with those kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> events in mind it</font>

56
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,980
occurred to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it would be nice if</font>

57
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,190

00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,630
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are it also be kind of</font>

62
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:27,069
nice if we could download software and

63
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,239
be confident that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing we actually</font>

64
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:30,220
downloaded was the thing that we

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,630
expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to be and wasn't hadn't been</font>

66
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:38,500
modified somewhere between the developer

67
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:40,000
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine we downloaded onto so in</font>

68
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,989
some wonderful future<font color="#E5E5E5"> universe wouldn't</font>

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,700
it be nice if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could encrypt</font>

conversations with people to discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> ad</font>

destinations for email that are people

years we've never met them before but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

78
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:59,620
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be nice to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to encrypt</font>

79
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,569
things in an ad hoc way and have some

sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of indication that a vaguely</font>

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:10,120
from trivial observation similarly

00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:13,329
transferring customer lists billing data

84
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,680
logs packet captures and things without

85
00:03:13,329 --> 00:03:19,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">having to send them in the clear would</font>

86
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,140
also be an advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes so in</font>

thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this this is these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

88
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,608
the requirements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I came up with the</font>

89
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,768
ability to authenticate the origin of

90
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:29,019
arbitrary data so data signing seems

91
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:30,700
like a good thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we could do it the</font>

92
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to encrypt arbitrary data such</font>

93
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,578
as the plain text will be obscured from

94
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:38,350
casual observation would<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be handy</font>

95
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,370
and presumably we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to be able to</font>

96
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,959
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a way that doesn't make our</font>

heads hurt too far we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want have to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">take aspirin every time we do one of</font>

99
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,970
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and the motivations here</font>

100
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:50,769
are trying to trying not to install

101
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,470
software that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure the origins</font>

102
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:57,910
of particularly software that might be a

103
00:03:52,470 --> 00:04:00,130
some strategic risk to the rest of the

104
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,180
network the many<font color="#E5E5E5"> things depend on one</font>

105
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,680
bit of software it's nice to know that

106
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,410
that software is behaving as we expect

107
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,000
it to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to send secure</font>

108
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,530
email to other people I mean I've worked

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,389
for some some reasonably large network

110
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,440
operators and it's trivial descent where

111
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:13,630
as usual to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of</font>

112
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,950
information by email in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clear</font>

113
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,478
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in the same company</font>

114
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,798
despite the fact that email is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,019
forwarded to all kinds of external

116
00:04:17,798 --> 00:04:20,529
accounts and to wireless devices and all

117
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:22,840
kinds of thing

118
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:24,760
is an even sending internal company<font color="#E5E5E5"> mail</font>

119
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,138
frequently results in mail being sent in

120
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,300
the clear across wireless networks so

121
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:34,720
assuming that internal mail is internal

122
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:36,730
is not usually a good assumption so PGP

123
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,110
for the two or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font>

124
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,540
it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have heard of it his call it</font>

125
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,940
stands to a pretty good privacy it's

126
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,960
originally written by Phil Zimmerman it

127
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,330
was subsequently developed and

128
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:53,169
distributed by other people and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gpg</font>

129
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:56,260
is a compatible free alternative so what

130
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:58,810
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP do pgp includes some key</font>

131
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,669
management tools as well as some tools

132
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,130
to sign and encrypt data so it does the

133
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,719
kinds of things that we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

134
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,930
some modern mail clients have workable

135
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,330
integration of PGP functions into their

136
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:12,040
into the mail client the quality of

137
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,560
those those at that integration varies

138
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,090
greatly and public key servers have

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,250
existed for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they have a</font>

140
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,539
lot of keys on them so some of the

141
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,370
elements for providing this kind of

142
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,020
infrastructure where we can meet some of

143
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">those you know wouldn't it be nice if on</font>

144
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,109
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous slides are already in place</font>

145
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,460
so the other principal feature of PGP is

146
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,680
that it's designed to allow key

147
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,469
distribution by a public non-secure

148
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,240
means while still providing a means to

149
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,789
verify the integrity of keys by those

150
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,120
that want to use them so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is done</font>

151
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:45,010
using signatures so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if a signs be it</font>

152
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,950
implies that a has some level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trust</font>

153
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,030
and the authenticity of B and then we

154
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:51,550
have this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the web of trust</font>

155
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,719
as subsequent<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys assigned by not</font>

156
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,890
necessarily the end users of a

157
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,270
particular conversation so in this

158
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,909
example here<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I want to send some mail</font>

159
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:02,680
to rob and i want a pgp sign it or<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

160
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,930

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,729

some sort of confidence<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i have is</font>

163
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:11,919
key through some secure exchange if

164
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,810
there's a chain of trust through the

165
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">subject intermediary keys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can gain</font>

166
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,110
some degree of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust in the key that I</font>

167
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,120
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use to talk to rob without</font>

169
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,510
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> or anything like that so if</font>

170
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,720
there's a chain of trust from a key that

171
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:27,310
I trust which is my key to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rob's key</font>

172
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,900
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know anything about we can</font>

173
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,550
establish trust through this through

174
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,700
this pattern here paths through this web

175
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,180
of trust a frequently asymmetric so if

176
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,669
Rob wants

177
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,500
send a reply the keys that he looks at

178
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">and his hearing to determine whether he</font>

179
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:43,229
trusts<font color="#E5E5E5"> my key might be different to the</font>

180
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:46,180
a B and C keys on this diagram here and

181
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:48,099
path diversity here is good because for

182
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:51,610
example if<font color="#CCCCCC"> ki see in this diagram</font>

183
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,720
becomes compromised or useless<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font>

184
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,490
other way or I discovered that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

185
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,500
person responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> key C is more or</font>

186
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:58,000
less signs<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything for fun and the</font>

187
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,340
actual trust implied in that is not

188
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,539
great it's nice to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have another</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path so</font>

189
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:08,739
I can avoid using key C so there are

190
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,360
lots of operators in the world and the

191
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:11,889
chances of meeting all the operators you

192
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,220
might ever want to send ad hoc mail to

193
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:17,500
in a single meeting is close to zero but

194
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:21,220
however the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who do go</font>

195
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:23,169
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of meetings provide some sort of</font>

196
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,580
relatively small path distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> through</font>

197
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:26,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the web of trust if people routinely</font>

198
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:30,370
assigned keys and kept the keys up to

199
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:31,509
date so as it says here<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a large</font>

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,160
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who know somebody does</font>

00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">building a web of trust which is dense</font>

204
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:41,289
and reliable doesn't seem like a

205
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,430
completely unreasonable idea it's not

206
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:44,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">like you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to meet</font>

207
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,000
everybody you ever at every company you

want exchange mail with in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to be</font>

209
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,930
able to use PGP as long as there are

210
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:55,930
some degree of key signing happening on

211
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:57,729
a regular basis so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for all these</font>

212
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,930
positive aspects things like we have the

213
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:01,330
software installed and we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

214
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:04,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">use it and we can find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> public keys from</font>

215
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,800
key servers we can verify signatures and

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,449
we also happen to be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to somebody</font>

217
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">else who has published a public key and</font>

218
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:11,560
also has PGP software installed and

knows how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can also find keys</font>

220
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:19,000
for us and intermediate keys there are

221
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:20,650
still some issues we rarely have a good

222
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,159
way of verifying that the public keys we

223
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,239
have found are in fact the right ones

224
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:26,620
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of keys you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can find for</font>

225
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and lots of key servers</font>

226
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,090
which have either different<font color="#E5E5E5"> origins from</font>

227
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,169
the person you think made those keys or

228
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:34,029
they were made by people who

229
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:37,299
subsequently lost their secret key and

230
00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:38,919
can no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer use that key people's keys</font>

231
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:40,179
expire people<font color="#CCCCCC"> frequently think it's a</font>

232
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:41,828
good idea if I put a key on the key

233
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,419
server particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I've already</font>

234
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:44,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">had an experience where I lost my secret</font>

235
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,199
key and therefore can no longer use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

236
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,069
key<font color="#E5E5E5"> and can no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> longer revoke it I'll put</font>

237
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,500
a time

238
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,420
on my key so Mikey will<font color="#E5E5E5"> expire in two</font>

239
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,680
years and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look on the key servers</font>

240
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,990
there's a very large<font color="#CCCCCC"> number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of keys</font>

241
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,819
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the only keys for</font>

242
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,200
individuals are expired keys because

243
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are not renewing their keys and</font>

244
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,600
re uploading them to the key servers an

245
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,890
expired key of course infer some lower

246
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,980
level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trust and perhaps you might</font>

247
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">like and the other thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the public</font>

248
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,330
key servers are public so anybody can

249
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:15,280
upload keys anybody can upload a key to

250
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,020
the MIT cue server called<font color="#CCCCCC"> jab we at ASCO</font>

251
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,930
org and there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop them</font>

252
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,520
doing it so relying purely on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

253
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,560
tag on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key on the email</font>

254
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:27,150
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to infer trust is a bad</font>

255
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,150
idea you need that web of trust so

256
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's an example of where some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

257
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,140
pieces fit together and yet the result

258
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,550
is not exactly satisfying so this ftp

259
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,949
site here at the top that some people

260
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,329
may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen before and there's a</font>

261
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,530
software called by nine so in this

262
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,880
example we're going to download<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

263
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,770
software called by nine and we're going

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of try and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verify that the thing</font>

265
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:49,000
we download it is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact the thing we</font>

266
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,339
expected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find so we download the</font>

267
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,450
thing from ftp this ftp site we download

268
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:57,430
the detached signature<font color="#E5E5E5"> JSC file and then</font>

269
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,350
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use gpg to try and verify that that</font>

270
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,189
signature does in fact sign that data so

271
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,570
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data in the signature correspond so</font>

272
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,790
it turns out that's what you type gpg

273
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:09,910
minus minus verify on the top use his

274
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,800
mouth put there so we found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

275
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,890
signature file we downloaded corresponds

276
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,630
to the tarball that we expect was used

277
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:20,080
to generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that signature and we found</font>

278
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key on a public key server and that</font>

279
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,720
also matches it so that makes us feel

280
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,300
good and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but at the end</font>

281
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the day what did we prove we don't</font>

282
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,209
actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any trust that that key we</font>

283
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,850
downloaded from the public key server is

284
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,010
in fact the real key we know that it

285
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,540
matches those other things we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

286
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,850
the tarball signed with that key that we

287
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,230
don't trust was signed reliably with

288
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,420
that key because we downloaded both them

289
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,070
together and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signature matched but</font>

290
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,599
if ftp dot is Sita August being

291
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,310

296
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,079
it is what they bind developers actually

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually published so what's missing</font>

298
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,430
here is that web of trust the chain of

304
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,730
expand to finish the<font color="#CCCCCC"> job and satisfy</font>

305
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:18,850
some of the requirements in the earlier

306
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:21,070
slide we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> encourage people with</font>

307
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,050
whom we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk to actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

308
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,839
the effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> to install PGP software and</font>

309
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,760
use it and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand it because</font>

310
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:29,770
even if we have a web of trust if the

311
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,060
other sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible endpoints of that</font>

00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,399
path through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web of trust are</font>

313
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:37,029
vanishingly small you know only<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% of</font>

314
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,350
operators have a published key then we

315
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,450
only have a solution for talking to one

316
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,050
percent of operators and that's that 99

317
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,580
percent useless people should sign

318
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,140
software so people can verify<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

319
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,279
hasn't been tampered<font color="#E5E5E5"> with because even</font>

320
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:50,589
if we have a web of trust that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

321
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,529
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not signed obviously we</font>

322
00:11:50,589 --> 00:11:55,360
can't verify anything uploading<font color="#CCCCCC"> Keys</font>

323
00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:59,080
regularly and signatures to key servers

324
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,700
needs to happen try to renew keys to

325
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,020
make sure they don't expire it also has

326
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,820
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen if all the keys are expired</font>

327
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:06,370
then again the situation is nest and

328
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:12,010
helpful and strengthen and expand your

329
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:14,709
personal web of trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

330
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,560
signing economics is concerned if you if

331
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,729
your key has signed a lot of other keys

332
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,189
then that's a useful key for people to

333
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,170
know because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a useful sort of node</font>

334
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,910
and then that directed graph of trust

335
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:28,180
which allows us to reach many other

336
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:30,069
endpoint keys so if I trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> your key I</font>

337
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,079
will sign it and have lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

338
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign your key path to your key will be</font>

339
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,189
short and diverse and it's easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

340
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:38,440
so the greater the path density in the

341
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:40,089
past diversity through the web of trust

342
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,470
from your key to other people's keys and

343
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:43,500
in both directions because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

344
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,000
asymmetric the more useful your key is

345
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,040
and the more likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is you can send</font>

346
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,630
mail to other people that's encrypted

347
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,760
and the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely it is other people</font>

348
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,950
can send mail to you and as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

349
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,310
sending mail if you're a software vendor

350
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:59,050
or a free software publisher same thing

351
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,209
the more likely your key<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to be able</font>

352
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:04,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk securely and with a degree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

353
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:05,439
trust to other keys the more<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely it</font>

354
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:08,430
is that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> signature on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tab all</font>

355
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,430
will be useful to somebody

356
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:15,100
so here at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting we have red dots</font>

357
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,420
on badges and if you don't have a red

358
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,560
dot and you would like one there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

359
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,199
guessing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> more at the registration</font>

360
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,699
desk I'm sure there's lots there so if

361
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:25,270
you see somebody with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a red dot on their</font>

362
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,710
name tag that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means I sign keys so if</font>

363
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,990
you go out to a person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a red dot</font>

364
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,780
and you get them a copy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your public</font>

365
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:34,330
key fingerprint which is a small ASCII

366
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:35,500
string of hex digits quite small I have

367
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,260
light on the business card lets people

368
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,610
do that allows them if they know that

369
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and believe you are who you say you are</font>

370
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,580
to somehow later look at the fingerprint

371
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:44,050
for the key that they obtained from

372
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,750
somewhere else like a key server and

373
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,979
verify that it's the right key and if

374
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,360
they put a signature on that key that

375
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,490
means they and other people who trust

376
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,850
their signatures can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then infer that</font>

377
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,710
trust at later times so if somebody

378
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:58,180
gives the fingerprint to you and you are

379
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,100
confident you know who they are you can

380
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,359
sign their key so this sort of thing can

381
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,250
happen in corridors just by looking at

382
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,780
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> with red dots on the badges it</font>

383
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:06,780
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be at a organized event</font>

384
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,440
the other thing at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting we have</font>

385
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:14,890
is a key signing party which is tonight

386
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:19,120
9pm in<font color="#E5E5E5"> salim f after the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bath is</font>

387
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:20,380
finished and that URL there contains

388
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,270
some information about the key signing

389
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:23,710
party which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of more organized</font>

390
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,800
group event corresponding to the

391
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:28,480
corridor event so if you send if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,189
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in participating the website</font>

393
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,890
actually says you should send your

00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:34,570
asking armored keys to me before six

395
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">before noon which only gives you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten</font>

397
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:48,400
a more reasonable deadline so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Jay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Elliott is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero or guitar</font>

you there as you turn up at the key

400
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:51,640
signing meeting and your your

401
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:53,440
fingerprint is not on the list which I'm

402
00:14:51,640 --> 00:15:02,199
not on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheet how do you know that</font>

403
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:04,470
well nevermind and that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end thank</font>

404

you very much
