1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
thank you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about the last and</font>

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:10,320
second to last I do<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,629
second to last presenter and I've gotta

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,519
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you a little story about that so</font>

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,930
there was a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd this conference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,529
was speaking at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous time and</font>

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:24,090
why was the second to last speaker and

8
00:00:21,529 --> 00:00:25,920
you know it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the conference</font>

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,259
and it's you know the second day just

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,789
like it is here and towards in of the

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,160
conference more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people of</font>

12
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,739
leaving and at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know</font>

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,379
i'm left with one person was you know

14
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,410
very graciously sitting through my

15
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:41,579
presentation and and at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I</font>

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,440
go up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him and tell him well you</font>

17
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">really had no reason to sit here because</font>

18
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,579
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nobody else that he could go to</font>

19
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">be presenting to and then he does me</font>

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:56,879
well I'm the present or after you so

21
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:58,289
haha so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> glad to see such a big</font>

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,718
turnout here I appreciate your tenacity

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,449
and sitting through this and we'll try

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to keep the shot so my name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a Shankar</font>

25
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rao and i work at quest I've been there</font>

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,510
for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few years I worked there in their</font>

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,240
engineering team and I'm here today I

28
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,939
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> it Scott beretsky scott and i have</font>

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,860
been collaborating on some work at the

30
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,320
benchmarking methodology working group

31
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,350
in the IETF that is concerned with the

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,779
stress testing core routers so we just

33
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,908
walk you through briefly with what we're

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,670
trying to do and I'm hoping we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

35
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,990
some feedback and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas from this</font>

36
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,360
operator community here about what is

37
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,839
right for us to kind of include in this

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,520
work item as well so Before we jump to

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,380
the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is an agenda I</font>

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,089
quickly give you a brief background

41
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,920
about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of benchmarking</font>

42
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,750
methodology working group and we'll talk

43
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,189
about the accelerated stress testing

44
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:49,530
item that the working group is currently

45
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,630
working on we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking to whatever</font>

46
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,670
terminology and the framework of what

47
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,140
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and Scott's not talk</font>

48
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:56,130
about the methodology and we're going to

49
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,979
conclude with summary and

50
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,600
recommendations so the benchmarking

51
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,179
mythology working group this is this

52
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,059
fall some of the operations area so it

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,830
does concern you know folks in this room

54
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,690
there's a

55
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:10,669
there is some operational impacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

56
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">work that's done there and most of the</font>

57
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:15,109
work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done there relates</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

58
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,170
making accommodations about measuring

59
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:22,880
performance characteristics of equipment

60
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">networking equipment the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> benchmarking</font>

61
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,690
work is usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> related devices the</font>

62
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,450
networks of not doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the end-to-end</font>

63
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of things there and that's a link</font>

64
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,869
for the working group charter so if

65
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:36,830
anybody's interested you can look that

66
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,540
up so the stress tests work item that

67
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:41,480
the working group is currently

68
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:44,690
considering there are a couple of those

69
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,880
work items that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there and the the</font>

70
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,760
this work item is basically concerned

71
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,990
with providing the framework terminology

72
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,429
guidelines and a methodology for

73
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:58,040
providers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment vendors to</font>

74
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,970
perform stress testing so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

75
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,060
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know is a</font>

76
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:04,070
collaborative effort you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we hope to</font>

77
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,530
get more input from the community and

78
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:09,950
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of standardized how we can test for</font>

79
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:12,380
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roderick routers before we</font>

80
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,790
actually deployed them in the network so

81
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:15,859
before we actually jump in the

82
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:17,359
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to define some</font>

83
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,260
terms I'm sure all of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard this</font>

84
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,269
before but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to get us on you know</font>

85
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,700
just to for the sake of the contributing

86
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:27,709
the presentation d UT device under test

87
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,470
so this is basically the device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

88
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">being evaluated white box was black box</font>

89
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,510
most of the testing that we do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

90
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,950
that we that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at in the benchmark</font>

91
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">my group is comes with black box testing</font>

92
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:41,630
so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at external</font>

93
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,100
manifestations of problems we don't

94
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily look at what's happening in</font>

95
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,150
the router in terms of memory and CPU

96
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,040
ttle ization although as operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

97
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,500
sure we're all you know interested in

98
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,209
understanding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact there as well</font>

99
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,700
stress testing so stress testing is

100
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:57,410
basically this concept of will dig into

101
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,260
it in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more detail but the idea</font>

102
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,959
here is to evaluate router behavior

103
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:04,370
under stress so this isn't in a

104
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just testing for functionality</font>

105
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:09,049
and saying does the router conform to a

106
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,730
particular protocol but how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

107
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,650
behave under stress when there are

108
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,540
multiple protocols running on the

109
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,340
particular router<font color="#CCCCCC"> in stability</font>

110
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">conditions I'm sure you're all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar</font>

111
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:20,728
with what that means real

112
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,830
networks do have instability conditions

113
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:25,289
in them whether these are links flapping

114
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,300
or interfaces going down or routing

115
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:29,849
protocols you know converging you to

116
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,240
other events in the network and for the

117
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:34,949
purpose of the framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the model</font>

118
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,889
of how we propose it stress testing work

119
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:41,639
item we basically divided you know the

120
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:44,220
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inputs sorted into to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> d UT so to</font>

121
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,110
speak into data control security and

122
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,370
management<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane so data plane you're</font>

123
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:50,310
all very familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this terminology</font>

124
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:53,009
and what we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we define what are</font>

125
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,530
called configuration sets so a

126
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:57,900
configuration set basically defines how

127
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,059
the data plane needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know</font>

128
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">stressed how the control plane is be</font>

129
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,729
stressed for example and the control

130
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,009
plane many of you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be running</font>

131
00:05:05,729 --> 00:05:10,740
multiple routing protocols such as bgp

132
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I Assize and NDP and RSVP and</font>

133
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,570
anything else that you need to run your

134
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,130
particular network so that particular

135
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,280
configuration set with is that will

136
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:23,070
define a starting condition so to speak

137
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,429
for for for a particular you know

138
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,020
benchmark or for a benchmarking test and

139
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the evaluation benchmarks you know</font>

140
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,620
how to be exactly measure pass and fail

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,800
again based on from from a specification

142
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,630
standpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> blackbox behavior but also</font>

143
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,500
from an operational standpoint you know

144
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:46,380
what is the box<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing so a wise</font>

145
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,630
stress stressing important now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

146
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,729
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all smarter than this but</font>

147
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of testing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we typically see</font>

148
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:54,180
is testing of that there's done a

149
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,970

00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing running there and then you say</font>

156
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:14,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">do the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing for different</font>

really doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you how the router</font>

174
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,010
might perform and you have multiple

00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,480
routing protocols that are actually

176
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:58,460
stressing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box in an operational</font>

178
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,120
know there are in stability conditions

179
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:04,070
in your network so it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font>

180
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">know these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are all protocols</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come up and</font>

181
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,550
everybody's happy that there are things

that occur in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network which might</font>

184
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:17,870
potential failures so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font>

185
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,669
idea here is x value by deploying or by

186
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:22,280
using this particular methodology to

187
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:23,930
stress as routers before you deploy they

<font color="#E5E5E5">seeing in your network so we just talked</font>

196
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,060
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:51,520
might test a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> order a switch</font>

200
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:53,930
but not necessarily stress testing it so

201
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,450
this slide basically presents a stress

202
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:58,310
test model so what we have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we</font>

203
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:00,800
got the router<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the switch which is a</font>

204
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:04,700
device under test and we got all these

205
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,220
map is the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> modules the</font>

206
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,590
management security data and control

207
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,200
plane modules that are kind of

208
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:15,049
pre-configured to a particular you know

209
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,570
threshold that might reflect what a

210
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,330
network might be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> at under normal</font>

211
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,340
conditions and then what we do is we

212
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,590
introduce these<font color="#E5E5E5"> instability conditions</font>

213
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so those instability conditions</font>

214
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,989
might include things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP route</font>

215
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:31,719
slapping<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp roads flapping you know LSP</font>

216
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,060
we routes occurring for various reasons

217
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:37,909
and you know not actually the data plane

218
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,959
going down itself so so each of those

219
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:43,150
planes may have you know

220
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,820
configuration said that is defined like

221
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:48,430
like I said earlier so the data play

222
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,380
might have you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got X number</font>

223
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:53,079
of line cards of certain type and

224
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,610
they're running at a certain speed so

225
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,620
that you know the router is actually

226
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,930
stressed a little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

227
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,690
data plane or the security plane you

228
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,760
might you may have a CS and things like

229
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,900
that they're also defined and on the

230
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,060
control plane you may have multiple

231
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,069
routing protocols again each of those

232
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:12,430
running at you know different levels of

233
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,410
scale and what is also very important of

234
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,699
course is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when these routers are</font>

235
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,140
doing all these things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

236
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,480
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do which is route packets</font>

237
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,270
you're also able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to manage it so you</font>

238
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,500
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to for example a</font>

239
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,090
associate sessions and you know do your

240
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,160
SNMP logging and anything else that you

241
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:29,200
might want to do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that you</font>

242
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,410
build your customer reserve or you know

243
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,600
manage the network so some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

244
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,480
stress stress measurements what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

245
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,130
help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify one thing that they</font>

246
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,830
that we believe it'll help us you know

<font color="#E5E5E5">more quickly identify be memory leaks a</font>

when we have constant route withdrawals

251
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,500
and updates and things like that you

252
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you may not immediately see a</font>

00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,140
you keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this and we've all seen</font>

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:01,810
this in different in our order

256
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,340

262
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:20,320
also the impact on or the stress testing

263
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:22,750
for cpu utilization the other thing

there about<font color="#E5E5E5"> CP utilization is mean we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">CPU are different you know conditions so</font>

273
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,430
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that'll help you benchmark that</font>

274
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:48,370
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know an environment as well</font>

275
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,319
as well as multi-protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> coding logic</font>

276
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,870
so you know if you have a router that's

277
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,990
just running bgp and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> size everything</font>

278
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be doing it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

279
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:57,440
perfectly happy in doing everything well

280
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,870
but if you introduce some other ordering

281
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,200
protocols and and then have the router

282
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:05,120
kind of operate under under stress we're

283
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,950
not quite sure that you know it'll

284
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">operate as as ideal as defined so we</font>

285
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,640
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be some more</font>

know network failures occur there are

these talks about how we can make these

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,300
is you know really operating under with

limited set of resources with limited

306
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,500
sort of memory and limited you know

307
00:11:57,589 --> 00:12:01,700
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of CPU cycles so do you</font>

308
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:06,079
see the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of convergence</font>

309
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:08,839

some of the benchmarks of the stress

about the importance of stress testing

how by doing stress testing and making

352

subsequent fixes in routing devices we

353
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,160
create more stable routers we create

354
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,550
more stable protocols we also create

355
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,160
routers that are more survivable two

under stress are these routers

manageable under stress shankar's also

361
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,370
talked to us about the stress testing

362
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:31,250
model it's a big test we admitted this

363
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:34,100
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so to</font>

364
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:36,830
simplify it we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created separate blocks</font>

365
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,160
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model where you have your you</font>

366
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:42,080
have your control plane management plane

367
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,329
security plane and data plane you break

368
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,660
those down separately you can create

369
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,820
your configuration sets your instability

370
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,459
conditions and your failure conditions

371
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:55,850
for each of those planes so modeling it

372
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:57,740
like that simplifies the test you do

373
00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:00,020
have failure when this test is running

374

380
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,020
control plane failure by a session loss

381
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:22,110
on the data plane we can see misrouted

lost or reordered packets on the

383
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:27,630

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:35,910
to actually manage it or do we see

387
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,360
something as simple as value errors

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain threshold of time that you set</font>

403
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,540

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and your requirements</font>

413
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,089
what's important to note here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

414
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:48,030
you can do multiple iterations of this

415
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:50,790
test to characterize the device under

416
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:53,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">test so you can pick your certain values</font>

417
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,219
and monitor your CPU utilization memory

418
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,220
utilization and look for those failures

419
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,260
if you have a pass or a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

420
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,930
can tweak the numbers create<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

421
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,970
configuration sets and then do new

422

iterations of the test multiple

423
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,310
iterations gives you that full

424
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:13,680
characterization so what will<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

425
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,329
while the stress test is running well

426
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,130
with all these instability conditions

427
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,859
were doing and just in review will look

428
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:21,329
down there there's route flaps on BGP

429
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:24,240
igp MP

430
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:27,959
less reroutes you can do cycling of

431
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,419
interface shutdowns you can have links

432
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:31,769
with more than one hundred percent

your box crashes well with this

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,990
this in hours instead of weeks or months

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the next thing is you're going to</font>

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:53,519
is fast rear out fail overs may also

476
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,629
you need to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure you're picking the</font>

one or the fourth best one under stress

479
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:23,070
conditions and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last piece which</font>

480
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:25,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">is important for management is to ensure</font>

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:36,969
okay so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said there is a lot going</font>

485
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,759
on here<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are specific testable</font>

486
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,440
requirements to do all of this the first

487
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,090
one is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to emulate multiple</font>

488
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,460
protocols simultaneously on the same

interface it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely on the same</font>

490
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:52,179
interface you're going to have BGP is is

491
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">ldp and maybe even mpls te so your test</font>

492
00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:56,350
device needs to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

493
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to send and measure</font>

494
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,639
traffic in which the destination

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:03,309
addresses of that traffic matches the

496
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:05,799
emulated routes and LSPs that you've

497
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:08,678
advertised you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

498
00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,210
perform SNMP you need to do your gets

499
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,149
and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to do value</font>

500
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:15,669
checking on those gets and then the the

501
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:17,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">fourth one is the instability conditions</font>

502
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:21,159
you need your test equipment to actually

503
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:24,429
go and initiate repeatable route session

504
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,500
and Link flaps<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a system</font>

505
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:28,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">level on your test equipment you need</font>

protocol emulation on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a variety</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

507
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">different interfaces being a pause ATM</font>

508

frame relay<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gigabit Ethernet you also</font>

509
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:37,779
need high port density on those<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

510
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,908
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a lot of interfaces</font>

511
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,379
on your device like you will when you

512
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:43,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">deploy this box you're going to</font>

513
00:20:41,379 --> 00:20:45,820
hopefully use a lot of the interfaces on

514
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:48,340
the box and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this test</font>

515
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,470
device needs to work under stress the

516
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,500
stress testing is only successful if the

517
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:58,210
test device itself can work under stress

518
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:59,769
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will be stressed okay so those</font>

519
00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,210
are the requirements what do we have for

520
00:20:59,769 --> 00:21:03,700
limitations and commercial test

521
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,769
equipment there there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few for</font>

522
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,389
various vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> it may differ as to</font>

523
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:11,110
which one it is but I can guarantee<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

524
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:15,699
now no one no one will support three out

525
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:18,428
of the five will support more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

526
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:21,879
4 out of 5 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 out of 5 of that list of</font>

527
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:24,519
common limitations because of that there

528
00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:27,549
is the need for test engineers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

529
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:29,559
lab to actually build their own tools to

530
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:32,110
go do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this or use freeware like a</font>

531
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,970
freeware tool that does SNMP<font color="#CCCCCC"> MIT walks</font>

532
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,789
for example so let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through these</font>

533
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,490
establishing multiple protocols on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

534
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:42,009
same interface direct traffic to

emulated routes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and LSPs induced</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">heatable configurable race perform SNMP</font>

538
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:51,400

539
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you right now that none of the testicle</font>

540
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,590
IP test equipment vendors does SNMP none

541
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,990
so you automatically right off the bat

542
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,149
there need another tool that's that's

543
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:04,570
bad for us the people who need to run

544
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">this test because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it complicates the</font>

545
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,710
automation of these tests if all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

546
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,320
functionality for these tests all these

features<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist on the same test device</font>

548
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:15,220
then it's much<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to automate if</font>

549
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,529
they're all on different test devices

<font color="#E5E5E5">really complicates the automation so</font>

552
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,149
that's something we really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

553
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">then also it needs to be stable when</font>

554
00:22:25,149 --> 00:22:28,928
actually introducing the instability

555
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:33,220
conditions and running multiple

556
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:35,230
protocols for continuous hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

557
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:38,950
we have summary and recommendations

558
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:41,049
first one is summary stress testing is

559
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:43,029
very important because it enhances our

560
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:44,850
router test and evaluation for

561
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:47,799

we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have memory leaks and survive</font>

575
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,428
through all this flapping than we know

576
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:23,620
that this router can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

577
00:23:21,429 --> 00:23:25,809
we also validate we're picking the right

578
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,969
next tops with all these convergence

579
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:30,879
events and the nested convergence events

580
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:33,460
we also verify that the device is in

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,950
manage the device and have access maybe

584
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:44,110
even we can do a logging and debug under

stress and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also find the</font>

00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,789
difficult to detect software bugs that's

587
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:50,440
more important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the test equipment</font>

588
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:52,600
vendors rather than the service

589
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,760
providers but we make sure we catch

590
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,260
those slow memory leaks real early<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

591
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,620
we can

demise CPU utilization ok so the

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,969
ultimate benefits were ready<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

594
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,800
deployment we see higher availability of

595
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:07,280
the routers in the network our protocols

596
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:10,230
are more stable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we can withstand</font>

597
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,620
potential das attacks that are aimed at

00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:15,120
resource exhaustion so<font color="#E5E5E5"> given all that</font>

599
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,219
what are our recommendations for

everybody the first one is for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

601
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,010
router vendors to actually now use this

602
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:26,180
so they have a determined that can

603
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:30,270
create deterministic software repeatable

604
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:32,490
tests and repeatable results from the

605
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:35,639
stress testing so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is of value to</font>

606
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:38,250
the service providers from that the

607
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,990
router vendors can assess the

608
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:43,520
interaction of protocols working

609
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,990
together and not and give us now real

615
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:00,600
numbers are when all this stuff is

616
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,040
working together and it's stable so we

617
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,110
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now from the router vendors</font>

using the stress testing the test

619
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,899
equipment vendors have to put in all of

620
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:11,550
those features all of them as I just

621
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:14,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">listed them and then the service</font>

622
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:16,620
providers can employ this for

623
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,350
certification testing for better

624
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:22,679
deployment and then they can also use

625
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:25,010
this for characterization<font color="#E5E5E5"> of devices so</font>

626
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:27,750
they can plan future deployments of

networking devices in the network you

628

run multiple iterations you can

characterize devices that gives you

weeks or so thank you for bringing meta

any other questions that's it it's that

everybody's doing this who's everybody

stress testing every service providers

doing the stress testing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do I just wanted to make a</font>

674
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:29,120
observationally and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the things</font>

675
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was expressed as a concern was</font>

676
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,449
because there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so many things that</font>

677
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,320
are going on in<font color="#CCCCCC"> these routers now we've</font>

678
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,600
got all these different routing

679
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:37,460
protocols doing different things there

680
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,469
was a concern expressed that these tests

681
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,870
may not be repeatable that the results

682
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:43,640
may be variable and in fact that is

683
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,040
probably true for most of our routers

684
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:47,780
today and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually concerning</font>

685
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,700
because if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we cannot</font>

686
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,520
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have repeatable test with</font>

687
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:54,620
repeatable results you know you know to

688
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,270
really order deployed boxes that we

689
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:58,520
can't do it I mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't run</font>

690
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,710
such tests on so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

693
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:08,120
that better and maybe get our vendors

694
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,879
also you know on the bandwagon go ahead

695
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,719
thank you Tony capella server central

696
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,070
one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't asking you when</font>

697
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,710
you're mentioning that you will set up

698
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,780
test scenarios with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2,000 i believe</font>

699
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,500
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the figure of flows of active</font>

700
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,030
traffic through the device what

701
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:25,170
packages or software tools are using to

702
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:26,460
create flow level traffic patterns for

703
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:28,770
the for the purpose of the particular

704
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:32,490
specification we haven't really defined

705
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,900
which device<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Mike use this is just a</font>

706
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,850
framework documents that we don't

707
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:38,430
necessarily prescribe that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use this</font>

708
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,469
vendor or that vendor it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

709
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:42,060
framework where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> substitute water</font>

710
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,600
numbers are more secular to reflect your

711
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,730
environment understood thank you and I

712
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">would like to add that the two thousand</font>

713
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:51,660
was just an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in the</font>

714
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,370
framework document we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

715
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,890
specify the exact value but for the

716
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:58,709
purposes here we gave an example value

717
00:28:55,890 --> 00:29:01,820
sure if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could mention also wearing the</font>

718
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:04,410
flow issue or the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mentioned</font>

719
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:06,149
when you're doing the stress testing it

720
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,680
seems as 2,000 might just be an average

721
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:12,390
baseline what would you consider

722
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:14,310
stressful<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10,000 one on 120 or more sure</font>

723
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:18,690
so you can do that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> your look okay</font>

724
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:20,399
thank you you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention them this</font>

basis or do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we really</font>

731
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,200
need some<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party thing that's</font>

732
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:32,640
incorporated to do this and it's tied

733
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,640
into the insurance industry and do you

734
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,830
process when things go wrong I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

735
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:41,700
is your I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like the idea because geez</font>

736
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:44,460
maybe it could make us money but<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

737
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,650
you so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing this on our free</font>

738
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:50,190
time in the IETF as everybody else who

739
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:52,410
contributes in the IETF is doing right

740
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,480
now we don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a third-party lab</font>

741
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,550
that's doing it in any of the stress

742
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,520
testing but we're hoping once this does

743
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,200
become RFC that that will motivate one

744
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the many third-party labs to actually</font>

745
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,110
go out there and make this part of their

746
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:11,010
product line we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't then</font>

747
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:14,010
gone to any of them I don't know how

748
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:15,750
that ties into the IETF process<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

749
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think there is any vehicle</font>

750
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:20,820
for to go direct from IETF to a place

751
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">like underwriters lab but you know maybe</font>

752
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:26,700
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

753
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:30,169
