understand what's meant by owned right

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:25,619
that means somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you controls</font>

7
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,910
your resources and your network and can

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,160
do whatever they want with it which

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:32,730
probably isn't what you want with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or</font>

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,469
your customers want with it so we have

responsibly and keep the problems down

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:22,380
and then George<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jones</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mitre will tell</font>

features we need in those routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um</font>

31
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:49,320
and I think we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of time and so</font>

32
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,689
I suggest you know if you want to argue

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,169
where you have questions or so just kind

34

says I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scare you a little bit</font>

53
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,049
actually I'm not setting out to scare

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I hope it does shock you a</font>

58
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,700
going on that's the part that's probably

59
00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:34,580
going to scare you a little bit next

60
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,010
slide please so my caffeinated

61
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,450
commentary for today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk</font>

62
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,950
about in the beginning where did this

63
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,958
start why did people start owning

64
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:44,570
routers what benefit do they get from

65
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,549
that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about no lazy</font>

66
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:49,090
Cisco's how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have cisco</font>

67
00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:53,930
routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> have fifty percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CPU or less</font>

68
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:55,880
yeah the miscreants love you motives of

69
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:58,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">the modern miscreant why do they do this</font>

70
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,359
as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about why you should secure</font>

71
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,579
this stuff it's all about resource

72
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,790
allocation go to your management hey I

73
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,959
need time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure the routers why so</font>

74
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,480
I'm gonna help you answer that question

75
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:10,250
and then it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true I never shut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up but i</font>

76
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,608
will try to give some final thoughts to

77
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:16,370
you randy has kindly given me 15 minutes

78
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:21,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">and i'm going to take all 25 of them</font>

79
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:25,220
so a startling discovery<font color="#CCCCCC"> dawn of an era</font>

80
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:27,320
a large broadband provider that is

81
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,970
likely represented here today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:32,750
get a t-shirt so he<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't beat me up</font>

83
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,479
in the parking<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot deployed a bunch of</font>

84
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:38,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">caiman broadband routers to their end</font>

85
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,979
users and apparently they had some

86
00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:42,800
mix-up because they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

87
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:45,020
architecture discussions about what sort

88
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,300
of passwords to put on these routers and

89
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,940
then how to manage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> change every 30</font>

90
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:52,280
days what have you so they came up with

91
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:55,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">a brilliant solution if you don't have a</font>

92
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:59,750
password you never forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you don't</font>

93
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,820
have to change it it's easy my guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

94
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,870
it took the miscreants probably 15

95
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,000
minutes to discover this little feature

96
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:11,750
so they discover the Cayman router they

97
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,900
discover two things one no passwords to

98
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,970
no monitoring they were owning these

99
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:21,320
things on a massive scale scanning like

100
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,760
crazy for TCP 23 no one noticed they get

101
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:27,050
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> these routers and they find</font>

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:29,620
something really cool on pain it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

103
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:33,440
of a neat tool lots of thing not so neat

104
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:36,860
so they start writing scripts to manage

105
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,729
several hundred or thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these to</font>

106
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:46,190
send a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of packet love to him you</font>

107
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:48,919
discern a pic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tanya so they start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

108
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:54,169
understand the power this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is their term</font>

109
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:56,359
bot power of teamwork well something

110
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:59,719
interesting happened this guy right here

111
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:04,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll teach you not to pay attention had</font>

112
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:06,289
a thousand Caymans this guy had<font color="#CCCCCC"> do this</font>

113
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:10,130
guy talk smack to that guy he<font color="#E5E5E5"> package</font>

114
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:12,199
him out of existence that's not good but

115
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,909
he finds something out this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy may have</font>

116
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,729
a thousand he's got a pretty mad lead

117
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:18,840
scan employed script but he doesn't set

118
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:21,300
a password

119
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,880
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce you to the free</font>

120
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:26,460
security service you're all getting it's

121
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,190
the miscreant security service he goes

122
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,760
Jack's all of his<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caymans Jack Steele</font>

123
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,080
and sets a password on him of course now

124
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:39,479
the ice piece problems are solved to

125
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,430
write so they go through their owning

126
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,680
these their packaging boom but they have

127
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,290
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem the Caymans were never</font>

128
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,479
designed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> war boss and therefore</font>

129
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,460
fortunately and therefore ping

130
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,590
themselves out<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off line are</font>

131
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:57,150
difficult to manage what are you gonna

132
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:58,739
do next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> please you find Cisco for</font>

133

those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you who would besmirch Cisco</font>

134
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,100
let me tell you a cisco is a great

135
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:06,570
packaging device so the miscreants are

136
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,000
out there scanning and remember this

137
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">game for TCP 23 they're finding all</font>

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,710
kinds of stuff right well one miscreant

139
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:17,070
finds he keeps seeing this certain

140
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,239
prompt over and over so he goes he does

141
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:21,479
a little digging finds out oh it's a

142
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,360
cisco router I wonder what password it

143
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:30,389
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisc oh he's in that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool</font>

144
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,770
and he could ping that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> even cooler but</font>

145
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">then somebody says oh you know you can</font>

146
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:35,549
make configuration changes and stuff but

147
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:39,930
you have to have an able I wonder what

148
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:44,820
the enable password is any<font color="#E5E5E5"> guesses great</font>

149
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:47,210
crop great crowd you get a shirt so they

150
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:51,210
find out that they can do extended ping

151
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:53,400
from thousands of routers so now it's

152
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the little 64 byte packet love hey</font>

153
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,280
how's it going now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's thousands of</font>

154
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:02,039
devices sending really big packets to

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,650
their friends and neighbors so they

156
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,539
start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write more scripts more tools</font>

157
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:09,659
because one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing the underground is</font>

158
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,159
really good at doing is innovating so if

159
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,169
Dave here remember of team Kimber says

160
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,479
you know I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a thousand</font>

161
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:17,430
cisco routers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know how to</font>

162
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,969
script I don't know how to code not a

163
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,010
problem place your order Dave somebody

164
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,530
will write the tool to make it easy the

165
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,650
first ubiquitously use tool with Cisco's

166
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:33,150
dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> see this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little c program</font>

167
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:35,819
that went<font color="#E5E5E5"> out scam tcp 23 identified</font>

168
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:39,270
cisco routers and what did it do<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco</font>

169
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">cisco if it works save it off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

170
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,000
little file come back later for your

171
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:46,470
viewing enjoyment they were using what

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,810
people started to call the default

173
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,100
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't a default password it</font>

174
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:53,459
just turns out that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the easy</font>

175
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,630
one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use on a scale</font>

176
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,989
more massive than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ever thought</font>

177
00:08:54,630 --> 00:09:00,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">possible but then they figured few</font>

178
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,800
things out beyond this yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can send a</font>

179
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:07,380
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ICMP guess what else I can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

180
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,290
can use a cisco router as an IRC bounce

181
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:12,110
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are familiar with IRC</font>

182
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:16,349
and we would like it to go away forever

183
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:18,000
what a crowd what a crowd so they

184
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,220
figured out that if they bounced<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,620
a router they were no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from</font>

186
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,270
their home machine they're no longer

187
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,130
coming through your machine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

188
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:29,189
hacked which keeps going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

189
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,959
you keep patching it on me this is quite

190
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:35,280
a benefit they found<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they could</font>

191
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,109
send spam through these routers and so

192
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,130
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to see in the public side</font>

193
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:43,800
where things like I got spam from OC 48

194
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:48,630
dash blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah clearly that's not</font>

195
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,189
true right proxies all kinds of services

196
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:55,200
they just drove right through these

197
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:57,000
routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2827 a miscreant who is a bot</font>

hold life anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with cold</font>

200
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:03,240
life heard me talk about before it's a

201
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:06,030
variant of GT bot it's a window spot

202
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,320
it's all written in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mirc script and he</font>

203
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,990
decided he was gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all these bots</font>

204
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,390
and he did<font color="#CCCCCC"> get tens of thousands</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

205
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:17,490
he included on every one of them a list

206
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:19,620
of 2827<font color="#E5E5E5"> compromised routers through</font>

207
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,580
which the bots would access the command

208
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and control channel clever you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find the</font>

209
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:29,910
command<font color="#E5E5E5"> and control what did you really</font>

210
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:31,199
bust a list of routers you call up the

211
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:33,900
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who own those routers what do you</font>

212
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,070
suppose the response is is that the big

213
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:38,490
thing with blinky lights are the little

214
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing with Winky lights right so they</font>

215
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:42,330
were adding layers of obfuscation in

216
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,880
fact when that bot kicked off an attack

217
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,800
it could do two attacks one from the

218
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,170
bots proper the other from the cisco

219
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,520
routers you got this different type of

220
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:53,099
attack from all these different sources

221
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,500
next slide please so remember what I

222
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,360
said about scripting and making life

223
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,660
easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the miscreants so they put</font>

224
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,330
together nice GUI tools to help them

225
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:04,680
scan<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Lloyd Wright this is fairly</font>

226
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,839
two to one I like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they put the</font>

227
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,949
cisco logo on there it's a source of

228
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">pride and they would just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through and</font>

229
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">own these things and now what's</font>

230
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,620
interesting about this tool and tools

231
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,680
like it remember I said about cisco see

232
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:22,620
scanty cb23<font color="#E5E5E5"> or NASA cisco you are make a</font>

233
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,510
list this cool izle different you're not

234
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,280
a router you are router login to the

235
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:29,189
router change the password on the router

236
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,600
set some apples on the router how many

237
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of you have ever a 'cold yourself out of</font>

238
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:37,490
your own router look<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the people</font>

239
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">with their hands not up are lying</font>

240
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:44,379
so the miscreants went through the same

241
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:46,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">learning curve two miscreants jumped on</font>

242
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:48,609
to the same router one miscreant had

243
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,199
hacked it another miscreant was trying

244
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:52,839
to mess with him a little bit this

245
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:55,899
miscreant hadn't set the password but

246
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,339
now it starts to turn ugly it's an

247
00:11:55,899 --> 00:11:59,559
ownership thing a pride thing I'm

248
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:03,059
kicking you off this router but neither

249
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:07,959
one of us have written<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles before and</font>

250
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:09,789
they're off eventually one of them

251
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:12,849
wrightson tackle that blocks all tcp

252
00:12:09,789 --> 00:12:14,470
anywhere everywhere and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

253
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:16,449
they're both<font color="#E5E5E5"> off haha now what's funny</font>

254
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:19,329
is you're picturing this small office

255
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:22,748
click click click click click not

256
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:25,929
working so they scripted this now

257
00:12:22,749 --> 00:12:29,199
anybody can download the tool scan

258
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:32,139
entire ranges it took them with this

259
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:36,699
tool and a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> one about 32 hours to</font>

260
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:39,519
scan an entire / 8 think about that that

261
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:40,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">may seem like a lot of time to us but if</font>

262
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,939
all you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is hanging out in the</font>

263
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:45,850
bar all day it's nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know your</font>

264
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:47,709
machine is hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work they don't run</font>

265
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,489
this from just one machine next slide

266
00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:53,559
please so oh but Rob I'm sure they only

267
00:12:51,489 --> 00:12:54,850
own those little frame practi router as

268
00:12:53,559 --> 00:13:00,429
you know with default routes and things

269
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:02,799
sure lots<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and these this router</font>

270
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:06,399
was GSR obviously hopefully you can read

271
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:12,699
the text I've tried to expand it and had

272
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:14,229
30 plus ebgp peers and was owned so this

273
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:17,199
miscreant hops in the channel he says

274
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:21,429
hey I just owned a router my first one

275
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:22,599
so proud what do I do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those of</font>

276
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,549
other miscreants like a download this

277
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,229
tool go get this web page it'll tell you

278
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:28,449
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to script your ackles and stuff you</font>

279
00:13:26,229 --> 00:13:30,069
know to block access<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one of them</font>

280
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:34,449
says what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of router is it you know</font>

281
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:38,608
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really know GSR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and if one can</font>

282
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:38,608
envision drool in an IRC channel

283
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,369
so you had to there were several

284
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:44,569
miscrits but<font color="#CCCCCC"> two one saying you don't</font>

285
00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:45,350
want that router it's really stinky once

286
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:51,410
you give it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll take it off your</font>

287
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:52,790
hands the other one dude you rock so

288
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,290

00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,950
finding this thing called bgp and by the

382
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:13,659

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,270
do that showed him the commands

393
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:46,110
necessary to add a route into the global

394
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:51,070
table suppose he kept that to himself

395
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:54,550

431
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,250
money next slide please so final

432
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,530
thoughts this will<font color="#E5E5E5"> make Randy happy</font>

433
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,510
there's a strong motive to compromise

434
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,030
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers it's no longer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pride it's</font>

435
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:44,129
not status it is money there's a strong

436
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,040
motive to hijack your prefixes spam

437
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,510
video scanning activity all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if I</font>

438
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">can drive it off a prefix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that doesn't</font>

439
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,240
long to me I avoid the pain the simplest

440
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,639
of best practices do help there are

441
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,020
advanced ways to hurt a router that's

442
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,910
not what they're using why aren't they

443
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:02,400
using it because they're dumb no we

444
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:06,690
don't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it necessary they don't have</font>

445
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:08,340
to next slide please so thank you all of

446
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:10,590
you for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your time all of you who send me</font>

447
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:14,449
coffee I love you dearly thanks to Randy

448
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:14,449
my lovely assistant<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm rob</font>

449
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,540
I'm not as entertaining as Rob but for a

450
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,929
government guy you'll see I'm not too

451
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,340
bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so this presentation is about</font>

452
00:22:32,929 --> 00:22:36,770
approaches and techniques you can use

453
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:39,169
today these are things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

454
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:42,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">documented out there there in the the</font>

455
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:45,200
CIS benchmark they're reflected in team

456
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,880
Cymru's templates there an NSA router

457
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:51,380
guide there are all those places tom

458
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,030
aikens book etc as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not really</font>

459
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,280
a part of this community<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't know</font>

460
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:58,490
me I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working for NSA for 15</font>

461
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:02,540
years doing mostly network security

462
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,830
related technologies you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see on here</font>

463
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,350
on from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information assurance</font>

464
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:10,309
Directorate that's the defense side of

465
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:14,270
NSA I don't do spooky spy stuff I<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

466
00:23:10,309 --> 00:23:18,460
defend us networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way you</font>

467
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:22,760
guys help defend commercial networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

468
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,830
right so my goal in this talk is to

469
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:27,500
define a conceptual basis for router

470
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,300
security and then give you examples of

471
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,480
how some current techniques fit into

472
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,889
that conceptual basis and there's just

473
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">an outline there it's no big deal I</font>

474
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:38,900
often get the question from my<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers</font>

475
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,059
well I have these routers I want to

476
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,280
secure and I have all these books about

477
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:45,649
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it but which pieces are most</font>

478
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,970
important for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when I'm going to</font>

479
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">share with you is sort of the conceptual</font>

480
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:52,040
basis I try to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> them to help them</font>

481
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:55,010
decide what what they should what

482
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:58,460
techniques they should employ all right

483
00:23:55,010 --> 00:24:02,020
so why should you do this I mean rob has

484
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:04,610
given you a great cover to the threat

485
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:07,220
these hackers are out to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> control of</font>

486
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:09,919
your networks previously<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they could</font>

487
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,100
like trash talk each other but now so

488
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,400
that they can earn money from spammers

489
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,530
and others in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD we have additional</font>

490
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,230
people that we worry about hurting our

491
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:23,360
networks another good reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

492
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:24,620
reduce downtime you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> right your</font>

493
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,110
customers are counting on you to keep

494
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,790
those networks up to hide information

495
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,110
about your networks you know you know

496
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,830
it's your network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want someone</font>

497
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">else knowing how it runs how it's built</font>

498
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:37,070
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick your customers and your clients</font>

499
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,150
and your<font color="#CCCCCC"> partner's the people that you</font>

500
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">peer with they don't want to</font>

501
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:43,520
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting stuff through your link and</font>

502
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:46,220
lastly uh George said this bullet was

503
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,379
corny but to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> your country the</font>

504
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:50,870
u.s. considers and many other countries

505
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:54,950
consider the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a critical</font>

506
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:56,300
national infrastructure resource and it

507
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,370
but it can't be protected by the

508
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:03,440
government it can only be protected by

509
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:05,209
the people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> run it okay security for</font>

510
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">a router for any piece of a network</font>

511
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:10,010
infrastructure has to be driven by

512
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:11,750
threat if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know what it is</font>

513
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're trying to mitigate how are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

514
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,790
going to know how to secure it document

515
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:18,230
it in policy my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for this</font>

516
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:20,149
is if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have written down what</font>

517
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,540
your goals are how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you going to know</font>

518
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:26,420
when you can go home finished and if

519
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,340
you're at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marie case tutorial yesterday</font>

520
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:31,550
she emphasized this quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit also and</font>

521
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:33,379
then you take those mitigations that you

522
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:35,540
document in your policy implement them

523
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:38,060
in the router configurations and in your

524
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:41,180
network architecture then you maintain

525
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:42,800
it with consistent procedures some

526
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,680
colleagues of mine go out and actually

527
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,659
look at DoD networks and they often see

528
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">that something may have been set up well</font>

529
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:52,030
but then not maintained and we all know

530
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:55,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">how that goes things kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of drift and</font>

531
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:57,139
lastly you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to audit and test to</font>

532
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,240
make sure that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really did set it up</font>

533
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,470
the way you thought you did<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that the</font>

534
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,070
security is really working the way you

535
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:07,430
want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all right so this is the</font>

536
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:11,659
obligatory cheesy animation so you start

537
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:13,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">with some threats and you try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

538
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:17,600
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find best practices or define</font>

539
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:20,260
local policies and then you define

540
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,159
security controls based on that and

541
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,470
first thing you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is protect</font>

542
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,060
physical integrity then worry<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

543
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,710
protecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the static long-term</font>

544
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:32,179
configuration then the dynamic state and

545
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:34,220
finally use those well locked down

546
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:37,040
devices to protect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the</font>

547
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:39,470
network and this is a really the

548
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,530
important piece I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to share so let's</font>

549
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that just a smidge more</font>

550
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:47,930
physical integrity is very important

551
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:50,570
because if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has physical access</font>

552
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,360
to your device its security is not going

553
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,510
to stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> up very</font>

554
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">long you know we all know ways for doing</font>

555
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,210
password recovery and things like that

556
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> term there static</font>

557
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,240
configurations the<font color="#E5E5E5"> long term state the</font>

558
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,150
router holds all the time things like

559
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's config the addresses on the</font>

560
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:10,020
interfaces things of that nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

561
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:14,520
log server is who it's triple a server

562
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,900
is even if your router is physically

563
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,290
locked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the closet nobody can get to</font>

564
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,780
it if they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> change that information</font>

565
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:23,879
your router will be owned as Rob said

566
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:26,070
and that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what Rob was talking</font>

567
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:29,429
about was people attacking the static

568
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:32,040
configuration who's my pgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> pier you know</font>

569
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:36,240
what are the addresses what ackles do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

570
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,980
have right um next is a dynamic state

571
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,390
and that's getting closer to change the

572
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,280
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like routes the dynamic state is</font>

573
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:45,179
the the data of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your router that changes</font>

574
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:48,809

604
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:10,629
if your threat is<font color="#E5E5E5"> login by hackers or</font>

00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:21,669
morning things like rancid and tool can

609
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:24,309
help you keep administrators accountable

610
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:26,169
for their actions if your threat is that

<font color="#CCCCCC">you won't be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

612
00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:30,789
than what mechanisms should you use well

613
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,769
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good news is there are pretty good</font>

614
00:29:30,789 --> 00:29:34,299
mechanisms on today's devices at least

615
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:37,840
the ones I've had opportunity to use

616
00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:40,809
that can do this you can have local

617
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,990
username password settings for every

618
00:29:40,809 --> 00:29:45,610
individual user no shared accounts or of

619
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">course you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Center eyes Triple A</font>

620
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:49,629
which is a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better idea for scale so</font>

621
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,629
if you have more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a couple devices</font>

622
00:29:49,629 --> 00:29:55,019
you'd want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way address based</font>

623
00:29:52,629 --> 00:29:58,259
filters centralized cryptographic

authentication are all a good idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

625
00:29:58,259 --> 00:30:04,990
that will mitigate largely or maybe even

626
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:09,490
totally those threats and that's

627
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:11,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology you can use today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok another</font>

628
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:14,289
threat might be exposure of sensitive

firm a Shinto unauthorized listeners if

630
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:18,789
you're doing administration where your

631
00:30:17,379 --> 00:30:21,699
administrative session might go over

632
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:23,559
untrusted links for example I'm sure at

633
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,090
least someone in this room is logged

634
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:29,168
into a piece of infrastructure device

635
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,490
back at their office right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

636
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:33,399
I'll try it<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah anybody who's logged</font>

637
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:38,230
into a device back at their office raise

638
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:43,239
your hand Oh more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought oh so</font>

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this some this room</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably is</font>

643
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:58,509
so you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be using some mechanism</font>

644
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:01,029
that protects<font color="#CCCCCC"> that traffic keeps it</font>

confidential protects its integrity and

646
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:05,409
the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news there is that a lot of</font>

647
00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:08,289
devices have this already maybe not all

648
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:10,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">but most of them do they have ssh</font>

649
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:12,820
servers that many of them can support

650
00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:14,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kerber eyes telnet some of them can</font>

652
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:19,609
l personally I've seen that more on VPN

653
00:31:17,659 --> 00:31:22,029
gateways and firewalls than I have on

654
00:31:19,609 --> 00:31:25,460
routers but even some routers do it now

655
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:31,159
you could set up IPSec that's a popular

656
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:33,679
one in some places or if in a few few

657
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:35,929
places I've seen people set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> separate</font>

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">back-end networks for this pretty rare</font>

659
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:40,159
but it does get done<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that was</font>

660
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:42,320
the static config now let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

661
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,359
the dynamic state your threat might be

662
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,559
exposure of your network architecture

663
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:50,299
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> people aren't allowed to</font>

664
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:51,950
know it so you might require that only

665
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,109
internal monitoring stations are

666
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:56,869
authorized collect information from your

667
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:59,570
boxes that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty straightforward</font>

668
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:03,049
and there are mechanisms address based

669
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:06,379
filters a strong encryption on the

670
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:09,139
management protocols and ipsec that you

671
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:11,029
can use now that one's not quite as easy

672
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:13,639
as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might sound for example your</font>

673
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:15,979
router might support snmpv3 but if your

674
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:17,478
management tools don't support it the

675
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:19,489
fact that the router supports it really

676
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:21,379
doesn't help you so this is starting

677
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:24,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost to edge into George's territory</font>

678
00:32:21,379 --> 00:32:27,289
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to back off okay next one</font>

679
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:28,580

680
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:33,559
quite a bit yesterday if you were at her

681
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:36,428
tutorial the threat is somebody giving

682
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:38,418
you bogus routing information right and

683
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:40,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">randy mentioned this in one of his</font>

685
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:45,379
being important that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

686
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:47,089
a threat so you want to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept</font>

687
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:49,070
routing updates maybe you say ok I'm

688
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:51,499
going to mitigate this threat to my

689
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:54,499
dynamic state by accepting<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing</font>

692
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:01,908
a little difficult there are some

693
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:04,070
mechanisms out there for this but they

694
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:06,469
have they have glitches you can use

695
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:10,718
filters you can use shared secret

696
00:33:06,469 --> 00:33:14,479
authentication how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

697
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:16,299
running say<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP that's popular right</font>

698
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:19,399
you're all running that well that has

699
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:23,239
md5 based authentication so does ospf so

700
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:25,728
does is is so does<font color="#E5E5E5"> eigrp and so does rip</font>

701
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:28,160
version 2 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with that list that</font>

702
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:30,770
covers most most routing protocols

703
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,840
and another one that's sort of starting

704
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get some adoption I put it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gray is</font>

actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yet anyway out here</font>

709
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:46,970
no that's been talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

710
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:49,040
protecting network traffic so once you

711
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">have your your network infrastructure</font>

712
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,600
devices and that sort of infrastructure

they represent<font color="#E5E5E5"> lockdown you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

714
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,659
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect your network traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um maybe</font>

715
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,400
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the threat of spoof 2d das</font>

716
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,760
traffic exiting your network that's kind

717
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,380
of a no-brainer so what do you how do

718
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:09,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you handle that you can use interface</font>

719
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:11,710
filters you can use unicast RPF you can

720
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:13,970
use a null routing of various kinds

721
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:16,040
maintaining that can be difficult so

722
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:20,739
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are services exist in fact team</font>

723
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:23,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">sumeru runs a service it's called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bogan</font>

724
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:25,759
vogue on route service and you can

725
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect to these services and they'll</font>

726
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,870
help you null route that inappropriate

727
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:33,918
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay a little little trickier</font>

728
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:35,350
requirement if you have it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

729
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,629
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a threat to your network is</font>

730
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:41,000
flooding attacks that use ICMP you might

731
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:43,040
set a requirement well ICMP can can

732
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,780
consume no more than five percent of the

733
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,330
link bandwidth just a number i picked

734
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,700
out of the air well most modern routers

735
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:51,739
have mechanisms that can do that they're

736
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:53,750
not usually very simple but they're

737
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:57,129
documented and they're out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and you</font>

738
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:59,210
can take advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them to impose a</font>

739
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,130
mitigation and then you got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it</font>

740
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:06,740
test it see how well<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

741
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:09,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain it over time so I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

742
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,410
finish up now there are a lot of

743
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,820
resources out there my personal feeling

744
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,080
of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking around is that there's</font>

745
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,500
probably more resources out there for

746
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,640
cisco right now than some of the other

747
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,620
companies but the resources<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there</font>

748
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:26,240
for all all the router manufacturers

749
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,730
cisco isp essentials is a good one

750
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,330
hardening cisco routers is a book<font color="#CCCCCC"> i very</font>

751
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:34,730
much enjoyed there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other to</font>

752
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:39,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is benchmark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA guide there's</font>

753
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:39,220
all the resources at team Cymru's site

754
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:44,650
juniper as documentation

755
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:48,230
ciso of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juniper benchmark sometimes soon</font>

756
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:49,990
foundry has a security guide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

757
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:54,320
same is true most your other vendors so

758
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:56,290
use those resources right take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

759
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,390
concepts of what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to protect</font>

760
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:00,980
have those written down then you can

761
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,620
much more easily go to the vendor

762
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:05,480
documentation or other resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say</font>

763
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,630
okay now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I want to protect</font>

764
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:11,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I can find the mechanisms hopefully</font>

765
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:14,170
they'll let me do it ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

766
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:14,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand over to George</font>

767
00:36:49,819 --> 00:36:56,930
we're back pretty good well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

768
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:58,160
both first of all right right will do so

769
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:00,049
first of all let's thank brandy for

770
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,308
inviting me to to give this talk and

771
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:08,049
thank you all for coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes we're going</font>

772
00:37:04,309 --> 00:37:08,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">to change the let's go with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

773
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:32,549
was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way no no it's fine it's</font>

774
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:34,950
fine I'm fine so anyway my name is ben

775
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:37,109
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> George Jones i'm currently working</font>

776
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:38,519
from mitre corporation until earlier

777
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:40,890
this year I spent about three years

778
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:43,348
working at<font color="#CCCCCC"> unit and there my sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

779
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:45,150
main thing was infrastructure security

780
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:46,920
of the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosting data centers so at</font>

781
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:49,200
that point I was dealing with something

782
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,460
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data centers about 450</font>

783
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,019
routers and switches and that sort of

784
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,220
thing and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's how I got</font>

785
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:55,500
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be thinking about these sorts of</font>

786
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:58,680
things one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in those</font>

787
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,569
in that role was when vendor<font color="#CCCCCC"> X would</font>

788
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,009
bring in a new new box they would go

789
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:03,359
over to the engineering people and they

790
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:05,279
would see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know can it do throughput</font>

791
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:07,049
you know does bgp work then it would

792
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:08,339
come over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the security side and we</font>

793
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:10,079
would say you know here's the list of

794
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:12,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that we want to be able to do you</font>

795
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,829
know if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take this box and</font>

796
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:15,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">put it on our network and operate it and</font>

797
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:16,799
what we consider to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a secure fashion</font>

798
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:19,019
you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the list that we're</font>

799
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:20,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use and so</font>

800
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:22,558
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really where this work came from</font>

801
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:23,910
and the our idea was it would be good

802
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,279
idea just to get some public feedback

803
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:29,578
and see if other people had the same had

804
00:38:26,279 --> 00:38:30,750
the same goals the draft is up there you

805
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:33,839
can go you can go take a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

806
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">and review that and let's see right and</font>

807
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,430
so what we're talking about not the the

808
00:38:35,549 --> 00:38:39,750
title what we're talking about is

809
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,940
basically you know the settings what's

810
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:43,170
what what what controls do you need you

811
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,000
know do you need logging do you need

812
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,079
authentication you know what do you need

813
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

814
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,130
and run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> securely the now and then</font>

815
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:51,990
portion and we'll talk about this and a

816
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:53,519
little bit later but the now is

817
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:55,439
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

818
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,000
tried to sell you a box today you know

819
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,470
that didn't have oh I don't know logging

820
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,930
or something you would tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to go</font>

821
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:03,209
home the then is the things that you

822
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,828
know you wish you wish people would do

823
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:06,210
you wish the vendors reduce maybe some

824
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:07,740
of them are doing it maybe none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

825
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:11,819
are doing it so that's sort of sort of

826
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:14,279
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> breakdown what we've got and this is</font>

827
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:16,829
why I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay alright so</font>

828
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:18,420
the touch just for one slide here I'm

829
00:39:16,829 --> 00:39:21,509
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sort of what the stuff that Rob</font>

830
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,730
was going on you know could the question

831
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:26,069
of what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really about is you know</font>

832
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,980
will you no will I continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to own my</font>

833
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:31,440
router right I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show of hands</font>

834
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,089
here how many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

835
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,980
been in the middle of tracking an attack

836
00:39:33,089 --> 00:39:36,240
or something and you've written an

837
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,590
access control list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just</font>

838
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font>

839
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:39,380
you know ready to hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> return button</font>

840
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,839
and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden the fear grips</font>

841
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,520
you you know is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to drive the</font>

842
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,840
route processor you know through the

843
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">roof and am I going to lose my router</font>

844
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,350
when I hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> the return to apply this this</font>

845
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:53,480
access list how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have been in</font>

846
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:54,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">that situation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay very good how many</font>

847
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ever worried or how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

848
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,100
people will do the inverse on this one

849
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:00,529
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have not worried about</font>

850
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,880
things about the script kiddies taking

851
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:03,980
your router down about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> latest you</font>

852

<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pat single packet jams the input</font>

856
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:16,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so I think it's fair to say</font>

857
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,900
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know script kiddies not taking</font>

858
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,900
down your router is sort of something

859
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'd like to be a requirement and then</font>

860
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,300
this this one's rhetorical how many

861
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that you know in 2003</font>

862
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,320
that using using<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols for</font>

863
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,480
management of you know critical

864
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,700
infrastructure devices which use either

865
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,480
plaintext passwords or in a case of say

866
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,890
tftp you know no passwords it is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

867
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,410
a bad idea and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we ought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

868
00:40:39,890 --> 00:40:48,410
beyond that that's that's more or less

869
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:49,670
rhetorical<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so to solve this</font>

870
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:51,859
problem there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really sort of two</font>

871
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:53,600
things you can do one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

872
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,670
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to muddle through and do things</font>

873
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,500
and fight fires and you know just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font>

874
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,780
of make do with whatever the vendors you

875
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,250
know throw over the wall at you and the

876
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:02,600
other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do is ask the</font>

877
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,640
vendors for better features and that's

878
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of what this talk is about it is</font>

879
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">about you know hopefully the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nsp the ISP</font>

880
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,330
communities coming together and and you

881
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:13,190
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and saying this is what we want you</font>

00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:14,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">know to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> credit of cisco and juniper</font>

883
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,340

884
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:18,859
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> are spending a lot of cycles on</font>

885
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:20,030
this you know hiring people like Rob you

886
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there and they're doing a very</font>

887
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:24,080
good job and I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I commend them</font>

888
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:26,270
for what they're doing but you know I

889
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:28,580
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a place for the operator</font>

890
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:29,600
community to come together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say look</font>

891
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,950
you know here's a here's our

892
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,990
requirements and then we get together

893
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:35,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">and talk so that's that's that's mostly</font>

894
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:37,220
what this is about and just to reiterate

895
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:39,140
the goal what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about here</font>

896
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not sort of firewalls we're not</font>

897
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:42,770
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about intrusion detection</font>

898
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,180
anti-spam you know we're not talking

899
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">about stuff on the desktop we're talking</font>

900
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,569
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to keep your networks running</font>

901
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,359
how to keep them passing customer

902
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,920
traffic

903
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:51,690
you know how to keep them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

904
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,519
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> from violating your a UPS that</font>

905
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:58,529
sort of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so next thing</font>

906
00:41:56,519 --> 00:41:59,939
I'm going to do is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in one slide i'm</font>

907
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:01,920
going to give you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an overview of</font>

908
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">the draft and just to give you an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

909
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,549
of what's in it then following this you

910
00:42:04,289 --> 00:42:07,710
know time permitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've got four</font>

911
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:09,509
examples of stuff in the now category

912
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:11,009
and four examples of stuff in the then

913
00:42:09,509 --> 00:42:12,660
category and so what we'll just we'll

914
00:42:11,009 --> 00:42:14,099
just go through some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these but this</font>

915
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,420
is just to give you an idea of what's in

916
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,950
here and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm really after in this</font>

917
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,480
whole talk is for people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

918
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,460
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this and and you know</font>

919
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,349
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> in feedback because you know I</font>

920
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:25,460
can't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this alone it's sort of sort of</font>

921
00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:28,529
you guys have to give give the input

922
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:30,720
alright so the 01 draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> what say we've</font>

923
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:32,220
got functional requirements which is the

924
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,470
lion's share of them we've got

925
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,868
documentation and assurance requirements

926
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,980
and then the last thing profiles so I'll

927
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:39,660
just take a quick spin through

928
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,690
functional to give you an idea what's in

929
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:43,710
them so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance device management</font>

930
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:44,910
device management you would like you

931
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:46,109
know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Neil sort of alluded to you'd</font>

932
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,629
like to be able to say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know I</font>

933
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:50,279
can I can you know securely manage my

934
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,380
device and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at that in</font>

935
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:54,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit you would like to possibly</font>

936
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,819
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to manage it in band because in</font>

937
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:58,769
most situations a lot of situations you

938
00:42:56,819 --> 00:43:00,420
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you have is the same is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

939
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:01,828
same connection that the customer data

940
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,720
goes over so you'd like to be able to

941
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,970
manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way out of band you know if</font>

942
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,649
you happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an overlay IP network</font>

943
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:08,939
or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to have you know modem</font>

944
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:11,339
hung off the side of the thing you'd

945
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:13,349
like to be able to manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way user</font>

946
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:16,650
interface you know is it acceptable to

947
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:19,230
have a high bandwidth graphical you know

948
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:21,359
windows based interface to manage into a

949
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,039
box in in a situation where you can't

950
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,239
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it through the front end on all</font>

951
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,549
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> modem you know can you</font>

952
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:29,099
really do the screen updates you know

953
00:43:26,549 --> 00:43:31,259
over over a modem so that's sort of user

954
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:32,880
interface sorts of things or do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

955
00:43:31,259 --> 00:43:35,759
really want a command-line interface I

956
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,430
mean that's that's one question IP stack

957
00:43:35,759 --> 00:43:40,589
do you want to be able to do things like

958
00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:42,660
turn off directed broadcasts or IP

959
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:44,880
options you know think things in that

960
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:46,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">class you know is it acceptable to have</font>

00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:58,440
to it's often<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful tool for</font>

966
00:43:56,489 --> 00:43:59,730
four you know it for making sure that

967
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,750
your router's not doing really insane

968
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:03,750
things

969
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:05,430
and then we the next three are basically

970
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:07,440
air filtering capabilities these are

971
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,790
sort of a large part of the draft you

972
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,770
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a minimum you would like to be</font>

00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:13,680
able to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know only same is</font>

974
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:17,850
na pista management stations can talk to

documentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements this is</font>

997
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:08,490
things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what what protocols</font>

998
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,470
does this box implement what ports is it

999
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,330
listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but 22 by default you know</font>

1000
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:16,080
what is on this box what is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

1001
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:17,910
exposure assurance this is this is

1002
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:20,009
things like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

1003
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:21,810
this one in detail but you know what

1004
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,970
assurance do I have that the box is not

1005
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:25,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to fall down right you know it's</font>

1006
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:26,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">not a functional requirement but how do</font>

1007
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">I know that you know maybe the vendor is</font>

1008
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,150
going to be responsive and give me

1009
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,240
patches and updates when I need them how

1010
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:35,550
do I know that and then lastly profiles

1011
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:36,959
we make the admission that not all

1012
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,310
devices are created equal you know

1013
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,660
you've got core devices you've got edge

1014
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,880
devices you've got layer two devices

1015
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:43,589
you've got layer 3 devices and so

1016
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,630
profiles are just a mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1017
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:47,580
grouping sets of requirements that apply

1018
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:50,100
to different classes of devices so that

1019
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,350
in one slide is is the overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1020
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:54,000
draft it's just sort of a skeleton and a

1021
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:59,040
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a way to plug in you know plug-in</font>

1022
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,350
requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's see right so</font>

1023
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,750
examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we'll go into some examples</font>

1024
00:46:01,350 --> 00:46:05,400
and just take a look at this so the

1025
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:06,780
first one is secure management channels

1026
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,090
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again I've sort of already</font>

1027
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,980
talked about this you would like to be

1028
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,450
able to manage end and you know in a lot

1029
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,250
of cases today that's that's going to be

1030
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,750
SSH or TLS or IP

1031
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:18,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">SEC or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

1032
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,520
know that nobody's nobody's seeing your

1033
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,200
management traffic that nobody is

1034
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:24,480
injecting interesting little commands

1035
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,029
into your command stream you know and

1036
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might want it for instance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll</font>

1037
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:30,330
hide the identity of your management

1038
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,310
stations there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just all kinds of thing</font>

1039
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:37,460
you would like secure and and management

1040
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:39,720
be that in band or out of band<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1041
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,370
right i mentioned this one already the

1042
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,490
ability to identify all listening

1043
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:46,140
services you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want you want</font>

1044
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:47,779
to know what's there you what you want

1045
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:51,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know what your what your exposure is</font>

1046
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:54,210
and right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> so what did what this comes</font>

1047
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,370
down to is you know to take take the

1048
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:58,020
analogy of a house right you know you if

1049
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:59,190
you're a house with no windows right

1050
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,509
nobody's going to come climbing in

1051
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,040
through the windows if you have a

1052
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:06,690
network with no windows nobody's going

1053
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:09,330
to have no nevermind viruses okay so but

1054
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,220
the point is reduce your exposure so

1055
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:15,690
this is identifying all listening

1056
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:17,279
services the corollary is the ability to

1057
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,360
disable all listening services so you

1058
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,620
want to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to go you know if you're</font>

1059
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use telnet for management</font>

1060
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:22,799
you would like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font>

1061
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,420
turn it off you know what I'm what I'm

1062
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,860
saying and this is it's a requirement

1063
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,060
that you know you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what everything</font>

1064
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:34,500
is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it off</font>

1065
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:36,600
excuse me right right yeah if you want

1066
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:38,250
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send in for instance requirements do</font>

1067
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:40,319
it you know send them to send them to me

1068
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,000
send them to the list you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1069
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,320
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just a sample here to</font>

1070
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,770
show you what sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1071
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:51,890
draft okay we're doing good we're doing

1072
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,890
good

1073
00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:58,779
all right right so I've already

1074
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,730
mentioned this you would like to be able

1075
00:47:58,779 --> 00:48:02,710
to filter traffic directed to the device

1076
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,599
and again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just so you know you</font>

1077
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:06,640
know what's what you know who's managing

1078
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:08,230
your device know that it's hopefully you

1079
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,788
that's managing your<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices I think</font>

1080
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">where I've already sort of talked about</font>

1081
00:48:09,789 --> 00:48:16,779
miscreants making sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> only they</font>

1082
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:18,460
could manage the device right so that

1083
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:20,019
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anne's the examples of the now</font>

1084
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,760
you know those<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of things you know</font>

1085
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:22,930
you you would hopefully beat on people

1086
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,510
if they tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sell you a box that</font>

1087
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:27,940
didn't do them in going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1088
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:30,269
process it's been sort of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of i'm</font>

1089
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:34,240
using to me which which items drew flak

1090
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:35,799
and so some of these i originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> had in</font>

1091
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the now portion and they've moved to</font>

1092
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:42,160
the then portion the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to filter</font>

1093
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:44,169
at line rate you know if if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1094
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply access control lists you know to</font>

1095
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> box that only that allow only</font>

1096
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:50,710
authorized traffic to it but somebody

1097
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:52,990
can flood you and take the box off off

1098
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,510
off the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really useful</font>

1099
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:58,299
and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this this is sort of</font>

1100
00:48:55,510 --> 00:49:00,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously an idealized state but you</font>

1101
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:02,230
know you would like to be able to filter

1102
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:04,599
if you can apply filters you'd like to

1103
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,829
be able ideally to apply them and filter

1104
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:08,769
at line rate on all interfaces

1105
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:10,240
simultaneously and you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1106
00:49:08,769 --> 00:49:12,758
may be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tall requirement this is</font>

1107
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,609
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to imply you know ASIC</font>

1108
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:18,069
hardware implementations but you know I

1109
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:19,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's a very reasonable thing from</font>

1110
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:23,650
an operator's you know requirement point

1111
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:25,569
of view to ask for all right this one

1112
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:29,049
actually is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that surprised me</font>

1113
00:49:25,569 --> 00:49:31,569
the most that I got feedback on the the

1114
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:33,309
the basic idea here is that you know

1115
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:35,859
hacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> X should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not be able to go to</font>

1116
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:37,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">nessa's org download Nessus you know</font>

1117
00:49:35,859 --> 00:49:39,609
with all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fun router plugins or</font>

1118
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:41,500
whatever aim it at your box and get

1119
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:43,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">results right you know you shouldn't be</font>

1120
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,220
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at certain</font>

1121
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">advisories and try one that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

1122
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,419
years old and and and oh you know try

1123
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:50,680
the exploit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability</font>

1124
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's three years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and be able to take</font>

1125
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,038
the router down you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1126
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:58,329
this is just you know simple sorts of

1127
00:49:54,039 --> 00:50:00,039
things you know but I've gotten this is

1128
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:02,049
1 i've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotten a bit of pushback from</font>

1129
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:04,319
from the vendor community and I've come

1130
00:50:02,049 --> 00:50:06,549
to understand why

1131
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:08,079
let me just just let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> just run through</font>

1132
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:09,730
this the requirement is worded very

1133
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,049
carefully and the problem really is in

1134
00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:13,119
getting a definition that everybody can

1135
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,319
agree on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just sort of read it</font>

1136
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,270
here and then go through it so the

1137
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:18,339
vendor should provide software updates

1138
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:20,380
or configuration advice in a timely

1139
00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:22,480
fashion there there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one problem to</font>

1140
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:24,059
mitigate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the effects of quote well known</font>

1141
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,079
vulnerabilities unquote and

1142
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:28,299
vulnerabilities and well-known quote

1143
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:30,400
should be quote exploits on put so the

1144
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:32,020
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> really here is all in defining</font>

1145
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,420
these terms that agreeing on what these

1146
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:36,160
terms mean so you know what is in a

1147
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:38,230
timely fashion if I'm Anna if I'm a

1148
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,609
network operator and somebody takes my

1149
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,260
network down the advice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1150
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:43,029
configuration stuff was not provided in

1151
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,520
a timely fashion right i<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it i want</font>

1152
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:47,980
it before it takes my network down if

1153
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm a vendor on the other hand you know</font>

1154
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've got development cycles I've got</font>

1156
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:57,250
got revenue streams and that's that sort

1157
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:59,260
of thing so you know they're competing

1158
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:01,809
they're competing you know priorities as

1159
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:03,490
far as what is timely you know

1160
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:05,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known again if I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking an</font>

absolutist operators point of view well

00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:10,779
known mean means it got used against me

1163
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:12,579
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think sort of the low bar</font>

1164
00:51:10,779 --> 00:51:14,619
here might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for instance cert</font>

1165
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:16,150
advisories because of those tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

1166
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:18,130
out you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of infrequently and be</font>

00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:19,720
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the really wide impact things you</font>

1168
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,980
know you could move out to to my buddies

1169
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,200
that might<font color="#CCCCCC"> are over the seating of the</font>

1170
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:24,700
due to do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE stuff and say that you</font>

1171
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,558
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that are in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CVE database</font>

1172
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:28,419
you know would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the next round realm</font>

1173
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,980
out you could say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know Nessus</font>

1174
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:31,750
plugins whatever if somebody can take an

1175
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:34,829
essence<font color="#E5E5E5"> plug-in and you know but the</font>

1176
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:37,270
question really is what's well known and

1177
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:39,849
right so that's pretty much that but you

1178
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:41,380
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just you know from a gut level I</font>

1179
00:51:39,849 --> 00:51:43,420
don't think it's too<font color="#CCCCCC"> much to ask that</font>

1180
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,710
people not be able to you know knock

1181
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:49,990
down the boxes that i paid a lot of

1182
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:52,779
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> for okay i'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1183
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:56,140
here's here's one that's somewhat of a

1184
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:57,880
conundrum in we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

1185
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,589
select reliable delivery for log

1186
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:02,049
messages in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case there's already an</font>

1187
00:51:59,589 --> 00:52:03,490
RFC out there that defines exactly what

1188
00:52:02,049 --> 00:52:06,549
we want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we want to be able to</font>

1189
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:08,319
send messages reliably and RFC 3195 does

1190
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:10,569
a very good job of specifying that the

1191
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,089
problem here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the implementations</font>

1192
00:52:10,569 --> 00:52:15,549
you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> both in the the router</font>

1193
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:17,160
outer side and then on the the log

1194
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:19,650
server side just aren't there

1195
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,240
so it's not one that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say is best</font>

1196
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:23,609
current practice but the standards are

1197
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:26,308
there so that's sort of a conundrum so

1198
00:52:23,609 --> 00:52:29,220
that's why I moved over the ability to

1199
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,720
log all security related events you know

1200
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:33,629
so for instance when somebody logs into

1201
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:35,490
a router or logs in logs out when

1202
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,349
somebody violates an access control list

1203
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:38,700
when somebody makes a configuration

1204
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:41,880
change these are all things that you

1205
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:44,339
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about problem here is as</font>

1206
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:48,030
far as I know there is no well defined

1207
00:52:44,339 --> 00:52:49,529
set of things that you know that that

1208
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:51,420
say you know these these sorts of things

1209
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:53,250
should be logs this is an area where you

1210
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">know it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we might</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get</font>

1211
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:56,640
a working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group or something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going just</font>

1212
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:59,569
to define you know minimum set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1213
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,740
that ought to be logged security-wise

1214
00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:06,930
support scripting<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all management</font>

1215
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:08,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">functions so okay okay operator question</font>

1216
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:10,740
again how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four operators</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

1217
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:12,750
of you believe that the meant that the

1218
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:17,339
vendor is going to provide functions to

1219
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:18,839
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay how many how</font>

1220
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:20,190
many been ok vendor show of hands how

1221
00:53:18,839 --> 00:53:22,319
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can foresee all</font>

1222
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:24,270
the problems involved in managing large

1223
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:27,660
network or quick or responding quickly

1224
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:29,190
to two problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok no show of hands our</font>

1225
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,288
experience that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you net when i</font>

1226
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:33,420
was there was that you know we have

1227
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:35,400
large networks and and we just have to

1228
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,140
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to roll custom scripts to take</font>

1229
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:38,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the problems in our own network</font>

1230
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,410
and that's really all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement</font>

1231
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,710
is saying it is you know give us that

1232
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:47,129
give us that capability and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll wrap up</font>

1233
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:52,319
here right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to skip all the</font>

1234

details go read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft right and</font>

1235
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:58,859
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> go back i love x PDF as a</font>

take five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and write two lists</font>

1254
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:39,030
for me one is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security features</font>

00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I use now right what do you use in</font>

1256
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:41,910
your network every day that you would

1257

consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> a security feature send it to</font>

1258
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:45,930
me send it to the list the address will

1259
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,030
come up short like the other is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1260
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:49,560
things that either one vendor does that

00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:51,780
I really like and I wish were everywhere

1262
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,520
or it could just be pie in the sky sorts

1263
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:55,170
of sorts of things you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what sort of</font>

very useful and trying to explain these

1311
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:20,690
things to people why things are needed

1312

information sources outside things on

1320

the issue and become concerned about it

1327
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,920
and also see a light at the end of the

1328
