00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">title scaling network management tools I</font>

3
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:17,100
realized that representing a network of

00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:23,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">200 nodes is probably in this context in</font>

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:30,210
this meeting a bit ambitious title

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:33,770
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a some tools developed</font>

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:36,630
which we have done for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ourselves and</font>

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:40,739
what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing now is a picture of</font>

9
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,160
network covering the Norway this is a

10
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:50,218
loud map not very uncommon this one was

11
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:53,038
made in 97 it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you see is a</font>

12
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:57,510
geographic<font color="#CCCCCC"> auto-scaling network map</font>

13
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:04,140
system unit is the academic network

14
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:09,298
operator or Norway and some of the links

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:12,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">here are you knows about 2.5 gay so it's</font>

16
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,880
it's a small fairly normal network

17
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,350
operator so I just give you this

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,548
information so that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can understand</font>

19
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:26,070
in what context<font color="#CCCCCC"> we develop or tubes so</font>

20
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:30,390
why do we make our own tools we started

21
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">out clearly after the SMP came with the</font>

22
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,320
nice net tools that were quite early on

23
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,619
the market even I spectra were a bit

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,990
static and cumbersome to use and then

25
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:41,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">convert all our needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we started</font>

26
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,460
looking at the commercial platforms that

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were expected to develop tools that</font>

28
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:50,970
would be usable class but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seemed to</font>

29
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:52,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">be solving their own problems we we met</font>

30
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,908
them year by year and told him<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we</font>

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,250
wanted but<font color="#E5E5E5"> they never came back with</font>

32
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,920
anything useful you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

33
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,079
centralized operations they were

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,100
internet oriented they had Pru history

35
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,320
functions they were huge so not very

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful and then he looked at our own</font>

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,590
resources we had hackers he had to

38
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:19,770
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> not open software so we decided</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

39
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:22,860
make around Taylor tools and in this

40
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,020
process I have<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used that they have</font>

41
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,880
used some principles to develop this

42
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,860
software that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't did not find</font>

43
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:36,410
it in those commercial tools we looked

44
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:40,680
at and one of them are the let's say

45
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:43,950
properties that these systems should

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,200
have is accessibility we have a very

47
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,640
distributed organization covering

48
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,739
multiple places multiple organizations

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,790
we have we want to communicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:59,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">users the customers operations</font>

51
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:05,760
engineering services even the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

52
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:11,880
directors are interested to see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

53
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:15,320
the network perform the tools need to

54
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:19,140
provide trends so that we can see a

55
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,670
man'll dose will say users need need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

56
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:29,100
see what's happening on a long-term

57
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:33,299
scale to do planning to do whatever you

58
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to support hundreds of customers</font>

59
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:44,670
devices and things easily it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

60
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,570
need the summaries we need the threshold

61
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:54,720
monitoring we use tables we sort we get

62
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:57,810
the bad values on top this is fairly

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,180
simple but in fact this was not

64
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:04,769
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us as far as we have been</font>

65
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:08,549
seeing when you started doing this the

66
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,560
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> has to be dynamic you know the S&P</font>

67
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:14,190
index changed all the time it could not

68
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,108
track our data on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term basis it</font>

69
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,108
must be usable

70
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,180
the access has to be quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy the big</font>

71
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,430
platforms you know locked up<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything</font>

72
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:31,259
in a windows machine in the basement

73
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:35,310
with operators well we decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

74
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:37,110
visual quite early and graphs maps and

00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:03,389
network maps Nia geographical maps we

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:08,190
have schematic hand drawn maps which

83
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:12,320
with automatic fail in load we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:18,900
a comprehensive campus management system

with you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> steptronic that is scaling</font>

91
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:44,430
quite well it's auto detects it keeps

92
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:46,320
tracks of mac addresses and makes

93

all universe is now and it's increasing

95
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:55,919
popular so it's all made by by some it's

96
00:05:53,009 --> 00:06:00,270
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple the principles that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

from a topology database so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

101
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,830
have to care about how their maps look

<font color="#E5E5E5">line breaks down topology don't you</font>

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,508
suitable maps and

104
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:27,029
it's based on you Jim Cornette so here

105
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:29,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">is an example of you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can zoom in in our</font>

109
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:45,090
an example I guess we skip the part with

110
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:50,188
measurements you all know why we do

111
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:53,008
measurements we try to integrate with

00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:09,150
us find interesting problems in the

117
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:14,849
network we also we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can work at European</font>

118
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:21,469
level and project to to develop tools to

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:21,469
to further or network management control

120
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:31,439
we work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> passive passive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monitoring</font>

121
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:38,879
and on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pressing measurement platform</font>

122
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:40,529
and at 10 game we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a few SNP</font>

123
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,909
tools that we started developing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

124
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:47,250
90s a comprehensive link management

125
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:50,879
system to test all the scaling

126
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:54,449
properties the tables graphs aggregation

127
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,099
and error analysis it's also scaling

128
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:58,520
because if you just point to router and

129
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:02,520
it will collect all the statistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

130
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,960
the scaly mechanism here is that the IP

131
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,750
artists and the link name are mapped

132
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:10,560
together from a description field in the

133
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,779
interrupter someone earlier today or I

134
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,310
guess it was yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked if how do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you make operators you know do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,430
things they in fact are able to do they

link and this description field

141
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:36,140
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pick up this information</font>

142
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,510
from the router together with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the SNMP</font>

00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:23,739
statistical handling of data so that you

yeah some basic properties<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're like</font>

209
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:52,450

210
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:54,460
plots and tables that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned you</font>

have the percentiles you have the media

00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,770
in the max and you have the packet loss

213
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,199
so in all table you can sort it on what

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,290
you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can in that why</font>

00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:36,580
have a graphical distribution plot this

share the flow of information with our

sensitive here's an example of a graph

from this system pretty much like the

<font color="#E5E5E5">also are still not finna having finished</font>

295
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:06,120
thank you and we will learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say jab</font>

299
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:28,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">a small demo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought i would like to</font>

300
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">show to you a map showing system this</font>

301
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:35,760
system can zoom to let's say na interval

302
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:39,470
on the squares you see popping up when i

303
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:42,240
work around it is possible zooming areas

304
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,010
I we have loaded the database with

305
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,440
statistics for last five years so that

306
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:50,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can see how the how the loan has</font>

307
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,950
developed and we have a put a cpu load

308
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:56,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">for hours which will be shown in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

309
00:18:52,950 --> 00:19:00,510
points may I point the point size tells

310
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:04,650
you the size of the delay so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:08,250
satellite link just bits<font color="#CCCCCC"> Burton and I</font>

312
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:11,820
thought I just and the colors shows the

313
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:19,190
load where's the thickness of line shows

314
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:19,189
the capacity and the size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yeah so</font>

315
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,260
slope by network

316
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:30,980
yep

317
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,510
so we can see the dates here you know

318
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">watching</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic in Union it in</font>

319
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,070
September this also comes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

320
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:41,389
minutes their solutions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

321
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:44,000
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening today or yesterday this</font>

322
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:45,110
is i<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess most for fan but at least one</font>

323
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the professors at your nurse they</font>

324
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:56,479
told us he could use this for teaching

325
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:59,360
routing to the students so that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

326
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,670
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to show you now and so we</font>

327
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,050
have time for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of questions and</font>

328
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:05,990
looks like avi you've been extremely

329
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,010
patient over there just<font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting till</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

330
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,590
end that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you should do right</font>

331
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,790
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right one question</font>

332
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,439
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had since you're looking at doing</font>

333
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,830
passive monitoring to actually generate

334
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,230
flow data is have you been looking at

335
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,060
the performance aspects of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

336
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,370
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with that so doing tcp state</font>

337
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:24,679
reconstruction and looking at loss on a

338
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,330
per destination prefix basis to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

339
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,070
to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in to say these are the</font>

340
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,379
places on actually having performance

341
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:31,669
problems as opposed to waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

342
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:34,130
to call you and say hey I'm having

343
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:36,680
performance problems and then looking at

344
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,240
your routing based on that because I'm

345
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,190
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a cheap box that can do that</font>

346
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are plenty of $80,000 boxes that</font>

347
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:45,140
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but oh yeah we will name to</font>

348
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,810
the project was to have a cheap box

349
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:51,860
that's a fairly standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC that or high</font>

350
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:55,340
in DC we realize that can be able to

351
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,159
transport packet headers right at 10 gig

352
00:20:55,340 --> 00:21:00,770
and not you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a fill fast bus so</font>

353
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,480
we have concentrated on the basic issues

354
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,540
there that to get this packet header

355
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,630
stream up to the flow generation program

356
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:11,030
in an efficient manner using<font color="#CCCCCC"> membrana so</font>

357
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,470
I you and stuff like that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

358
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,810
the question is getting some very cheap

359
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:16,370
state analysis software to locate

360
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,720
retransmits and throughput and stuff

361
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:20,479
like that and then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a</font>

362
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,090
proprietary protocol export format which

363
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,380
you know is flow plus some performance

364
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:29,260
information on some of the flow

365
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:33,230
that would be interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah so</font>

366
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:37,760
we haven't sort of any complex flow

367
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:39,530
generation let's say problems yet we are

368
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,270
in the face of looking at the design of

369
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,770
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow generation okay so it looks</font>

370
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:49,720
like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a break and we start up</font>

371
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:49,720
again at<font color="#CCCCCC"> three fifteen thanks everyone</font>
