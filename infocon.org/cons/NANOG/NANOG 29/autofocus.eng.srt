1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:09,420
okay yeah so like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kay said the name of</font>

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tool is autofocus and it's answering</font>

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:21,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">a question that some of you care about</font>

4
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:24,060
hello okay that works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the</font>

5
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,039
question is who is using my link so this

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is not telling you anything about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,619
network view of the traffic matrix it's

8
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:33,360
only focusing on one link and it gives

9
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,430
you information about the traffic mix on

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,079
that link based on some detailed

11
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:41,190
measurement data such as net flow or

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:48,300
traces but it gets meaning out of that

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:50,129
vast amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of raw data so what's any</font>

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,809
formal definition of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem so</font>

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,140
current methods could give you things

16
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,930
such as fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the traffic is</font>

17
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:01,199
Gaza traffic and twenty percent of the

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,359
traffic comes from Steve's PC we want

19
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,220
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> more for example we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would want</font>

20
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,380
the analysis to tell us that twenty

21
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,990
percent of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic is Casa coming</font>

22
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,330
from Steve's pc and fifty percent is

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gaza from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain network prefix a</font>

24
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,759
that also includes<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve's pc so you can</font>

25
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,560
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is more detail about about</font>

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,189
the traffic makes more information and

27
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes it's useful so here's here's</font>

28
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,279
the system it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a traffic parser</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:34,259
goes over a sample<font color="#CCCCCC"> durant sample NetFlow</font>

30
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,540
data or packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the traces and fits</font>

31
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,150
this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> graphic that</font>

32
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">computes some plots and more importantly</font>

33
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,070
our traffic analyzer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> computes some</font>

34
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:47,189
textual traffic report and all these are

35
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:50,970
presented in a web based GUI and the

36
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:54,119
user can introduce most importantly some

37
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:56,130
categories that define various

38
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,520
meaningful categories of traffic that

39
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,589
are treated separately but<font color="#CCCCCC"> besides that</font>

40
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,460
it requires no user involvement so it's

41
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,759
an automatic tool a couple of details

42
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,090
it's downloadable it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> free for</font>

43
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,230
educational research and nonprofit use

44
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:17,040
but I repeat its download

45
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:19,290
double so it runs on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux and BSD and</font>

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,069
and possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> another other UNIX</font>

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,750
operating systems it it works best if

48
00:02:23,069 --> 00:02:26,190
you have a lot of memory and and a lot

49
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">of hard disk of course the amount of</font>

50
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,510
hard disk it requires depends on the

51
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,910
size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link you want to monitor you</font>

52
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:36,269
must have a browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> that knows</font>

53
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">JavaScript to use this system and it</font>

54
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:40,379
needs no web server so we can just read

55
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,349
this stuff of a local file so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now no</font>

56
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:45,450
server side scripting no security holes

57
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:49,260
exposed even though there might be bugs

58
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:53,040
in it so so what was the approach of

59
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,629
this this magic traffic analysis so we

60
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,480
need to describe all the important

61
00:02:54,629 --> 00:03:00,030
traffic clusters and and we want to

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">describe a multi field clusters so for</font>

63
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">example a flash crowd is not just</font>

64
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,090
defined by a destination IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

65
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:07,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">is also defined by protocol on the board</font>

66
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,440
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also want to talk about</font>

67
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,940
traffic at right granularity so if an

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,370
individual computers a lot of traffic

69
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,349
it's worth talking about it if it's just

70
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:17,819
a larger prefix a larger network that

71
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:18,988
has a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then then we should</font>

72
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:21,510
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network not about</font>

73
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,880
individual computers and of course the

74
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,599
analysis is automated so it gives you

75
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,609
insightful data without you having to

76
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,168
get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all into into this</font>

77
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,840
process<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just should see the final</font>

78
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:36,180
result so an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cleave this</font>

79
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">episode what I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by a traffic cluster</font>

80
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,190
well something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this the incoming</font>

81
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:43,290
web traffic for the cs department so the

82
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,209
source IP can be anything the

83
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,888
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination IP has to be in the prefix</font>

84
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,810
of that particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> department the proto</font>

85
00:03:46,889 --> 00:03:50,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">class to be TCP the source port has to</font>

86
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:57,109
be 80 and destination port is of course

87
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:59,910
the high parts so a traffic report is

88
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:03,959
what the tool uses describe the traffic

89
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,459
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this contains this list the the</font>

90
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,690
significant traffic clusters and of

91
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,500
course the traffic of each of these

92
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,930
clusters it describes only the large

93
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,549
ones so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a tool that will give</font>

94
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,280
you that the heavy hitters that the

95
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">large clusters of the traffic in your</font>

96
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,320
network and it uses a compression rule

97
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:24,219
to remove redundant clusters and an

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">example we play that up</font>

99
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,740
in a slider<font color="#E5E5E5"> too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so here you have a</font>

100
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,830
simple example for<font color="#CCCCCC"> four plus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

101
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,990
selection the numbers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the circles are</font>

102
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:36,880
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> individual IP</font>

103
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,970
addresses at the bottom as you go higher

104
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,600
on the slide you have the IP addresses

105
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:46,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">and then / that you want / 30 / Tony</font>

106
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,650
night and the / 28 at the top right so

107
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,300
of course putting all this information

108
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,969
in front of the user would be too much

109
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the first step we take is to apply</font>

110
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,210
this threshold in operation which keeps

111
00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:03,970
only say the notes that are about 100

112
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:07,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can see here that the 10200 dot</font>

113
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">8 is among the large notes but but the</font>

114
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,719
one immediately left to it is not

115
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,330
because it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> have enough traffic but</font>

116
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,550
the more general / 29 is in the in the

117
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,960
report so this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> stress holding</font>

118
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,020
achieves talking about the traffic a

119
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,280
drive granularity but this is not all we

120
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,690
also have this compression operation and

121
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,849
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the / story one that</font>

122
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:30,550
includes the two IP addresses that are

123
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,470
large gives you no extra information

124
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,910
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic is exactly the sum</font>

125
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,440
of the other two so it's not worth

126
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:38,380
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about if you don't put it into</font>

127
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,479
the report the next one has more traffic

128
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,520
but the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not big enough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

129
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,599
matter so you don't put into that it

130
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,669
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic report now the / 29 has</font>

131
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,190
a traffic that's larger than the sum of

132
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,659
the other two we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know about by</font>

133
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,580
more than a hundred so it's worth

134
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,620
mentioning<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the report that there's</font>

135
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,930
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more going on in that / 29</font>

136
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:01,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">than those who IP addresses we already</font>

137
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">reported so that's that's the principle</font>

138
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:08,070
of compression that the two deal is on

139
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:10,659
now the tool actually doesn't report

140
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,120
trees like that but puts the results in

141
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,650
a tabular from like this and and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

142
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,750
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example where you have a single field</font>

143
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">but again the tool does multi-field</font>

144
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:22,090
traffic reports and then that's I think

145
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:26,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">an important feature so let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go into</font>

146
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,760
the tool itself it presents<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this</font>

149
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,739
through these many reports you can you

150
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,680
have an interactive drill down feature

151
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,169
and then you have this this powerful

152

feature of defining traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> categories</font>

153
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:46,039
so this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing that requires</font>

a user involvement everything else is

00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,419

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,969
come up with some initial values of this

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,130
categories of traffic you want to look

202

<font color="#E5E5E5">at and then define them from there on</font>

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,930
and there's there's a category called

these traffic clusters there's also this

possibility so you can drill down into

210

each of these categories so not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

that you get the report that describes

also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this possibility of using the</font>

filters out everything that's outside

230
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,110
on a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traces and then we found</font>

231
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:04,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting things mostly we</font>

232

were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to characterize the regular</font>

233
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:10,490
traffic mix and we had some automatic

234
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:13,430
analysis of unexpected events so let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

235
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,620
just point out here that we were we saw

236
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:18,410
conspicuous things such as huge backups

237
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,339
and we saw their<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine patterns and peaks</font>

238
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:23,689
at midnight and so on any point out here

239
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,029
that this is a different view this

240
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:28,940
doesn't measure the traffic as<font color="#E5E5E5"> byte is</font>

241
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:30,589
measured see that it as flow so those

242
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,870
huge backups are nowhere because those

243
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,880
use few connections in this kind of view

244
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,800
you can see things such as scanning or

245
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,079
denial of service attacks with fake

246
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses so this is a useful and in our</font>

247
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,529
case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't see any denial of service</font>

248
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:44,599
attacks you saw this constant<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannon</font>

249
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:46,339
scanning coming from<font color="#CCCCCC"> kada which was a</font>

250
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,860
mapping project mapping the internet

251
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:54,589
with a lot of scanning so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

252
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:56,070
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an unusual event that got</font>

253
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:58,020

255
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:02,670
Sapphire SPL worm so again this report

256
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,480
makes it pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that there's a lot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that general is rather forum traffic so</font>

261
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,900
in this particular setting it gave the

262
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:24,990
IP addresses of the computers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

though it's a general purpose tool it

267

or better traffic policing and it can

also give insight into<font color="#E5E5E5"> unusual events</font>

such as this worm<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakout and then we</font>

281
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,540
also saw stuff such as routing changes

282
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,459
for example just by looking at the

the link we monitored so let me just

00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:18,960
outline the benefits with respect to

multi-field aggregation so not just

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,080
source IP summaries or your destination

289
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,780
IP some resource or sport s it does

290
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,510
reports that span all this and it

291
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:33,630
catches things that single field reports

292
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:35,550
could not catch it automatically<font color="#E5E5E5"> finds</font>

293
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,170
the right granularity to talk about the

294
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,410
traffic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have to say whether</font>

295
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:43,589
you want IP address or / 24 / 16 it

296
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:45,600
finds the natural granularity based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

297
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:49,800
the actual traffic mix and and it has

298
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,810
this drill down which I believe to be a

299
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,270
pretty useful drilling down into

300
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:57,150
categories or using filters of drilling

301
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:00,240
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> whichever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> direct direction you want</font>

302
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to and that's all I had to say except</font>

303
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,850
that it is downloadable from that URL

304
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,570
but it's it's a beta version so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> might</font>

305
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,000
have a few bucks left

306
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:12,460
they're so don't don't be surprised if

307
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:20,620
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything works exactly right thank</font>

308
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:23,350
you very much hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like susan</font>

309

has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question from email or yeah does</font>

310
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:31,690
the tool looks excellent is it output to

311
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:35,730
RR d yes it uses rrd as it's a graphing

312
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:38,710
engine so actually you twist oh lardy

313
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:42,520
because it relies on ir d to produce

314
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:44,230
these plots so all these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> produced</font>

315
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,660
through our as your<font color="#E5E5E5"> artifact these are</font>

322
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,770
