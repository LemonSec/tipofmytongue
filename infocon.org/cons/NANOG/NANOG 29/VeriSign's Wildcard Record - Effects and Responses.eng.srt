1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,230
ok so I'm are clusters and I work for

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,389
verisign and I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on this</font>

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,849
shirt and I'm putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the shirt</font>

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,340
because it's red not to show solidarity

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:17,880
with some what some of y'all<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and</font>

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,279
that because it's a PR ploy for verisign

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,930
but is because if one of you throws a

8
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:29,910
tomato at me at least I'll be

9
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:31,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">color-coordinated it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually because</font>

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:37,380
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a job</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with marriott is the</font>

11
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,790
event staff so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I began there's a</font>

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,460
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of facets that are involved with</font>

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:44,100
site finder and but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,950
hit upon some of the technical issues as

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,379
randy said verisign has not done

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,719
anything strictly against spec this is a

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:52,649
social and business issues and there's a

18
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,719
lot of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are kind of</font>

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:57,120
intertwined here and what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to do</font>

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,800
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss just the technical issues</font>

21
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,949
than the service issues associated with

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,048
it and questions the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> net of it</font>

23
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:08,009
other than technical you really need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

24
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:11,570
be asked in other forms so what I'd like

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today is what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sciFinder</font>

26
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,570
how did we implement it some technical

27
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,460
questions raised DNS while got caught

28
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:25,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">wildcard guidelines and then take</font>

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,750
questions afterwards so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is verisign</font>

30
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,790
site finder well what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:33,180
no surprise to most you<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just to make</font>

32
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:36,720
sure we use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS wildcard a record in</font>

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,610
the common that sounds and it only comes

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,829
into play for non-existent domains and

35
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,740
the answer you received from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gTLDs</font>

36
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,520
servers at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Majid sis is synthesized by</font>

37
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,369
the server and therefore the client

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,798
cannot tell if this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a actual response</font>

39
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,180
received from the wild card itself you

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,479
would have to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> other means to do so</font>

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,619
it matches any number of labels so if

42
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,630
you go WWF Ubar calm calm calm calm

43
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,840
whatever it will match that if that

44
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:11,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular domain did not exist and it</font>

45
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,300
is RFC compliant but this has been part

46
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,500
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rfcs and ever since the beginning</font>

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:20,890
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been 10 3 4 and 10 35 + and so</font>

48
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:24,490
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the intent of bringing this on was</font>

49
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:27,100
to provide a web search service and what

50
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,380
it tries to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is try to match domain</font>

51
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:31,780
names with known known known registered

52
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,600
aims or if that doesn't work offer other

53
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,190
search alternatives and I'm also going

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,910
to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon and show you some stats on</font>

55
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:42,100
that after a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit so now as</font>

56
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,380
president lies this is not a new service

57
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,650
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of TL DS that have done</font>

58
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:50,049
this for many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some research</font>

59
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:54,010
we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has been around since as</font>

60
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:57,460
early as<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1980 1998 and perhaps earlier</font>

61
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:03,459
in the TLD space and many of them are

62
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:06,460
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there some biz us and so on bcccc on</font>

63
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:09,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">yadda yadda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yadda all have tested or</font>

64
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,070
deployed wall cards in their TLD zones

65
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,380
and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want you to take</font>

66
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:16,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">home from this as you go forward is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

67
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,769
so much focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> on verisign but look at</font>

68
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,170
this overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there's many other</font>

69
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:22,989
registries that are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

70
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,299
providing this type of service so you

71
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of bear that in mind as you</font>

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:30,070
go forward so one of the things it would

73
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:34,060
be also useful as sex act which I'm also

74
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:35,799
part of is a call for registries to

75
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,970
provide data from their behalf so that

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:44,790
they can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> sex act understand what</font>

77
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:47,260
all the issues are in a qualitative way

78
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">sick sack is I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> secure the</font>

79
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:54,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">instability committee thank you so the</font>

80
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:55,900
sciFinder implementation before all this

81
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,959
began a bunch of the techies got

82
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:01,690
together and wrote the details of what a

83
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,720
service ought to look like in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

84
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,609
public white paper and if there's enough

85
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,980
interest maybe that should become an RFC

86
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:10,690
because it gives some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of uniform</font>

87
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">characteristics that one may want to</font>

88
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:16,238
provide as part of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wild called service</font>

89
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:18,149
we also did testing prior to launch this

00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not something that came out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of there</font>

91
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:25,299
and after launch there was a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

92
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,669
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that came up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list right</font>

93
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,409
and we established a technical review

94
00:04:27,669 --> 00:04:32,948
panel to look over some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the issues</font>

95
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:34,690
that came up and their findings are or

96
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,750
at least that the names are there some

97
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,590
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the findings were actually given at</font>

103
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:56,680
find very interesting is at the onset we

104
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,210
are under some rather severe denial of

105
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:03,460
service attacks they came various

106
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">flavors some was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the gist the various</font>

107
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,758
sorts in attacks that one sees some of

108
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,969
them were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more interesting</font>

109
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:11,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's some Apache bucks that</font>

110
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:15,370
can be tickled through some specially

111
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:18,280
crafted<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs and there's also a problem</font>

112
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,169
with painted domains a number of attack

drones are waiting to communicate to

116
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,750
and that created a huge amount of

117
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:38,830
traffic going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our site you'll see in</font>

118
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:41,110
a second so 98 / 7 98.7 percent of all

119
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,650
the traffic going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sci fi or an issue</font>

120
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:50,199
was HTTP but as we went through solving

121
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:52,870
these issues things changed so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

122
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,789
took care<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the viruses and denial</font>

123
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:58,889
service attacks and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> creche allah</font>

124
00:05:54,789 --> 00:06:01,479
crafted urls that tickle Apache servers

125
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:03,009
we have some fairly interesting

126
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:04,960
statistics they have come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

127
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,789
and you look here you'll see that

128
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">eighty-five</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the connection</font>

129
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:14,229
attempts are for HTTP or smtp and this

130
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:16,300
is since this is not a grenade so this

131
00:06:14,229 --> 00:06:19,770
gives you a fairly reliable sort of

132
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,940
percentage in terms of what's hitting us

133
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,340
for the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were not</font>

134
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">listening to we issue a tcp reset for</font>

you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> peewee i issued ICMP port</font>

136

unreachable and you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

137
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:36,930
the remaining protocols aside from HTTP

138
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,930
and smtp was basically in the noise

139
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,050
now here's a daily at representation of

140
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,430
the daily traffic at the side finder and

141
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:46,890
you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this first part going</font>

just going going on with the issues i'm

211

going to go on through this fairly

issue and from what we've seen and we

231
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:40,589
did some empirical testing on this is

232
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,740
that most spammers have moved on from

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,540
surveyed 20 million

00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:08,550
common net domains and point<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh seven</font>

243
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,569
seven percent had this particular issue

244
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:14,579
so what was more common as MX with no

245
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:17,160
non-routable address is at six point one

246
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:20,450
three five percent and that's at those

247
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:28,290
item addresses are enumerated in RFC

248

249
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:33,540
is it's much lower than that another

them in that they didn't catch this

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,550

303
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,890
and I was asked to talk a little bit

304
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,449
about some of the workarounds that

305
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:23,130
appeared in some of the issues around

306
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:24,750
the responses to side finder can't talk

normal functioning of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS what you</font>

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,340
see a<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal answer here's the data you</font>

329
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,430
there were some political and business

surprised people woke up the world was

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:49,579
different in some wide-ranging ways they

337
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,640
didn't feel they could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about</font>

of other public sector infrastructure

do with bind as a prominent<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

some response our relevance and success

347
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:24,110
depend on responding to the technical

community and the technical community

349
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:30,620
was very<font color="#CCCCCC"> negative about sciFinder</font>

particularly right away<font color="#CCCCCC"> workaround</font>

351
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:36,320
started appearing pretty much

352
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:39,080
immediately you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know by the time we had</font>

353
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,920
even started talking over and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

354
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,870
customers wanted unofficial patches to

355
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,760
translate the obvious thing to do was

356
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,640
translate a certain address they all

357
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,110
hack around a particular IP address

tail<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeez other addresses was a bad</font>

362
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:07,069
answer another workaround that we talked

363
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,280
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> early on and implemented as</font>

364
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:14,329
delegation only is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it gave the</font>

365
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:18,049
administrator the ability to record what

366
00:17:14,329 --> 00:17:19,639
could to only see referral data for a

certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> tail day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well for any domain</font>

368
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:25,819
really it meant that normal answers that

369
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,330
weren't referrals would get turned into

370
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,799
our code<font color="#CCCCCC"> three this was released as a</font>

of days now<font color="#CCCCCC"> frankly everybody that works</font>

373
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,880
on by nine was working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on making sure</font>

374
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we could do this and make it make</font>

375
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,950
it work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make it correct this is not</font>

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">bynes default behavior it's a tool</font>

378
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:54,679
placed in the hands of administrators

379
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:59,389
who want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sort of a refinement</font>

380
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:02,929
on this another another workaround would

381
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:06,250
be to explicitly enumerate which<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds</font>

382
00:18:02,929 --> 00:18:09,320
you want to accept non referrals from

383
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,280
wheel is common exceptions you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

384
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,010
it's part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bind product</font>

385
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,960
documentation this is an even more

386
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,600
powerful knob for the administrator and

387
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,660
we seriously recommend being very very

388
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:22,730
careful about deploying those it's not

389
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">binds default it's not going to be binds</font>

391
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:33,549

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:35,928
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it there was another</font>

393
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:39,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">workaround that we brought out for</font>

394
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:40,490
buying blind date users that didn't have

395
00:18:39,169 --> 00:18:42,500
the equivalent of delegation only a

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">route delegation only it's selectively</font>

397

forwarding frankly I personally I'm glad

398
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,639
this isn't widely used I don't think

399
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:54,200
it's I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good it's a</font>

400
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:56,770
hack there are some other workarounds we

401
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:00,919
saw people using that frankly scared

402
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:02,389
scared a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more anybody who</font>

00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:05,210
runs local network infrastructure can

404
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:08,590
advertise their own instance of the IP

signs data but local<font color="#E5E5E5"> content it</font>

408
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:22,490
introduces incoherency but again people

409
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:27,260
are seeing some local advantage and some

410
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:29,800
people are doing those the workaround to

411

remap our code<font color="#E5E5E5"> three to a local server</font>

412
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:36,260
again people can do this they're seeing

413
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:39,379
less reason not to this has actually

414
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,540
been observed it's not a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

415
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:43,270
in some ways it certainly isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

416
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:48,020
do much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a coherency of the DNS</font>

417
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:50,090
locally or globally these are the other

applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've heard a lot of</font>

difference in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model between the</font>

is a clear intent transport in the core

00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:51,580
and all the richness is at the edge as

492
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,190
opposed to the telco where if I want to

<font color="#E5E5E5">implement a new feature I have to change</font>

495
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:06,158
remind<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that ports such as port 25</font>

496
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:10,120
and port 80 were once not used and then

497
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:13,630
seen very little and today email and the

498
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,090

who cares let the suckers die is not

501
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:31,030
really what many of us think of is the

internet and so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> all those</font>

503

protocols and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage that may be</font>

00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:43,090
all of us and

506
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:46,880
that the problem really isn't the DNS

507
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:49,550
the DNS specifications are being

508
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,000

511
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:01,360
putting hacks in server code the problem

didn't get any operational coordination

539
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:25,370
on this actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this question came up</font>

at this sex act meeting that Randy so

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:31,639

542
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,669
that Chuck gums gave was it was done on

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,780
on business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> competitive reasons why</font>

544
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:41,030
there was no notice given and it again

545
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,310
that's not without precedent<font color="#E5E5E5"> because New</font>

START did that without business a couple

547
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:51,200
months earlier so but recognizing the

size of<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm I guess I'd have to say so</font>

549
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,290
is that the policy going forward

550
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:58,480
it well no it's it's actually not a rut

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:55,450
when I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to quantify what</font>

570
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:59,620
kind of advance notice we would get

571
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:03,220
basically gave a<font color="#CCCCCC"> non answer it I i think</font>

572
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,610
that there's a that this stuff is all

573
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:10,600
been evolving over time and it there's

574
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:12,550
been more recent thinking that we would

575
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,280
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the community and turn</font>

576
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:16,870
it and this is a positive thing right is

577
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,510
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

578
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,209
in terms of what is appropriate time

579
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">warning time to put out new services if</font>

580
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:27,430
you'd like my suggestion it's the length

581
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:34,810
of the verisign contract plus a day my

582
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:38,620
second clapping my second question<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

583
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:40,360
you said on your slide policy questions

584
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:46,419
are more appropriately directed to

585
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:50,159
another forum which form so what were

586
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,160
their paws or is that a policy question

587
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,549
that a more appropriate venue for that

588
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:04,950
sort of thing maybe I can all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

assumption that John referred to and

594
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:24,299
then I've heard many many other places

595
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,860
quantifying if at all possible what

596

difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does make whether it's a</font>

for best practices or a community

00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:35,850
response on this so certainly any way of

601
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,299
characterizing the difference between

602
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,668

right I I had a few feel free to corner

608
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,970
them I had a few questions I guess I'll

609
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:58,530
just ask one I'm wondering why<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

610
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:06,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's okay for you to raise my spam rate</font>

612
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:12,299
it well my group took a look at this and

613

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,289
gal is it forty percent is it 55

616
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:21,120
percentage that three percent but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

617
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:29,850
it's a number i just thought i'd bring

618
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:32,280
to the table well for me I mean my<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye i</font>

619
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:35,870

anywhere after Randy's observation the

one of the comments by people from

665
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:37,200

error analytically seemed seems likely

668
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,710
from your review panel is that some

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,390
software changes might be necessary mark

670
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:51,059
you noted that post fix was going to

if if one makes this change to the MX

either there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple caveats let me</font>

676
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,320
start over again if there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wild-card</font>

710
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:11,080
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can move more possible more</font>

711
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:13,540
positively in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future on and again</font>

712
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,279
this I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a time that the</font>

713
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,099
community can come together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey</font>

714
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,410
look we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be reasonable and</font>

715
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:22,780
this is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we like to see and so this</font>

716
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,339
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity for everybody to come</font>

717
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:35,589
together and say this is what we like to

718
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:39,190
see going forward anyone else going once

719
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:41,259
going twice no no no you're not in the

720
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:44,230
you're not in the oh I'm sorry this is

721
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:47,200
nanog are you from a North American area

722
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:49,780
at all Hughley as an observer purely as

723
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,290
an observer okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay my name is Bruce</font>

724
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Campbell from the ripe NCC I've got more</font>

725
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:59,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an observation was that I can</font>

726
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually speak into the microphone a lot</font>

727
00:35:59,589 --> 00:36:05,849
of the talk and so forth about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole</font>

728
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:08,470
verisign wild card and site finder its

729
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:09,970
first of all it's as Suzanne said it's

730
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,560
the principle of least surprise has been

731
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:14,319
violated because we didn't get the

732
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:16,420
notification accept whatever you said

733
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,640
for the reasons that one of the other

734
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:24,089
things there there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of people</font>

735
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,089
that simply do not trust verisign

736
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:34,009
so a lot of the comments there you know

737
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:36,770
we will do an MX wild cut that points to

738
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,890
an unreachable how do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that that</font>

739
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:42,110
one will always<font color="#E5E5E5"> point to an unreachable</font>

740
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:44,839
have another thing is how do we know

741
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:48,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">that verisign will not do something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

742
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:52,340
the data there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of verisign is</font>

743
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:56,600
saying trust us the question is can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

744
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:59,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're verisign yeah just the</font>

745
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:01,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">same way we can trust</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ripe ncc not to</font>

746
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:05,900
relief your data or share it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ripe</font>

747
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:09,290
NCC is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sound boat right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

748
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:11,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">so um have her lots of really</font>

749
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:15,830
constructive comments that have come in

750
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:17,810
various forms right and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

751
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:19,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">things has come regarding the privacy</font>

752
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:21,799
issue is that there's third parties that

753
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:25,850
actually do audit your compliance to

754
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:28,100
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

755
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:29,600
i would recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> going forward is that</font>

756
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,580
you have some third-party that audits

757
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,940
these things and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> true with lots</font>

758
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:37,250
of other places<font color="#E5E5E5"> that geeks really just</font>

759
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:41,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really trust Microsoft is yet</font>

760
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:43,040
another example right mark no matter how

761
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,740
well-intentioned or how much Fair

762
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,290
assigned is to uphold whatever privacy

763
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:52,479
policies you've created a really

764
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:55,220
attractive target for government abuse

765
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,690
George Jones with my turn I just one

766
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,970
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of comment if there is a soon</font>

767
00:37:56,690 --> 00:38:01,310
behavior or historical behavior and

768
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:02,899
there are trust issues with Microsoft my

769
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:09,440
suggestion would be somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft on</font>

770
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:14,150
RFC and remove the ambiguity<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think</font>

771
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:16,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a useful thing i I'm guard</font>

772
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">Maxwell and I've got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little question</font>

773
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:20,720
since the site finder service<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

774
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:22,610
only addresses the HTTP service and its

775
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,589
results right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now everything else is</font>

776
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:27,110
just it's trying not to break you know

777
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:29,420
smtp why not leave that logic in the

778
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:41,480
application rather than putting it

779
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:43,220
the DNS system so you want me to but

780
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,839
what's or answer do you want from this

781
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,779
right but what's your position on that I

782
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,250
mean if you're only serving one service

783
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,720
why isn't that functionality being left

784
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:54,920
to the application why is it being put

785
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,180
into the DNS system<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is</font>

786
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,960
actually going a little bit beyond my

787
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:01,069
realm right in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of okay there okay</font>

788
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,720
actually I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna go on a rant here I</font>

789
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:06,920
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way of doing it</font>

790
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,149
so okay I'm a researcher I have 40

791
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,829
seconds for my rant so I'm going to

792
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:15,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">speak really fast I can't do as fast as</font>

793
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:16,670
Casey but I will try so what what what's

794
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,410
happening as internet it's become

795
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,480
successful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of things have yet</font>

796
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:22,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done that haven't been done one of</font>

797
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that hasn't been done yet is</font>

798
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:27,339
actually created directory service that

799
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:29,149
actually works right and in

800
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:31,609
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in this double</font>

801
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:33,290
kratika double critical mass problem

802
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:34,819
where people aren't willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up</font>

803
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,849
the services because there's no clients

804
00:39:34,819 --> 00:39:39,650
clients are willing aren't lonely to be

805
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:43,520
developed by software vendors because

806
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:46,430
there's no demand so we see we're

807
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,619
communists crux right now of trying to

808
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:52,098
provide better sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet service</font>

809
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:54,650
and right now you know teaching HTTP

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something I look forward to so I</font>

812
00:39:57,049 --> 00:40:01,190
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's incumbent on all of us and</font>

813
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:03,109
figure out let's go forward and find

814
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,750
better ways here's one here's one

815
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:08,900
possible Avenue that that some people

816
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:15,530
don't like let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a better just find</font>

817
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:18,049
a better one thank you would you have

818
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:22,400
preferred a wild card adapter wrecker to

819

a wild card a<font color="#CCCCCC"> nit sorry rhetorical</font>

820
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,089
question films let me give perhaps a

821
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:31,490
speculative answer that mark can't to

822
00:40:29,089 --> 00:40:35,420
that last question which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> why not do</font>

823
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:37,098
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the application layer this is to</font>

824
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,720
some degree already being done at the

825
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:41,660
application layer this has been

826
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,209
estimated by some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be about 100</font>

827
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,368
million bail

828
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:47,580
are your revenue stream and that is

829
00:40:44,369 --> 00:40:50,970
being split by<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> netscape</font>

830
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:54,210
right now and so it's again a question

831
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:59,279
of competition not a question of

832
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:04,140
technical merit at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

833
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,700
that's one answer I don't know how much

834
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that relates to reality but that's an</font>

note um if verisign is playing the card

849
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:52,200
of we are independent trusted party and

850
00:41:50,369 --> 00:41:54,240
that's why you should trust us with your

private information your email bounces

852

questions I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lay out something</font>

what you send in liberal and what you

accept practice a liberal layer 7 and

868
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:47,069
that moreover it violates the principle

869
00:42:45,059 --> 00:42:50,130
of least user astonishment and that it

870
00:42:47,069 --> 00:42:52,049
would probably be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at pardon good</font>

871
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:56,099
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address this in the standards</font>

872
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:57,630
process so that any place in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

873
00:42:56,099 --> 00:43:01,220
hierarchy where there was a customer

874
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:04,559
vendor relationship or a delegation that

875
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:08,819
wild carding was expressly discouraged

876
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:11,039
and so the speculative question is if

877
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:14,670
this were in fact addressed in the

878
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:17,309
standards process what would Vera signs

879
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,410
response be would verisign believe that

880
00:43:17,309 --> 00:43:21,539
they are bound by this sort of thing or

881
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:31,078
would they say well you know doesn't

882
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:34,910
apply to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> so okay so as I look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

883
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:38,039
is usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're bound by contract and</font>

884
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:40,470
these sort of things need to be bound<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

885
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:43,289
contract but there's also sort of social

00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:44,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsibility I know you guys are kind</font>

was Custer<font color="#CCCCCC"> sanger but there's a part of</font>

889
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:55,049
it too and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that these things all</font>

890
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:56,579
need to be put in consideration no

891
00:43:55,049 --> 00:44:01,230
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a net that I don't think</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a no thing can you elaborate on</font>

893
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,400
it a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than just well it a</font>

Chuck Gomes again

896
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:13,060
okay so i'm not really the sort of

897
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:16,930
figure 2 for you to ask that question

898
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:22,599
too<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that that's a fair enough</font>

specify<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns standards so it if one once</font>

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,190
free to do that we don't mind if people

912
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:59,859
do that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the wild card back</font>

915
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:15,040
not going to see an arms race are doing

916
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:19,060
to start the arms race now again you're

917
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,099
asking a speculative question and so and

918
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:22,750
I stayed at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least on my end I can give a</font>

919
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:24,190
speculative answer but I don't think

920
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:29,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be sufficient so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

921
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:33,160
think i will it but it might my sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

922
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,420
is okay and you're gonna go we like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

923
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:37,680
would you like me to channel mark

924
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">coster's channeling psycho</font>

925
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:43,520
so you guys you also need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you need to</font>

926
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:46,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">it you need to realize</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm a tacky</font>

927
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,440
just like you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in authority is</font>

928
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:51,920
made by others that are within my

929
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:58,490
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to answer</font>

930
00:45:51,920 --> 00:46:01,420
is it is it the community is actually is

931
00:45:58,490 --> 00:46:05,990
important to us it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and</font>

932
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,670
these things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at we have to</font>

933
00:46:05,990 --> 00:46:10,640
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the best solutions and</font>

934
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:13,490
one of the things is and I'll go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

935
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,650
it this call for for analysis by the

936
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,450
security and stability committee to look

937
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:18,830
at this I think it's a very important

938
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,509
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because that right now</font>

939
00:46:18,830 --> 00:46:23,180
there's no arms race gets its done on

940
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:25,010
and if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> does come on again there's</font>

941
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:29,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be some sense of adequate</font>

942
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:31,340
notice and it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful again for</font>

943
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:33,200
having some sort of attic you know for

944
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:38,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">us to define what adequate notice</font>

945
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:41,299
actually is there are three people<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

946
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:42,560
the microphones four if you count me

947
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,300
because I have a question Suzanne is

948
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,610
lonesome everyone's asking picking on

949
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,100
mark I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick on Suzanne the break</font>

950
00:46:46,610 --> 00:46:55,490
is out there the coffee is getting cold

951
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:58,880
so i would suggest for me I don't mind

952
00:46:55,490 --> 00:47:00,049
if you guys get up and leave if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

953
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,400
to stick around and ask questions I

954
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:04,850
think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold these folks up here at</font>

955
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:07,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> table so go ahead Owen DeLong tellme</font>

956
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:09,980
networks you say that you're bound by

957
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:13,370
your contract and yet at least in

958
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">ICANN's interpretation the wild card was</font>

959
00:47:13,370 --> 00:47:17,690
in violation of the contract and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

960
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:20,000
sent you notice of such which is what

961
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:21,860
finally caused you to turn it off now

962
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,870
Chuck Gomes has again been saying that

963
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:28,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys basically intend to turn it</font>

964
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">back on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again with some level of notice</font>

965
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:37,730
mumble won't say when so given that it

966
00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:39,200
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> like verisign either doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

967
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:42,170
the same opinion of what the contract

968
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,490
says as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can does or doesn't actually</font>

969
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:48,590
really feel all that bound by it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:51,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">really think that's a lawyer question on</font>

971
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:55,190
that lawyer so I can't answer it

976
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:08,240
words abusive power were ever mentioned

977
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:15,170
in internal discussions of verisign if

978
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:16,839
you can give<font color="#CCCCCC"> that answer there there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

979
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:20,090
there was a lot of discussion about

980
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:21,770
turning on this service and there was a

981
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:23,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of was the</font>

984
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is that one of</font>

the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> missteps made was at a lack of</font>

00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:47,540
adequate notice thank you mike o'connor

987
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,160
SGI one question were there were<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

988
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:51,170
ever any thoughts about providing a

989
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:53,960
directory service for things other than

990
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:55,520
the web and the same context like it you

991
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:58,100
have a bunch of netbios queries that hit

992
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:02,090
their return something that says so

1000
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,850
of the folks up here so you're asking

<font color="#E5E5E5">about is there an intent to provide or</font>

1002
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:28,370
was there ever an intent to provide a

1003
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:30,830
another different tool um to expand

1004
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:32,480
beyond okay you're directing all sorts

1005
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:35,990
of traffic for things that are non web

1006
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:38,210
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> sciFinder are or to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site binder</font>

1007
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:41,390
IP was there an intent to have something

1008
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:42,800
besides a web server on there for some

1009
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:46,129
of the other protocols that gets

1010
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,050
diverted there so so the thing they

1011
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:50,330
actually guided us was it there's a

1012
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:52,220
guidelines document no it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually on</font>

1013
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:54,259
the site finder website that describes

1014
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,939
what services ought to be on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

1015
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">and what ought not to be and if they're</font>

1016
00:49:55,940 --> 00:50:01,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">not what should the behavior be okay so</font>

1017
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,510
that's in the document okay

1018
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:07,570
wait a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute wait a minute I got one</font>

1019
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,700
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Suzanne I told you I was</font>

1020
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:12,940
saving it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for later I'm keeping her here</font>

1021
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:14,740
without coffee so she can answer my

1022
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:19,360
question and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually applies to</font>

1023
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:21,549
the hard data is C has released software

1024
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,130
which allows people to make local

1025
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:28,330
decisions about what they will respond

1026
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:30,700
with this will impact how the coherency

1027
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:33,160
of the DNS and I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

1028
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,520
kinds of instrumentation need to be

1029
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:39,399
deployed<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that people can find out</font>

1030
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:45,700
who's turned this knob on and how how

1031
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:47,260
deep that penetration goes Adam

1032
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Rothschild and I have a question for a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">verisign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait hang on just a second</font>

1034
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:54,520
Suzanne's answering a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me</font>

1035
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,860
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a question for me</font>

1036
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:00,160
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question he's asking for me cuz</font>

1037
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,660
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> love</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know we know what the</font>

1038
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,279
download figures are but we don't

1039
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,710
instrument bind you know as part of

1040
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,050
distributing it freely we don't

1041
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:10,110
instrument it so that we know who's

1042
00:51:08,050 --> 00:51:14,020
downloaded or what they're using it for

1043
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:16,270
so if you are using any of the

1044
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:18,550
delegation only features we'd actually

1045
00:51:16,270 --> 00:51:21,100
like to hear from you how many users<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1046
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:22,060
you feel free to discuss that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

1047
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,890
know any anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you feel like</font>

1048
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,790
disclosing about whether you're using it

1049
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:28,930
and how because we don't know either

1050
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay now if you want to talk to the</font>

1051
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:33,069
verisign or the ISC people they're

1052
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:34,330
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee it's the break time so</font>

1053
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,480
