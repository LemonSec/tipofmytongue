1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:08,670
Thanks ok this morn I'm going to talk

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a tool that we're building at MIT</font>

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,120
that's hopefully going to be making some

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,859
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your lives easier soon so I don't I</font>

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,890
don't need to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a detailed</font>

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,600
explanation here but the bottom line

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,859
which I'm sure you're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware is you</font>

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,689
know because of the highly flexible

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,449
configurable nature of BGP we think that

10
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:32,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp in addition to being viewed as a</font>

11
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,489
network protocol should also be viewed

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:37,980
someone is a distributed program and

13
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:40,050
this type of you suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we need</font>

14
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,300
practical verification techniques to

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,849
verify that once you've got your router

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,500
is configured or your program written

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,920
when you turn all those routers on

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,879
everything's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go as planned so</font>

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
again you probably know this slide

20
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,500
better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do but let me just</font>

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,899
describe to you my<font color="#CCCCCC"> perception of the</font>

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,559
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the art as far as configuration</font>

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,420
debugging right so operator decides that

24
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,990
he wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort of change</font>

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,260
tweakin<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP policy route map etc at a</font>

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,509
customer makes that configuration change

27
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,470
that configuration changes their logs

28
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,400
sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CBS stiffing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> style tool</font>

29
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:24,630
similar to those that were described

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,790
yesterday everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> seems fine you know</font>

31
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,199
sometime later you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some strange</font>

32
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:30,479
behavior might might appear and that

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,159
that behavior might be hard to link to

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,329
the to any particular change that was

35
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,450
made so the reasoning process that that

36
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:41,699
transpires is something like well when

37
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,170
did this problem start showing up let's

38
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,790
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to roll back the configuration to</font>

39
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,460
the time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we started</font>

40
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,750
seeing that problem sort of revert the

41
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:51,630
configuration hope the problem goes away

42
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:55,320
and and and you know continue tweaking

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,048
right so imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you had to write C</font>

44
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,630
or pearl or anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this right be</font>

45
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,369
hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually get anything done and I</font>

46
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,479
and I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is</font>

47
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,659
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> an appropriate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> programming</font>

48
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,660
environment for operators it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad</font>

49
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,520
hoc it's painful waste a lot of time and

50
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:14,430
people get angry while you're while

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,629
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> these types of tweaks the</font>

52
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:20,610
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that I want to highlight is</font>

53
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:22,019
that type of error checking where you

54
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,310
make a<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

55
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:27,629
everything's all right at the particular

56
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:31,260
time is is is not really optimal right a

57
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:34,799
problem could show up a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

58
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,299
could appear much later than at the time

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
at which the configuration changes made

60
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,650
right a failure could happen at some

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:47,790
point later and cause some that's not

62
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">something to go wrong that was not</font>

63
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,450
apparent at the time of the original

64
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:53,790
configuration change right so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

65
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,470
it you you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some sort of</font>

66
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,970
tool that tells you at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make</font>

67
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,560
the change you know this type of problem

68
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,470
is likely to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some point in the</font>

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,599
future or you know warning you know the

70
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,340
change that you made is not really a

71
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,129
recommended change to make your life

72
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy in the future so we're looking at</font>

73
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,870
building a tool that does a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

74
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:17,010
better better job of verifying what we

75
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,090
call configuration correctness and I'm

76
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:20,640
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

77
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,680
what i mean by correctness and by all

78
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,299
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm open to feedback here I'm just</font>

79
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to throw out some ideas and you</font>

80
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,280
know you may have some ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

81
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you consider to be correct</font>

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,970
behavior<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and I'm definitely open to</font>

83
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,510
feedback there but but I've got some

84
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">ideas that I'll describe and I and I</font>

85
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,720
define correctness in terms of these

86
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,980
correctness properties so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

87
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,019
about verifying configuration

88
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,849
correctness you want to verify it in

89
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,560
terms you know systematically in terms

90
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,420
of you know some set of properties you

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,280
know I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a configuration is</font>

92
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,480
property<font color="#E5E5E5"> a satisfy this property be</font>

93
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,500
satisfied etc then how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go about</font>

94
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,879
verifying whether your configuration

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,709
satisfies this property's well you

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,179
figure out the aspects of configuration

97
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,319
that could affect those properties and

98
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,959
then say you know do those configuration

99
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:08,970
commands on these routers satisfy that

100
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,030
the particular set of constraints that

101
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,250
I've set up for that property now you

102
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,360
can talk about configuration in a number

103
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,918
of ways you could talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you know</font>

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,810
how I got this particular router

105
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:20,250
configured properly have I got this set

106
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,590
of routers in my autonomous system

107
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,600
configured properly are Maya

108
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:27,280
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of my autonomous system</font>

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play nice with routers and</font>

110
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,448
other autonomous systems etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

111
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,919
haven't fully considered all those

112
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,229
questions in particular things that

113
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,299
involve configuration across multiple a

114
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:40,449
esas those are questions that we haven't

115
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:42,130
figured out what to do about but in

116
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:44,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular the tool that we've built</font>

117
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">thus far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then problems that we're</font>

118
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,549
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our configuration problems</font>

119
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,440
that go go wrong inside one autonomous

120
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:54,760
system and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give some examples</font>

121
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:57,430
in a minute but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this talk is</font>

122
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,320
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is it's thinking thinking</font>

123
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,360
about ways to a reason at a higher level

124
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,099
about what goes wrong in configuration

125
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,350
and then building a tool that's based

126
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,700
around that that reasoning framework so

127
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:12,490
that's really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first point let's take</font>

128
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:14,860
a set of existing configuration router

129
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:19,630
configurations and verify that certain

130
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:21,460
properties hold so i should mention that

131
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,789
the tool that we've implemented so far

132
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,948
is meant to sort of chomp on cisco iOS

133
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:29,289
configuration it can be extended to two

134
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:31,030
you know other existing vendors but also

135
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:34,840
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that we have a completely new</font>

136
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,950
configuration language this type of this

137
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,359
type of tool is always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

138
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,500
necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> right you're you're always</font>

139
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,510
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want to be able to chomp on</font>

140
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,950
configuration files and say you know

141
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,360
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know this property</font>

142
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:45,099
satisfied or I've got that property

143
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,660
satisfied so no matter what

144
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:48,010
configuration language comes along we're

145
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,220
always going to want<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of you</font>

146
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:54,010
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher-level validation that what</font>

147
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,300
we're doing makes sense in second

148
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,950
something that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

149
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,180
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to really talk about a lot</font>

150
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,889
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort</font>

151
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:03,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of wax philosophical about at the end is</font>

152
00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:05,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know a lot of verifying</font>

153
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,530
correctness of router configuration

154
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,349
depends on verifying that what I've got

155
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,960
configured in reality jives with the

156
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:15,849
intended behavior of what I want to

157
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,380
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have happen and in order to</font>

158
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:20,440
verify that that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I have to</font>

159
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">have some way of specifying that this is</font>

160
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,289
my intended behavior um so the insight

161
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,669
there is once that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've specified this</font>

162
00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:29,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">intended behavior why don't I use that</font>

163
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,448
specification of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> intended behavior</font>

164
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,520
to actually be the router configuration

165
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:34,749
so talk a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that at</font>

166
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end but mostly I want to talk about</font>

167
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:41,139
how our verification tool works um so

168
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,020
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of first get a little</font>

169
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:46,569
more concrete right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so um talking about</font>

170
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,758
configuration talking about correctness

171
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,620
properties let me just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about one</font>

172
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,339
that I call information flow control um

173
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:57,759
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's sort of examine</font>

174
00:06:54,339 --> 00:06:59,439
a very simple rule let's say autonomous

175
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">system be you know is hearing rounds</font>

176
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,039
from see one of its peers and wants to

177
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:06,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that those routes aren't we</font>

178
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,699
advertised to a well how does this

179
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:11,229
happen today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would argue that the way</font>

180
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:13,120
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this today is is really not the</font>

181
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,430
way we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing things and it's</font>

182
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,439
very error-prone right what's going on

183
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:18,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">is you've got a high-level policy don't</font>

184
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,229
advertise the routes I hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one</font>

185
00:07:18,789 --> 00:07:21,969
period to another peer and i'm

186
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:24,099
specifying that policy in terms of a

187
00:07:21,969 --> 00:07:27,009
mechanism<font color="#CCCCCC"> a route comes in tag it with</font>

188
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,719
this community you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advertise</font>

189
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,360
it to these routers etc it goes over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

190
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:33,099
this router you know if the route has a

191
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular community don't riad ver ties</font>

192
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:36,219
it right so there are a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

193
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:37,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go wrong there right I could</font>

194
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,729
specify the wrong route map I could

195
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,199
forget<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define the community list I</font>

196
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:43,089
could tag the route with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong</font>

197
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,460
community etc and they're all sorts of

198
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:46,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go wrong I mean these</font>

199
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,549
are the types of things that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

200
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:51,248
check at a higher level right at the end

201
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:53,349
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day is the route from C going to</font>

202
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:55,569
be riad ver ties to a and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are all</font>

203
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,669
sorts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of they're all sorts of tricks</font>

204
00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:59,379
that people try to play that fit into

205
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:01,209
this sort of property<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I call</font>

206
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,819
information flow control things like

207
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:06,399
partial peering or prefix propagation

208
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,479
conditional announcements etc you want

209
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,149
to make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when your routes are</font>

210
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,529
coming in being manipulated a certain

211
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,419
way passed on to other routers and

212
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:15,339
eventually sent on to other autonomous

213
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:17,020
systems that things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being passed on</font>

214
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:20,529
in the way that you expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be</font>

215
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:22,330
passed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in addition to</font>

216
00:08:20,529 --> 00:08:25,060
information flow control we've got a

217
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,609
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of properties that that that</font>

218
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:31,240
we suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> our things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that fall into the</font>

219
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,620
realm of correctness properties so I'm

220
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,349
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be labor these points on</font>

221
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,269
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to illustrate that these</font>

222
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:38,289
are sort of the five areas that we've

223
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:40,360
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of highlighted as</font>

224
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:42,549
kind of important things we're routing

225
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,720
configuration can go wrong and I've

226
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:49,209
listed underneath each point examples of

227
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,130
you know configuration mistakes or

228
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:52,359
conceptual<font color="#E5E5E5"> misunderstandings that can</font>

229
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:55,660
cause each<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of these types of</font>

230
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,209
properties to be violated so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

231
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,240
when when we when we're writing our

232
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:02,560
configuration checker and as we as we've

233
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,480
developed it so far<font color="#E5E5E5"> we keep these</font>

234
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,920
properties in mind and try to figure out

235
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay let's say I want to write a check</font>

236
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to you know to make sure that validity</font>

237
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,609
your visibility is violated you know

238
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:15,220
what types of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things affect these</font>

239
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:18,130
properties and how can we write rules

240
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,019
that make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that these prep</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

241
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,319
allow us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say whether or not property</font>

242
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:24,850
a is satisfied or is not satisfied<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

243
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:26,050
so the rest of the talk i'm going to

244
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool that's sort of</font>

245
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,329
motivated around this reasoning

246
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,160
framework which we call<font color="#CCCCCC"> rolex and if the</font>

247
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:38,439
lawyers come after us it'll probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

248
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:39,730
renamed to MIT project<font color="#E5E5E5"> rolex but let me</font>

249
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,889
just sort of describe to you what we

250
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">have so far and then later on in the</font>

251
00:09:41,889 --> 00:09:44,800
talk i'm going to describe to you things

252
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:48,610
we're thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> developing for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

253
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,529
tool and as you see at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

254
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:53,290
slide there there's a URL you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can visit</font>

255
00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:54,880
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us feedback that's one of</font>

256
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:57,160
the reasons I'm here actually is to try

257
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get feedback on what types of you</font>

258
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:04,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">know checks you think are important</font>

259
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:06,069
features bugs try it out etc but for the

260
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,589
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the talk I'm just going to talk</font>

261
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:11,529
about what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> today and what you</font>

262
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:12,730
know what you can download today and and

263
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:16,990
that's that's actually what I've shown

264
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">here basically the tools thus far is a</font>

265
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,370
tool and two parts and the first part<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

266
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">something we call pattern based</font>

267
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:27,420
constraint checker and if you if you're

268
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:29,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with things like yak or or</font>

269
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,680
anything like that that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of matches</font>

270
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">on patterns and then sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of execute a</font>

271
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,779
finite state machine to figure out you

272
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:39,189
know what state the configurations in at

273
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,810
any particular point that's kind of what

274
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pattern based constraint checker is</font>

275
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:43,869
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll describe that a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

276
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,700
detail

277
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,960
in a bit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the other piece is</font>

278
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:52,000
basically working towards that sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

279
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,770
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about information flow and</font>

280
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,339
things like that the example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

281
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:58,900
described<font color="#E5E5E5"> before basically you want to</font>

282
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:00,520
get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level representation of</font>

283
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,740
what's going on in the network and the

284
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:05,140
control flow analyzers basically just a

285
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,490
way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of browsing what you know</font>

286
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,800
what's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the network who's</font>

287
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:11,950
connected to who what route map do I

288
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,180
have configured on this router etc<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

289
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,760
so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this pattern based</font>

290
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:18,640
rule checker first as far as using it

291
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,220
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy it's just as simple</font>

292
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,990
as running the script I've included I've

293
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,930
included a couple examples for the

294
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,190
script in the distribution I mean

295
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,189
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what happens is you run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

296
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:31,839
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run on you run the script oh I</font>

297
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,670
should say also that the tool is

298
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,790
designed to chomp on the configurations

299
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:38,860
offline maybe you could combine it with

300
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,060
some of the functionality that's you

301
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,339
know some of the tools that were

302
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:44,609
described yesterday to run it online but

303
00:11:42,339 --> 00:11:48,730
basically thus far I've designed it to

304
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:51,760
chomp on offline configs<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you run</font>

305
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,440
this script you know it's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> grinds away</font>

306
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,700
and then gives you gives you some errors

307
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,080
I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention that the way the way</font>

308
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we've designed the rules is you can</font>

309
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,200
kind of write them in a way that kind of

310
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,720
makes sense that says if I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

311
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,100
router if I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a router here and our</font>

312
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,570
router there I want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

313
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,330
the constraints between these two

314
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,130
routers are you know are satisfied and

315
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:14,080
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to write rules that are</font>

316
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:15,939
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> across across multiple</font>

317
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:18,850
routers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you an example of</font>

318
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,080
that so here's three examples i'm going

319
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,050
to describe each one of them to you in

320
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,180
turn the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throw in the</font>

321
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:28,180
category of validity and what this rule

322
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,459
what this the output of this this rule

323
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,439
this test is showing is based on a rule

324
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,380
that that has to do with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next-hop</font>

325
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:39,300
self setting so what this rule says in

326
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:41,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">English is if I've got an ebgp session</font>

327
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,279
that session should either have<font color="#CCCCCC"> next-hop</font>

328
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:46,810
self set or the IP address of the loop

329
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,290
back on the other side should be

330
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,790
injected into<font color="#CCCCCC"> my igp right so the reason</font>

331
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,079
I throw that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in validity is obvious</font>

332
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,579
right if you have neither of those cases

333
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:56,270
then you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to route somewhere</font>

334
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,709
inside your is where

335
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:00,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">Robert doesn't know how to get to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

336
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:04,580
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> top so that's bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I should also say</font>

337
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:07,340
that these examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> are there based on</font>

338
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,440
reality but I fictionalized you know

339
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:14,210
router names and a s numbers and IP

340
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,700
addresses to protect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> innocent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

341
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:18,470
so as you can see sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the output you</font>

342
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,020
know you run the this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular test</font>

343
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you see that you know this</font>

344
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:25,310
particular gateway in Atlanta has an EVP

345
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:26,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">session you know next-hop self wasn't</font>

346
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,810
set oh and here we've got an error

347
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,730
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the loopback address that's</font>

348
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,729
on the other side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that session was</font>

349
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:36,110
not injected into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp so then the</font>

350
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,390
next step that output of the next test

351
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:41,030
that I've shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> I throw into this</font>

352
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:43,040
visibility category right so do I have a

353
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:45,199
is there a path but for some reason the

354
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,170
BGP route is not being advertised right

355
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,540
so what this what this test says is if

356
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,670
I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a router that's trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it's</font>

357
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,130
got a BGP neighbor statement to some

358
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,020
other router let's make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

359
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,370
that's an and that's an ibgp session

360
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,350
let's make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somewhere in my</font>

361
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,650
configs I've got a router configured

362
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:05,530
with the loop back of that router the IP

363
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">address that the neighbors that</font>

364
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,819
corresponds to that neighbor statement

365
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:13,310
so first three lines show cases where

366
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know for example you know there's a</font>

367
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,030
router in Boston that's that's trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

368
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,650
that's got a neighbor statement with

369
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,390
this particular IP address but I can't

370
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,699
find any router inside my autonomous

371
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:26,510
system that has the loopback address set

372
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,820
to this IP address etc and then the test

373
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,560
cranks away and it also finds finds

374
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:33,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">other things you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last line</font>

375
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,869
there shows for example that I found a

376
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,160
router where there was no bgp statement

377
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,450
said at<font color="#E5E5E5"> all maybe that's good maybe</font>

378
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,939
that's bad but it's at least something

379
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:43,940
you should know about right perhaps it

380
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,290
violates some assumptions and then there

381
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,790
are things that I would throw into this

382
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,240
determinism category you know is

383
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:54,110
deterministic med set is a best path

384
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,700
prepare router ID set etc and the output

385
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,220
at the on the third test their shows

386
00:14:55,700 --> 00:15:02,240
sort of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what would come out for</font>

387
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:04,250
running that test<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me let me</font>

388
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,180
just describe some details for your inch

389
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,830
you know for those of you who are

390
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,930
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in how this pattern based</font>

391
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,640
checker actually works as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

392
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of based around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this sort of</font>

393
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,180
yak model where you match on a

394
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,940
particular pattern<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

395
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular state depending on you know</font>

396
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,420
depending on what patterns I've seen and

397
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,720
as I mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's easy to spread this</font>

398
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:25,550
across routers in an autonomous system

399
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,560
so it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be difficult to read there but</font>

400
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,630
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the at you know the fsm starts</font>

401
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,760
at the top and it looks for any you know

402
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,950
r1 will basically match on any router

403
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:35,450
looking for a router bgp statement with

404
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:37,820
a particular autonomous system number

405
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,500
that will match<font color="#E5E5E5"> John EAS number and then</font>

406
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,420
a neighbor statement with an IP address

407
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,760
and remote is once I've matched on that

408
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:45,680
statement I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I bind</font>

409
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,560
the loose variables and say I've got a

410
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,520
you know on router in LA I've got a

411
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:55,369
router bgp you know 701 I've neighbor

412
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:58,100
whatever remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever and then I</font>

413
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:59,390
and then I go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph and sort</font>

414
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of figure out what state you're in and</font>

415
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:05,330
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know at particular points you</font>

416
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,400
can sort of hop off and you know either

417
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,650
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this configurations you know</font>

418
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:14,709
for this particular router<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's instead</font>

419
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:17,060
of routers is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not okay so</font>

420
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:19,610
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually specify one of these</font>

421
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,540
these fsms well I've in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tool itself</font>

422
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:25,760
I've I've I've given a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of examples</font>

423
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,959
but presumably you know they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

424
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,700
be a lot of examples that I didn't think

425
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:30,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of or I'm just not aware of because I</font>

426
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,230
don't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I don't configure routers</font>

427
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,670
on a daily basis so I try to make

428
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:37,130
specifying these types of rules

429
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:38,689
particularly easy so this rule that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

430
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:42,530
described with the next top self and

431
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:46,910
making sure the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp the the IP address</font>

432
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:48,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">is injected into the igp etc was the fsm</font>

433
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:50,839
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I showed you on the previous slide</font>

434
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:54,620
and that's that can be written in sort

435
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:58,070
of the it's basically written as a perl

436
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:59,960
module and what what the tool does is

437
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:01,250
provide the finite state machinery and

438
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,170
all you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is sort of write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

439
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:07,849
transitions or or all i have to do

440
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:09,199
rather so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what this 41</font>

441
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,089
lines of code does is basically just

442
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,380
spec out what that fsm looks like what

443
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:14,540
are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes what are the transitions</font>

444
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,439
etc so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is the one that I</font>

445
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:17,059
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shown</font>

446
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,279
from the previous slide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in a</font>

447
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:21,199
particular state if I match on a

448
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,500
particular pattern go to this state I

449
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,059
mean it's it's it's that easy um and as

450
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,589
I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there are things</font>

451
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:29,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I you know that I haven't thought</font>

452
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">of that you you know probably encounter</font>

453
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,690
on a daily basis and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the type of</font>

454
00:17:31,399 --> 00:17:34,639
feedback I'm looking for here<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are</font>

455
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules that you should have or you</font>

456
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:38,330
know if you feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> so inclined to write</font>

457
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:40,519
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> write some of these rules</font>

458
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:44,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself I'd be really happy and I've</font>

459
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:47,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">tried to make that easy so let me just</font>

460
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:48,799
briefly talk about the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> part which</font>

461
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,418
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> call the control flow analyzer and</font>

462
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,549
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point of actually</font>

463
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:56,059
checking high level properties here but

464
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:58,600
i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the tool as it stands is</font>

465
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:00,740
actually something that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful</font>

466
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,480
basically what it does is chop on router

467
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,850
configs and give a high level summary of

468
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,860
what of what the network state is at a

469
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,480
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so it's got a number of</font>

470
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,758
<font color="#CCCCCC">features one is it is it allows you to</font>

471
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,100
to sort of graph the network at a router

472
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:14,840
level and then it the nodes are

473
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,149
basically routers and the edges or

474
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:18,889
import and export route maps labeled

475
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:21,709
with some canonical number so that you

476
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:25,100
know seven here is the same as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

477
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:28,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven on that edge and when I say route</font>

478
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:30,949
maps 7 i'm speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some</font>

479
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:32,750
normalization of what that route map

480
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:34,610
actually does not what it's called so if

481
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,470
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a route map called customer</font>

482
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:38,120
on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York router and a route map</font>

483
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,529
called customer on an LA router but they

484
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do two separate things i'll</font>

485
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:44,389
call that two separate route maps so

486
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,879
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a sort of a again I've</font>

487
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:49,939
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymized a way things to</font>

488
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:51,379
protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> the innocent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but this is sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

489
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,820
a snapshot of just a little piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

490
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:57,110
what that network graph looks like and

491
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,149
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably more useful for for</font>

492
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:01,699
smaller types of networks for larger

493
00:18:59,149 --> 00:19:03,168
types of networks you want to use let me

494
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,090
just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back you want to probably use</font>

495
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:06,769
the second the second part which is this

496
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,570
database backed web interface so what

497
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:10,399
this does<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of chops on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the router</font>

498
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:11,899
configs throws everything into a

499
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:14,479
database and then allows you to sort of

500
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,918
browse that's going on it from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web</font>

501
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,389
and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show you just a brief</font>

502
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">example of the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

503
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:21,168
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with the tool as it stands so</font>

504
00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:23,480
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example you can look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all that all</font>

505
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:25,520
the routers that

506
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,290
I'm sorry all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bgp sessions at a</font>

507
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,780
particular router so you can say give me

508
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,970
give me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bgp sessions at this gateway</font>

509
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,649
router in LA and I'll say oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got</font>

510
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,750
you know two sessions to a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

511
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:37,190
and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the import and export route</font>

512
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,200
maps that you're using on those sessions

513
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,120
and again the palace the route map

514
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,360
numbers are normalized based on on what

515
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,560
they do not what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

516
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,120
other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do is sort of</font>

517
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:48,050
look at you know the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sessions</font>

518
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,570
that you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> your particular</font>

519
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:54,800
autonomous<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems you know we've got</font>

520
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,720
force for bgp sessions off to 1239 let's

521
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,030
see let's see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are right so</font>

522
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,130
you know click down drill down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

523
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,790
what those four sessions are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

524
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:07,700
I've got bgp sessions to 1239 it at

525
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:09,260
these four routers and these are the

526
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,080
import and export route maps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

527
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at so one thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to</font>

528
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,699
highlight here is that it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

529
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:21,170
to see you know differences of you know

530
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:23,900
I treat the incoming routes particular

531
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:26,120
wave at three places but I treat them a

532
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,910
slightly different way at a third plate

533
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,350
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> are at a fourth place so with the</font>

534
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,730
tool that allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is say hmm</font>

535
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,389
well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks different let's let's</font>

536
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:37,550
sort of see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so with it</font>

537
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,740
you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of click down on that and you</font>

538
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:42,320
and you see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what these two</font>

539
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,150
route maps actually are<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then what it</font>

540
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,409
does what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool does is provide you a</font>

541
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:47,060
diff that says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know here's the</font>

542
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,700
here's the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

543
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,740
these two routes um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font>

544
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">may be hard to read even if you can't</font>

545
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,890
see you may not understand what's going

546
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:57,110
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> but as I mentioned I've normalized</font>

547
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,570
the route maps away from what they're

548
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,429
called us to actually what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do so</font>

549
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:04,010
basically what I've done is you know

550
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:05,780
dereference community lists dereference

551
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:07,460
basically dereferenced everything and

552
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,840
sort of said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is this is</font>

553
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the mechanism of what the route</font>

554
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,780
map does and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually run the diff</font>

555
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:18,889
on on those two on those two

556
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:20,540
specifications um so you saw some tools

557
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:22,220
that did config diff yesterday and I

558
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">just want to highlight what the</font>

559
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:26,570
difference is here right so yesterday

560
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,610
they were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about configuration</font>

561
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:31,550
dips in terms of time right I make a

562
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:33,620
change at a particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and I want</font>

563
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,389
to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the difference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between you know</font>

564
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,590
what my what my route matter what my

565
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,029
configurations look like to

566
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,000
day versus what they look like five days

567
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:43,279
ago this is not that this is I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

568
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,750
configuration on a router in LA and I've

569
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,620
got a configuration on a router in New

570
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,799
York and I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what the</font>

571
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,418
difference is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

572
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,820
summarizes what you can do today with

573
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:55,039
the tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to briefly just</font>

574
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:56,450
wax philosophical about sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

575
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,629
that we're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what you might</font>

576
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:01,070
eventually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do so let's imagine</font>

577
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you do if you take that sort of</font>

578
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,408
high-level Network summary like this is

579
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:07,700
your 10,000 foot view of the network

580
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,399
let's actually figure out if we can run

581
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">some constraints or verify properties</font>

582
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:14,600
based on that so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some way of</font>

583
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,520
specifying you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what should</font>

584
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">be going on don't riad ver ties the</font>

585
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,559
routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I hear from pearcy over to</font>

586
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,970
puree let's sort of match that up with

587
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,779
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-level description of what's</font>

588
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,779
going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see if that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

589
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:29,470
matches up with reality so going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

590
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:32,590
our example right as i mentioned

591
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,990
specifying the policy with mechanism is

592
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:37,459
complicated and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get right</font>

593
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:38,990
but how do we actually tell whether this

594
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,490
is doing the right thing or not well we

595
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:44,120
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of specification of what</font>

596
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,320
should be happening and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

597
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,479
key challenge and that's something we

598
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,879
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really figured out one thing</font>

599
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's tricky right is you know it's</font>

600
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,770
easy to say you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peer a and you've</font>

601
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:56,570
got pure see and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want the</font>

602
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:58,100
routes from puree going over to pearcy

603
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,379
and you can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of specify that with</font>

604
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:04,010
with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information flow lattices</font>

605
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,840
etc but it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> more complicated</font>

606
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,190
than than that or at least I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

607
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,500
more complicated than that you should

608
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,270
maybe tell me if I'm wrong but you know

609
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,309
you may want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to treat things differently</font>

610
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,710
based on you know what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s path is</font>

611
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:19,580
what the prefix is it you know what

612
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:21,020
router it's coming in on etc etc and if

613
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,049
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point where specifying a</font>

614
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-level property is as complicated as</font>

615
00:23:23,049 --> 00:23:26,570
specifying the configuration itself then

616
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:28,840
you're in trouble so the real question

617
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:31,850
is how do we make the configuration

618
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,139
specification as simple as possible so

619
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,870
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can check whether these</font>

620
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,520
low-level things are actually happening

621
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:40,129
I mean that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually make it</font>

622
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">easier for network operators to you know</font>

623
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:44,240
say what they mean rather than say what

624
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:46,330
they want to happen when<font color="#E5E5E5"> a route comes</font>

625
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,760
in at a particular router and goes out

626
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,799
router so just to summarize with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

627
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the control flow analyzer does it</font>

628
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,760
basically just<font color="#E5E5E5"> provides a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bird's eye</font>

629
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:56,710
view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the network and allows operators</font>

630
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,870
to view what's going on in terms of

631
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,580
where my EBT piece or where my bgp

632
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:03,870
sessions are what route maps i'm using

633
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,918
where etc and it's fairly navigable um

634
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,889
there's some other things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do as</font>

635
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,029
far as restricting what shows up etc and

636
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,820
there's some things that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

637
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:14,830
sort of immediately one is you know it

638
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,299
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> natural to use this</font>

639
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:18,399
type of thing to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

640
00:24:16,299 --> 00:24:19,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens if I get a route advertised on a</font>

641
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:21,969
particular session<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

642
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:24,070
router where does that route propagate

643
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what attributes get manipulated and</font>

644
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,289
where does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop out what what ebgp</font>

645
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,019
sessions does it come out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

646
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:33,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

647
00:24:32,019 --> 00:24:37,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">have this specification it's natural to</font>

648
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:39,189
say let's not only going to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

649
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">specification to check existing</font>

650
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:42,519
configurations but why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

651
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,130
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> high level specification as the</font>

652
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,809
router configuration language itself so

653
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:49,360
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned that the first set of</font>

654
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:50,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions sort of gets at this problem</font>

655
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,149
right we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make something that's</font>

656
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,659
you know simple for people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> express</font>

657
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:57,219
what they mean yet allows for enough

658
00:24:55,659 --> 00:25:00,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough detail so that you can actually</font>

659
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:01,059
do what you want without without getting

660
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:04,179
burdened with the same type of

661
00:25:01,059 --> 00:25:05,168
complexity<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so finally I just want</font>

662
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:07,389
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank a couple of people who have</font>

663
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,460
provided me with with many helpful

664
00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:13,418
insights on this work Jennifer<font color="#CCCCCC"> rexburg</font>

665
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:14,769
from AT&T and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Randy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush gave me</font>

666
00:25:13,419 --> 00:25:16,480
some advice that hopefully made this

667
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:19,899
talk a little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting for you</font>

668
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,210
guys if it wasn't interesting maybe

669
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:25,989
maybe you can throw some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blame on</font>

670
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:28,659
him too right and finally I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to</font>

671
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:30,639
say that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've got a symbiotic</font>

672
00:25:28,659 --> 00:25:34,720
relationship here right it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

673
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:36,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you've got a problem as far as you</font>

674
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,710
know router configuration causing you a

675
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:40,690
lot of headaches and I've got a problem

676
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:44,230
and that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've still at MIT</font>

677
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:46,960
and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leave eventually so</font>

678
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:49,419
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> work together you give me some you</font>

679
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,889
know feedback as far as you know what

680
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,480
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful in a tool like this what</font>

681
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:55,000
types of problems are real what types of

682
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">things do you want what</font>

683
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,180
you know how can I make your life easier

684
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,370
download<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's download the tool you</font>

685
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,050
know test it out or if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to</font>

686
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:06,699
test it out on your stuff I'd be more

687
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:09,129
than happy to do that I'm more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

688
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,280
happy to you know write tests that you

689
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:13,750
think would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be helpful for your network</font>

690
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,910
I'm an expendable resource at this point

691
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,280
I'm a grad student so I've got time on

692
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:22,680
my hands just let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I can do</font>

693
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to help you and thanks for listening I</font>

694
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:33,850
actually have a question I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

695
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:35,800
I'd have questions today but I do in my

696
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,540
experience which you know God knows I

697
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a network anymore but in my</font>

698
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:43,090
experience I I named route maps things

699
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:45,250
on purpose and so to have a tool that

700
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,199
took those names away and called him

701
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,300
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else even if they didn't do</font>

702
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,640
the same thing would would make them

703
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:53,110
somewhat meaningless to me so is there a

704
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,530
way or have you thought about

705
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:58,870
incorporating both so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I have 52</font>

706
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,280
route maps thats a customer and to me

707
00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:01,449
customers an important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

708
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,040
might do different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it might</font>

709
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:05,020
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to know they do different</font>

710
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,670
things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might also be useful for</font>

711
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,180
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand that those are all the</font>

712
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:11,980
customer route maps yeah i think that's

713
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,020
that's something that would be easy to

714
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:17,170
add yeah that's the type of thing that

715
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,420
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful for us to know the</font>

716
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:22,030
thing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that that I was</font>

717
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">motivated to do it this way is that my</font>

718
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:27,250
hypothesis is that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> occasionally</font>

719
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,990
you know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got sort of a</font>

720
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,760
cut-and-paste type of thing where you

721
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a customer route map I'll</font>

722
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,450
just copy this one and then at some

723
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:37,270
point you know maybe I do some load

724
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:38,530
balancing I make a little tweak and you

725
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,060
know five months later<font color="#CCCCCC"> i come back and</font>

726
00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:41,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">they they appear to be called the same</font>

727
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:43,149
thing you know especially if i'm looking

728
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">at a name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know five neighbor</font>

729
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:46,960
statements<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something where they also</font>

730
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,430
a customer customer you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at a</font>

731
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,620
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> router and I've got customer</font>

732
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,910
there and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might assume that</font>

733
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:53,320
that's the same thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

734
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,779
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's important to see that</font>

735
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,939
it's not

736
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:58,009
but I do i do agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

737
00:27:55,940 --> 00:28:00,889
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that also allows us yeah</font>

738
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:03,229
bollywood alone it would be great yeah

739
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:04,908
but that was that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> motivation yeah</font>

740
00:28:03,229 --> 00:28:07,609
oh I makes total sense but it would be

741
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:09,320
nice to have both because then you could

742
00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:13,158
reconcile what you intended with what

743
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:16,059
you have yeah yeah definitely in the

744
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:21,619
front<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I Owen DeLong tellme networks</font>

745
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:23,809
your rule-based parser or I forget what

746
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:25,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">you called it at the beginning but is</font>

747
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:26,749
playing where you feed the set of rules

748
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,879
in and you feed the config in and it

749
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:32,359
sort of tries to do pattern matching

750
00:28:28,879 --> 00:28:33,709
between them right the the rules that

751
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:35,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to feed into that or the</font>

752
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:37,999
patterns<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to feed into that</font>

753
00:28:35,349 --> 00:28:40,729
is there any possibility of perhaps

754
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:44,539
generating those from our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl or</font>

755
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:45,889
something similar that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best good</font>

756
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:49,789
idea actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I hadn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thought about</font>

757
00:28:45,889 --> 00:28:51,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually in fact one thing that I</font>

758
00:28:49,789 --> 00:28:54,200
didn't mention<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

759
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,609
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that is the sort of manual</font>

760
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:57,259
nature of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write those</font>

761
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:58,999
specifications and that's a big pain in

762
00:28:57,259 --> 00:29:01,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">the neck right so I've thought about</font>

763
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:03,229
ways where maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can kind of infer</font>

764
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:09,169
some of these rules<font color="#E5E5E5"> like let's say</font>

765
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:10,580
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you know let's say you've got</font>

766
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:12,589
it some sort of configuration option

767
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,779
that's turned on on 98 routers and it's

768
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:18,408
off on to maybe you could say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

769
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:20,269
you know let's call that a rule that

770
00:29:18,409 --> 00:29:22,849
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this this thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

771
00:29:20,269 --> 00:29:23,899
turned on in this particular way that's

772
00:29:22,849 --> 00:29:25,908
another way I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought about doing</font>

773
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:28,158
this but but using our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl to generate</font>

774
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:29,479
rules is also a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea yeah because</font>

775
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,499
we're already having to go through that

776
00:29:29,479 --> 00:29:35,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">pain at least some of us the other</font>

777
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:37,129
question I had is currently it looks

778
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:40,820
like you're primarily parsing iOS

779
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:42,320
configs that's correct is there any and

780
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,849
it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you parse those you're</font>

781
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,259
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstracting them as the first</font>

782
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:47,629
step before you do anything else with

783
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:49,909
them that's correct yet trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

784
00:29:47,629 --> 00:29:52,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">Lou it would be nice if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could sort of</font>

785
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:55,219
separate that adaptation layer so that

786
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:58,129
and you know open that process up so

787
00:29:55,219 --> 00:30:00,190
that would be easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you and also for</font>

788
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,019
other people to build sort of module

789
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:04,629
that would allow you to parse other

790
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:07,559
vendors configs yeah that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

791
00:30:04,629 --> 00:30:10,600
excellent um yeah as i mentioned i think

792
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:12,879
i think what we're trying to do is

793
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,360
independent of any router configuration

794
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:18,879
language so that yeah that's definitely

795
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,709
a point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd like to get to and</font>

796
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:22,840
hopefully someone else will write you

797
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:26,529
know config parsers for other languages

798
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,759
because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one of me but yeah</font>

799
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:29,799
getting to that point would definitely

800
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,970
make make that a lot easier so yeah

801
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:35,259
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a great suggestion thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

802
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,789
just had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of take questions on</font>

803
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:38,350
another questions or comments I just

804
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:40,149
wrote<font color="#E5E5E5"> down some and some of them kind of</font>

805
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,250
been covered but one of the things that

806
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:43,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've noticed is that we have some tools</font>

807
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,850
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of syntactically based</font>

808
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,009
like rancid right and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

809
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">weight something like what you're trying</font>

810
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:50,470
to do which is trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring some kind</font>

811
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">of understanding of the semantics of</font>

812
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:56,559
what these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are trying to do right</font>

813
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:58,149
to management of configs right so are we

814
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a track where we're going to have a</font>

815
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:02,110
proliferation of tools or are these

816
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:04,240
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there a place where these</font>

817
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,469
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come together so that you</font>

818
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,600
know I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a unified</font>

819
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:10,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">management of my config space that was</font>

820
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a thought I had while</font>

821
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:14,590
you were talking and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other one was</font>

822
00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:16,178
on and I think I only mentioned this is

823
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,500
that your<font color="#E5E5E5"> trip you know you're</font>

824
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:18,759
developing metal language for router

825
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,990
configuration and we've talked about

826
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,820
this over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> years millions and</font>

827
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:24,340
millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times and we tried to do it</font>

828
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:27,070
with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl and you can argue up and</font>

829
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:29,470
down whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> psl failed or</font>

830
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,939
succeeded or whatever maybe it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was too</font>

831
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,450
ambitious to try to put the database

832
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:36,429
thing there or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know but</font>

833
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:37,990
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that where this is all going that um</font>

834
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:41,350
we think that our vendors are going to

835
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:43,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">supply us um a language like you know</font>

836
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:45,309
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> ansi standardized router language</font>

837
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:47,259
or something like that I you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I</font>

838
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:49,090
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> care who does it I mean but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I you</font>

839
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:50,860
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm saying you know some kind</font>

840
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">of standardized router i mostly currency</font>

841
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,729
so you know some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of standardized</font>

842
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:56,370
router language that they all speak the

843
00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:00,909
same thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they and if we do that</font>

844
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:02,379
then how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i'm just trying to</font>

845
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:04,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">see how that fits into the space of what</font>

846
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:06,428
vendors do which is try to kind of

847
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:07,629
distinguish themselves by value-added

848
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:11,379
while at the same time being

849
00:32:07,629 --> 00:32:12,760
interoperable so I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font>

850
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:15,610
in what you thought the<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct</font>

851
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:19,450
there was so first question first about

852
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:22,000
rancid and things so actually I think

853
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,310
these tools are fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> complimentary and</font>

854
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,320
actually might rather than proliferating

855
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,090
I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually it might make sense to</font>

856
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,850
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about one tool that does all these</font>

857
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:33,730
things I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about what what</font>

858
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,469
rancid does and it's got a lot of I mean

859
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">it tries to tackle a lot of problems</font>

860
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:41,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely very necessary but</font>

861
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,440
it's things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we aren't looking at at</font>

862
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:47,020
all like you know doing mass

863
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,150
configuration you know looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at route</font>

864
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,830
map<font color="#CCCCCC"> tips over time like the whole CBS</font>

865
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,360
thing and looking at differences that's

866
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,399
all very useful and that's that stuff

867
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're not looking at it at all but</font>

868
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,440
you can imagine combining you know

869
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,389
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> what rancid does with things</font>

870
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,810
things like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool does which is</font>

871
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,820
you know you know now I've made a change

872
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:08,679
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you know chomp on it with</font>

873
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,270
with a tool like mine you figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out you</font>

874
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,190
know oh you're likely to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain</font>

875
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,780
problem and then well<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's see what</font>

876
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:18,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've done you know let's see what this</font>

877
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:20,170
looked like in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past exactly just</font>

878
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,460
what many of us do is we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you know</font>

879
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:24,400
crying scripts that run against our

880
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,960
routers so that or a rancid thing and so

881
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,640
at some point it says hey this realm

882
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,230
have changed but that's all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

883
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,680
right right<font color="#E5E5E5"> go anger out what that dude</font>

884
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:34,690
right right right so I mean so I

885
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,860
recognize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's you know something</font>

886
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you want and I think something that</font>

887
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you also want is is something that</font>

888
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,520
actually explains you know this change

889
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,100
and it's likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause x y&z to go</font>

890
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,830
wrong so that's where I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

891
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:50,110
the two tools together could actually be

892
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:52,810
quite useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh so as far as the second</font>

893
00:33:50,110 --> 00:34:01,449
question with with configuration

894
00:33:52,810 --> 00:34:03,280
languages yeah so I'm I guess yeah I'm

895
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:06,040
not sure exactly what all what all i

896
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,909
should say there except that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

897
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:13,540
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to take the position that</font>

898
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:16,929
yeah specifying specifying your policy

899
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:18,790
in terms of you know what the router

900
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,190
should do in terms of when a router

901
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,339
arrives and

902
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:25,200
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> import-export policies etc and</font>

903
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:29,460
actually the mechanism of how a route is

904
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:30,810
manipulated I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know we</font>

905
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">should be moving towards actually</font>

906
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:34,168
specifying the policy in terms of the

907
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:39,089
policy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in terms of the mechanism</font>

908
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:40,888
and yeah so I'm I'm trying to you know

909
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:43,469
get people's attention on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

910
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:47,129
we'll see how far that goes that that's

911
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:50,638
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wanna say Ruettiger okay will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

912
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:55,319
go thought you did ago well okay I have

913
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:58,020
two points one is I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite sure how</font>

914
00:34:55,319 --> 00:35:02,579
close you are actually to getting to

915
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:05,190
some common router language<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the</font>

916
00:35:02,579 --> 00:35:09,119
terms you are describing your tools in

917
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:11,520
terms of not grammars but patterns kind

918
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,470
of kind of hints me that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

919
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting having having actually an</font>

920
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:18,118
abstract model of what you're dealing

921
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:20,069
with which could be mapped into a

922
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:24,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">language for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> describing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ruler</font>

923
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:27,089
configurations on well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I i I'm</font>

924
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,910
asking aha I are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing something</font>

925
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:32,460
there or are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just abstracting from</font>

926
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:35,720
what you're seeing on a particular

927
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:40,130
window and when the next one comes up

928
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:43,649
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reach roof it and while okay</font>

929
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:45,119
okay so i think there's so in my view

930
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:49,170
there's there's two things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

931
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,670
going on one is you've got you've got

932
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,200
kind of what's happening in reality

933
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,760
right these you know these are the

934
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,200
routers that are in your is this is

935
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,089
what's going to happen when<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular</font>

936
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,680
you know route consonants can be read

937
00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,930
advertised here here and here it's going

938
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,049
you know local press can be manipulated

939
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:06,049
med etc right so that's you know you

940
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:09,030
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a high level</font>

941
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:10,710
away<font color="#E5E5E5"> from you know what the cisco iOS</font>

942
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,319
looks like what the juniper looks like

943
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">etc so that's one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

944
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:16,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to want to do that</font>

945
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:20,490
independent of you know whatever the

946
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:22,140
language is right you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know no no matter</font>

947
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:24,299
what's a storage unit or whatever

948
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,799
decides to do in the future you're

949
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to want to be able to sort</font>

950
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,760
of view at a high level what's going on

951
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,930
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of where my routes going</font>

952
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,450
how am i treating this particular AAS in

953
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,419
terms of you know how am i treating its

954
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,470
routes at these different locations etc

955
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:42,120
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's always going to</font>

956
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,830
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful now there's a separate</font>

957
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,960
question you can ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> there right so</font>

958
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:48,150
that's sort of like a representation of

959
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,120
what's going on and<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to ask</font>

960
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,280
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know does that representation agree</font>

961
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:57,690
with what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have happen</font>

962
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,340
so then you can ask you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how so how</font>

963
00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:01,770
do I actually specify what I want to

964
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,690
have happen and that's sort of a

965
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:05,400
language question and something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

966
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:07,350
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have good answers to right now but</font>

967
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that that we</font>

968
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,790
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be thinking about I mean I and to</font>

969
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:14,160
sort of get back to the previous

970
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:15,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">question about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our psl when you look at</font>

971
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,640
our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl and it's still sort of very</font>

972
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:20,130
mechanism-based right and I'm guess I'm

973
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:21,960
sort of advocating you know independent

974
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:23,730
of the mechanism if we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a way</font>

975
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,470
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you could actually say</font>

976
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:27,510
what you meant to have happen in a way

977
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,370
that's actually simpler than<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know I</font>

978
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,380
want to prepend this thing out 10 times

979
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:32,970
or you know I want to assign this

980
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,080
community that's not actually what you

981
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:35,759
want to do that's just sort of

982
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,950
describing how you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it done</font>

983
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,830
yes well okay I'm good at some work off

984
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,660
that dummy but look wait that's it let's

985
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:44,299
let's do the second one offline sorry

986
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,420
but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are running late yeah thanks</font>

987
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,420
thank you
