7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:28,198
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> better so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quite a large</font>

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,079
peering anyway I've been prompted to get

11
00:00:32,488 --> 00:00:36,209
this talk because of a disturbing

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,530
direction that I see happening with

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:42,660
regard to gbx directions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the industry</font>

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,350
basically we're going to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick</font>

overview of the G Bix<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what the good things are about depicts</font>

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,870
the vendors directions talk about the

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,870
problems and and talk about the

19
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,328
solutions so we're going to do do the

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:01:01,559
first part quite quickly so strap on

some of you remember the court adapters

00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,159
it's like that only on a smaller scale

26

did my research<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was surprised to find</font>

there is also a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other names</font>

that they're called some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> call</font>

the standards group that developed the G

00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,489
become<font color="#E5E5E5"> too evolved to refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the small</font>

60
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:47,190
basically the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> G Beck as the sfp the</font>

61
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,690
puggle version with pins on it so that

62
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">the vendors can solder them to their</font>

63
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,940
cards and make a fixed card some people

69
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,680
a misnomer now as well because there's

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">something new coming out called the xfp</font>

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:24,640
that's all I'm going to say about the

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so when you look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the literature</font>

78
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,520
year you're not confused so as far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

79
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,859
terminology goes just to be consistent I

80
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,790
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> always refer to the smaller version</font>

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> g beck the sfp or SF PG bit by</font>

original larger version or and it will

85
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:49,150
be clear by context it'll refer to all g

86
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,220
big generically that is where size

87
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,380
doesn't matter which is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> women</font>

90
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">well that just slid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right into there</font>

91
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,799
didn't it maybe I<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have mentioned</font>

92
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,350
it was something Kathy knew for a long

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:12,220
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but anyway she</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me so</font>

94
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:13,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll be nice to her gee Peck types they</font>

96
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,680
just quickly go through them so that

97
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,738
you're not confused when when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see</font>

98
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,690
them in literature there's the sx LX<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

99
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,010
LX 70 those are kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original gbx</font>

100
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,600
that came out basically the difference

101
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,210
between

102
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,560
is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> distance they go and that comes</font>

103
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:30,630
to one of the advantage of G<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vic's I</font>

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,040
mean if you need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the distance</font>

105
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't need to throw away the card</font>

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,640
you just unplug the<font color="#E5E5E5"> G bit plugging up a</font>

107
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,550
new one that goes a greater distance and

108
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:41,010
you get that the distinction is starting

109
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,530
to blur a bit because it because there

110
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,820
are new or smarter G<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vic's that can do</font>

112
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">kilometres now so it's kind of a cross</font>

113
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,470
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two and again that's the</font>

114
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,590
advantage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can take advantage</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

115
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,160
these newer G pics as they come out and

116
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:59,039
keep your card there's a copper version

117
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,830
of the g<font color="#CCCCCC"> Beck which actually came out</font>

00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,270
which has kind of compiled it all

140
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,460
together and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good place to</font>

141
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:00,539
go to to as a hopping point to the

142
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:03,630
others so SX and LX I Tripoli the other

143
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,730
all other gbx including sfp are covered

144
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:08,040
under MSA or multi-source agreement

145
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:10,050
standards and then the ethernet part of

146
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:12,270
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again as the 802</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x standards and</font>

00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,590
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this defect standardization</font>

149
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,289
has created an ish manufacturing market

150
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,390
and from what we can see for all

151
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:23,040
equipment we use there<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to be just a</font>

152
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:26,599
very small<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of vendors that</font>

153
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,660
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> produce gbx for thee or the</font>

154
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,020
larger equipment

155
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,600
vendors or OEMs it's a bit of an

156
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:38,109
incestuous market you'll find out there

157
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,050
I know there's other jeep gb OEM

158
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,460
companies out there but some of them if

159
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,690
you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> them closely you'll find</font>

160
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that some of the product lines are</font>

161
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,020
actually remarketing some of some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">gb companies OEMs will produce one thing</font>

164
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,430
that you may not be aware of is that

165
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,830
none of the large larger network

166
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,900
equipment manufacturer vendors actually

167
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,440
make their own<font color="#CCCCCC"> G bags and that includes</font>

168
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:07,510
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Cisco extreme and juniper</font>

169
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,460
they merely get the g<font color="#CCCCCC"> VIX from someone</font>

170
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:13,480
else who can they can do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

171
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,250
cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> and remarkable so the good news</font>

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:19,090
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> g bix we've covered off some of</font>

173
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:21,580
those again you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> g back to go</font>

174
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:26,130
different distances or just change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> g</font>

175
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,130
back to to use different technologies

176
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:32,830
not only can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you keep the Carden replace</font>

177
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,900
2g back but as the vendor comes out with

178
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:38,590
new cards you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually keep the g</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">beck and just replace the cards also</font>

180
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,549
there's minimize downtime during changes

181
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,050
they're designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be hot swappable you</font>

can pull out a G<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beck and you don't take</font>

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,430
engineering involved with with doing

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">something as a squeegee</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bix lot faster</font>

188
00:07:54,430 --> 00:08:01,630
than doing the entire card so you can

189
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:04,300
bring<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to market a lot faster also</font>

190
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:05,530
they have a page of pocket cost

191
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,640
structure<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you don't need to buy</font>

everything up front if you're not sure

193
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,080
what you're going to need short range or

194
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:13,450
long range or cwm or dwm you just buy it

195
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,729
as as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can save a lot of cost</font>

00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:18,909
increase the right reliability there's a

00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:23,220
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem you only have to</font>

199
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,919
recall a g-pack not the entire line card

200
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,740
also better availability there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

202
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:34,390
market demand increases and technology

203
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:37,079
demand increases are likely to have

204
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:37,080
supply there

205
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,750
there's also a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sparing and</font>

206
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,189
support advantages basically in reducing

multiple sources mean quickly

replacements and also some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I</font>

215
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,300
it really makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot easier that they</font>

can just pick one g<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bag and use it not have to</font>

218
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:11,060
worry about it the big advantage that

219
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:12,980
most people consider is the reduced<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

220
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:16,459
this standardization allows for mass

221
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,260
production the mass production means

222
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,330
lower costs and hopefully the lower

223
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">costs for vendors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean lower costs for</font>

224
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:25,670
you I realize they may not always pass

225
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,250
that on more competition also<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

226
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,660
lower<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs so because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment vendors</font>

227
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:33,740
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the only source anymore</font>

228
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:36,020
so what about the cost this is a this is

229
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,450
a table of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relative cost comparison</font>

230
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,460
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of G bags what I've</font>

231
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">done is taken a number of vendors and</font>

232
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:45,410
taking the average lowest price that we

233
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,110
can we can get the viebeck from them and

234
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,420
then also done that for a third party

235
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,430
vendors and found out what the lowest

236
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,459
cost<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them and took the</font>

237
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,890

energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> VIX relative that the important</font>

240
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:04,849
thing though in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> table is to look at</font>

241
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> percentage cost savings as you can</font>

242
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:11,450
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's anywhere from sixty to</font>

243
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:13,130
seventy five percent reduction in costs

244
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,170
by going that way and how much you save

245
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,630
depends on how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> gb to use for our</font>

246
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:20,390
company that involves many million

247
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,680
dollars of savings per year<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

248
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:26,030
know at the bottom that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

249
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:28,459
cost for the vendors gbx that's because

250
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,770
at the time I did this they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix a</font>

251
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,690
price for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those yet but we're able to to</font>

252
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:35,120
get that technology directly from third

253
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:38,390
parties or from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the OEMs</font>

254
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,830
themselves and so we had a greater

255
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,800
greater lead time and Khadijah

256
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:44,510
technology to our advantage earlier so

257
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,579
with all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these this good news there must</font>

258
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,250
be some bad news and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is no</font>

259
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:50,780
exception the bad news in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the G fixed</font>

266
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:06,350
thing it's like light guns they aren't

267
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,000
necessarily a bad thing but the bad

268
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,400
thing is what you do with them and the

269
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,170
bad thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this case is that vendors</font>

270
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,510
are starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the eeprom info</font>

00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,920
requiring you to use their g Vic's in

273
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">their equipment and I put question marks</font>

274
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,209
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> there because remember none of the</font>

275
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,310
equipment vendors today that are doing

276

this are actually making their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> G</font>

a few vendors the vendors that are doing

equipment vendors in our lab that we've

tested and these vendors currently don't

it works out for cisco and extreme

313
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,350
before they decide what their direction

314
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,010
will be so as you can imagine i've

315
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:08,360
talked with a law

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the top</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why they say</font>

they're doing this one of them is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,820
say that some gbx don't fit well to me

327
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,910
think they should be addressing this

328
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,130
through I Triple E or MSA standards or

329
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:43,400
they could also solve it by public

330
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:46,400
publishing a list of problem or approved

331
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,670
manufacturers or even use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eeprom</font>

332
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,870
information itself to automate it and

restrictor allow certain manufacturers

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> G vex I also suggested to to them</font>

335
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,820
that they tell the customers to push

336
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,349
harder and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can even charge</font>

337
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,170
extra for this automatic locking feature

338
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,830
the scary<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about this is that some</font>

339

of the some of the sales people actually

340
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,700
thought this might not be a bad idea you

341
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:20,449
could see the wheels turning in their

refreshingly honest yes it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough all</font>

over and despite what some<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these</font>

363
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,870
well the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is the equipment vendors</font>

364
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:21,689
and just not quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> as much quality</font>

that they make still adhere to the I

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,680

tell also tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that our customers</font>

379
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,590
wanted this well I've asked to but I

380
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,840
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been that successful getting</font>

381
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:05,850
getting an answer I've asked a number of

382
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,760
you while I've been here<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the past few</font>

383
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,470
days and I can't find out anyone who's

384
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,660
who's I found is asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this but</font>

385
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,800
during the question answer please call

386
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,630
on up you know I'd like like to hear you

387
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,240
customers also want vendor support

388
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:24,000
standards like the I Triple E NSA

389
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,700
standards and customers also want

390
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,100
options so I suggested that they if they

391
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,640
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this then perhaps</font>

392
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,530
making port disabled on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> option to</font>

393
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:38,790
allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers that that don't want</font>

394
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:40,260
it to override it another<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason we</font>

395
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,560
can't support or warranty the use of

396
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:46,020
third-party G bags well even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the Jeep</font>

397
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,359
is identical from the same OEM that the

398
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,810
manufacturer uses then I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

399
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">not and actually our lawyers agree with</font>

400
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,819
me on this one but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

401
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,760
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm certainly willing to to</font>

402
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,420
exchange the gb or swap it out if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

403
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,730
have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past five years</font>

404
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,260
we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this once and it turned</font>

405
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,760
out not to be the g<font color="#CCCCCC"> bec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because that's</font>

406
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,530
something we normally do anyway if we

407
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,629
suspect it might be in the g<font color="#CCCCCC"> beck we</font>

408
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,750
swap we swap it out so that's long

409
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:19,650
before we engage the equipment vendors

410
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,390
support infrastructure also if both<font color="#CCCCCC"> G</font>

412
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,000
standards than<font color="#E5E5E5"> again what's the problem</font>

413
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,668
so another reason is protecting industry

414
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,299
keeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ebix out of the market</font>

415
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:37,340
well that's very noble a bit misguided a

416
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:38,600
bit misguided because you have to

417
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,939
remember that the eeprom is your

418
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,529
writable some of the equipment vendors

419
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,200
told me that they have problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

420
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:48,529
unscrupulous<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeebus manufacturers</font>

421
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:51,110
actually putting their own vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

424
00:17:55,610 --> 00:18:01,100
expensive to rewrite an EEPROM than to

<font color="#E5E5E5">put a vendor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X label on it so I don't</font>

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:06,830
see how this is actually going to you

00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:08,690
know keep the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS out of the</font>

428
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,129
market I actually I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to</font>

429
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,480
create more problems in the market

430
00:18:10,129 --> 00:18:16,580
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> right right now at least you can</font>

431
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,649
tell where the Jeep it came from but if

432
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:20,178
they force these unscrupulous G bit

433
00:18:18,649 --> 00:18:23,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">manufacturers wherever they are out</font>

434
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:25,159
there to actually go to down the<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

435
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,689
of rewriting bad rewriting the G<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beck's</font>

436
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,399
then you won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to tell a good</font>

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,029
one from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad because the eeprom will</font>

438
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:34,489
look exactly the same so what has<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

439
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,960
been our experience well I can tell you

440
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we've certainly interchangeably use</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">years and we have had no problems are we</font>

443
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:45,279
just lucky well maybe I've talked to a

444
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,190
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done the same</font>

445
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:52,070
and if we're lucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're lucky as well</font>

446
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,009
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fair i must say that that the</font>

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:56,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">g</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bix that we get come from the same</font>

448

reputable manufacturers that they get

449
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:01,159
theirs from so you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

450
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,389
reason why why we have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky anyway</font>

451
00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:06,460
when you certainly have any problems

452
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:11,750
haven't had any<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems so what's next</font>

453
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:14,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">well that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really up to you if if if</font>

454
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,909
you want to do something something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

455
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,799
it I certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate you joining</font>

456
00:19:16,909 --> 00:19:20,840
joining the cause here and let the

457
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,019
vendors know because at this point they

458
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:27,590
think it's not a big enough issue that

459
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:30,529
not enough customers like it or or or

460
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:31,580
dislike it from a sharp-pointed point of

461
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:34,629
view we're certainly going to push the

462
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:36,980
vendors to make disabled port an option

463
00:19:34,629 --> 00:19:38,469
personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to see the expansion</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> G becuse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to other cards</font>

465
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:44,770
rather than limiting it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd like to c 0</font>

466
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,928
c 48 you don't use the g<font color="#E5E5E5"> beck technology</font>

467
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,539
so that you could plug in long reach and

468
00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,370
short reach or whatever you want without

469
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:54,070
having to buy those<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on the card up</font>

470
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,620
front and ideally in the future I'd

471
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,580
certainly like to see one card that may

472
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,340
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> sported a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of different</font>

473
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,639
different interface types and you could

474
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:05,199
just put in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> G BIC that you needed so</font>

475
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,400
if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact the equipment</font>

476
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,799
vendors one thing I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> warn you</font>

477
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,020
about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first approach will be</font>

478
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,210
to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make you and this problem go</font>

479
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,070
away is by reducing the G Bix<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

480
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:17,530
that's what they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us but</font>

481
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:21,370
hopefully as I shown you it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

482
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:23,710
cost issue if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to contact your</font>

483
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:25,780
equipment vendors I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a good</font>

484
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:28,360
idea remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's still early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

485
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,100
game and I think many many other ones

486
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">are still sitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the sidelines so I</font>

487
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,959
suggest you do so I'd find out what

488
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">their equipment or they're G back</font>

489
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">Direction is even for the vendors that</font>

490
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,039
are not currently disabling G of X just

491
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure they don't head that way if</font>

492
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:45,789
you're doing a major purchase you may

493
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,710
want to put multi-vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> G pick support</font>

494
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:51,580
on the purchase<font color="#E5E5E5"> and support agreements</font>

495
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:53,260
and I'd also strongly encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

496
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,590
encourage the vendors to become actively

497
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:58,559
involved and support the I Triple E NSA

498
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,809
standards that are out there for gbx now

499
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,309
so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's yet I've listed you</font>

500
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:06,789
another slide that more information<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

501
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:09,668
you'd like it but we're at the end and

502
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:11,740
certainly like your questions and any

503
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:13,960
ideas you've you've had experience

504
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:16,980
you've had with regard to this issue

505
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,980
thank you very much

506
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:29,050
go ahead Randy my name is Jim Fleming

507

<font color="#CCCCCC">up the URL for the site that explains</font>

how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hack your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> eeproms I don't have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that one would you do it well I don't</font>

511
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:45,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">know which one that is no what I'm</font>

512
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:47,470
saying is somebody should please put all

513
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:53,670
my directions how to reprogram the

514
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:56,410
eeprom so yeah actually with regards to

515
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:58,660
reprogramming them some of the vendors

516
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,920
have have told me and tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

517
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:04,180
trying to make me in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem go</font>

518
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:07,090
away given me a list of a company that

519
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,280
will actually write it for me for me but

520
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:15,310
I didn't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you talk did you</font>

521
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:19,629
talk to them about maybe the log ride in

522
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:22,629
the back yeah oh hi George Michaelson um

523
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:26,080
I i think the depth of the supply chain

524
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:28,330
for some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> G big types is actually</font>

525
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,879
a real problem and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> your slides</font>

526
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,550
kind of took a middle ground on this

527
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,720
you're saying on the one hand there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

528
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:36,399
many choices but on the other hand

529
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,020
ultimately the chipsets that lie behind

530
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,790
these are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only made by one or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

531
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,650
people and they're not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

532
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,840
prime supplier of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GV they're all</font>

534
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,100
manufacturer and the total<font color="#E5E5E5"> depth of the</font>

535
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,740
whole supply chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the parts to make</font>

536
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:52,810
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things is really not very good if</font>

537
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're if you want s xlx fine you can</font>

538
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:56,350
get these pretty well anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you need</font>

539
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,000
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> X you are probably looking at an</font>

540
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,409
extension of your time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deliver and if</font>

541
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,740
you haven't factored that in you can be

542
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:04,810
in serious trouble and that I think

543
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:06,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a real problem i guess maybe for</font>

544
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,080
a big telco when you're making the

545
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,520
thousand purchase that's no problem but

546
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,439
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> only buying one or two s and a</font>

547
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,120
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are still doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I mean</font>

548
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,860
your price table<font color="#E5E5E5"> was equalized to the</font>

549
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,199

<font color="#E5E5E5">find this is where your delay is coming</font>

the other is very well be I can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

555
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,990
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't we haven't noticed that but</font>

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,170
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can see that other people</font>

may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have but i think the supply would be</font>

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,270
better happy

562
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:45,530
thing that came to mind is that we face

563
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,419
the problem of full utilization of a an

564
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,250
apparent<font color="#CCCCCC"> slot density before in the past</font>

565
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,440
you know there were switches that were

566
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,670
old style full on Ethernet connection

567
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,960
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was pretty well understood you</font>

568
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,280
could only put half the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number in</font>

569
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,960
because it just couldn't it didn't have

570
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the power budget to drive fully</font>

571
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,160

572
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,530
faced people supplying amazingly small

573
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,110
technology wow I can get 48 in a slot

574
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:08,060
but if you try to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than 15 and</font>

575
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,280
you've drawn all the current available

576
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,990
on the back plane so i think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

577
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,879
it's great the I Triple E set a standard

578
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:16,640
for the power budget for an individual

579
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,230
sfp but they probably had to say guys

580
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,540
remember there's going to be 50 of these

581
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,400
on one<font color="#CCCCCC"> backplane and that's a real</font>

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard they're not designing</font>

588
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,420
good to see the vendors vendors do that

589
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,540
if they know they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to populate</font>

go on record that I absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

594
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,900
like the idea of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor disabling a</font>

599
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:08,210
on that issue but the yeah it's it's I

600
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,330
think it's very important that we push

601
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:13,430
the vendors on this and push not to have

quite kick that sales team out but they

way you could plug in any I to grid car

670
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,178
do you want so you could convert a cheap

card that you can buy used on the market

672

to an IQ grid high-powered something

673

just by having these little adapter

674
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,520
boxes in between I also see the

<font color="#E5E5E5">availability of that kind of hardware</font>

the way to threaten an arm to us the

well<font color="#E5E5E5"> look why are you being stupid you</font>

682
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,710
should charge us a little bit more but

683
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,590
not a lot because we'll just adapt it

684
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:31,049
this external thing so if anybody's seen

685
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,189
that kind of adapter I still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

686
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:34,260
hear about it but on the other hand

687
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:37,230
we've got several manufacturers looking

at building it be a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> adapting</font>

691
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:52,049
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really quickly the eye</font>

692
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,299
could see a huge operations problem with

693
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:56,850
this though if the big vendors don't

694
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,379
support it then you call customer

695
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:00,299
service and you've got a broken router

696
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:02,970
and they say oh well gee you have this

697
00:29:00,299 --> 00:29:04,770
thing plug to it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you</font>

698
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">can plug one of their approved ones in</font>

699
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:10,830
but does it really derail the process of

700

getting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem solved I needed all i</font>

701
