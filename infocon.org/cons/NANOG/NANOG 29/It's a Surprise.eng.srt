1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:06,299
it's happenstance it's not happenstance

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:14,250
that the four<font color="#E5E5E5"> people you see here</font>

3
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:18,320
concerned with security and we as you

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,320
have seen during the last couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font>

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:27,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't work too well yeah fix your</font>

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:30,689
background or fix<font color="#CCCCCC"> your something and so</font>

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:34,559
what we've been doing is watching the

8
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:38,250
network we haven't been attacking you if

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:45,269
we did you'd be in deep deep trouble let

10
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:47,250
me tell you the assumptions you make the

11
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,100
way you run your stuff what you're doing

12
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:54,719
on the net for a large number of people

13
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,879
here is just really unsound and you

14
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,879
heard what Rob Thomas had to say and

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:08,420
next slide please it's like shooting

16
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:12,600
fish in a barrel<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you are the fish</font>

17
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:17,100
this is the barrel<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we have watched</font>

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:22,350
the network in less aggressive ways than

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:26,130
a hacker would okay bills going to tell

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,520
you a bit about how we did it and some

21
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the results and Steve's also got some</font>

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,000
more results okay take this really

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,820
seriously this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not just the nanog net</font>

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,280
this is what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening when you're at</font>

25
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:47,570
home this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what's happening anywhere</font>

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,570
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not safe</font>

27
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks for the cheery introduction</font>

28
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:58,520
Randy what what have we been doing well

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:01,429
we've been sniffing the network

30
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,259
capturing passwords URLs email messages

31
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:07,610
some of the unencrypted IM traffic that

32
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:11,120
goes by how well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know if anyone</font>

33
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:15,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">has noticed this little piece of cisco</font>

34
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,330
equipment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> um it's it's a it looks</font>

35
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:18,620
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> any other piece of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco equipment</font>

36
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,680
that you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

37
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,240
rack so you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even notice it if</font>

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone manages to install something</font>

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,890
like this in one of your data centers

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,890
you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not obvious that this is a</font>

41
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,779
pc running freebsd<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's transparently</font>

42
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:38,779
intercepting all of the network traffic

43
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:42,080
that goes through it so how did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

44
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,970
the traffic well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a a span port on</font>

45
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,490
the catalyst that sees all the traffic

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,850
you say oh well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fair you know</font>

47
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:51,860
we're cheating monitoring the wired

48
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,350
network isn't fair because if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm using</font>

49
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">a wired network at home or even using</font>

50
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,959
the wired<font color="#E5E5E5"> network here you know it's all</font>

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,100
switched the you know switch traffic is

52
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,980
safe well no it's not um with a cheap

53
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:10,010
little unmanaged switch on most of these

54
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:11,899
you can flood their forwarding tables

55
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,179
and get them to broadcast on all ports

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,700
or very play various other tricks and

57
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,160
there are tools out there that know how

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:20,769
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the other thing is if you're</font>

59
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">sitting in one of the Easter net rose</font>

60
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,370
where's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wire that goes out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,440
side of the hub going well it's going to

62
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,360
switch what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the next</font>

63
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,130
switch well you know who what's to

64
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,860
prevent someone from inserting a hub in

65
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:35,810
between there you know do you trust the

66
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:38,120
guy who's sitting next to you to not

67
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,190
have plugged something else into the

68
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,320
network you know maybe we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

69
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,430
physical security but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one</font>

70
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,230
hundred percent and you can't

71
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,450
necessarily trust it so even when you

72
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:49,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you trust the infrastructure you</font>

73
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,530
know it's a switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network nobody can</font>

74
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:57,290
sniff it don't

75
00:03:51,530 --> 00:04:04,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Don so here's the here's the upshot we</font>

76
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:08,569
captured 128 129 website passwords on<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

77
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:14,660
50 some pot passwords 25-game passwords

78
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:22,870
some IMAP IRC ftp CBS etc etc etc all

79
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:22,870
these significant this

80
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:29,568
hard right I mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Randy is saying do</font>

81
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:31,099
you know what the significance is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we</font>

82
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:35,360
don't we didn't analyze what these

83
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:38,180
passwords are for on certainly you know

84
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,159
it's obvious that the pop and<font color="#CCCCCC"> IMAP</font>

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,960
passwords are<font color="#E5E5E5"> forgetting for reading</font>

86
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:45,169
people's email and the aim passwords are

87
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,909
for logging is you on aim so you know if

88
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:49,068
<font color="#E5E5E5">you care about your email you probably</font>

89
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:50,569
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 70 some</font>

90
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:56,000
people who got their pop password

91
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:57,560
sniffed but randy says if you have a

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,050
shell account on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the machine that has</font>

93
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,880
the pot password sniff then you know

94
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,680
it's entirely possible that you could

95
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,360
log into that the person who sniffed the

96
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,710
pop password could then use that pop

97
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,360
password for other uses the HTTP

98
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,789
passwords it's not clear some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

99
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,819
you know might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just throw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away things</font>

100
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:20,479
you know I know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always capture of</font>

101
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:22,490
their various number of passwords that

102
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,099
are relatively throw away you know it's

103
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,500
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> who cares if you get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access to this</font>

104
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:29,090
weather data for pilots that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had to</font>

105
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,650
sign up for<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they don't give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me a</font>

106
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,710
secure way of accessing well you know

107
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:35,659
you get my password<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that so what but</font>

108
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,219
some of it is probably you know

109
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:39,620
operational data looking

110
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:41,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">password-protected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mr TG pages or things</font>

111
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,520
like that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might not want</font>

112
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,680
everyone in the world knowing and then

113
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,139
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the issue of DS the</font>

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,240
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> password every where are you use an</font>

115
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:53,690
individual password if I grabbed your

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,819
password for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the flight data did I also</font>

117
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,639
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your yahoo mail password or</font>

118
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:00,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">something like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I you know the</font>

119
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,979
sheer number of passwords captured here

120
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,169
is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit scary so what else did</font>

121
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,969
we see go by in the clear well on these

122
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:10,008
numbers are a little bit old but I

123
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:13,990
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chance to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> update them</font>

124
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:16,279
after lunch on so 2341 email messages

125
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:23,509
was there anything private in any of

126
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:26,360
those probably 260 4820 web<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs so we</font>

127
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,719
know what people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been surfing too</font>

128
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,370
are any of those URLs that shouldn't

129
00:06:29,719 --> 00:06:33,979
have been published<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

130
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,290
you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in your head or you have a</font>

131
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:39,139
bookmark for but there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> no external</font>

132
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:43,280
links to well there may have been the

133
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:46,250
you know it's published now um so this

134
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,630
is a slide that I put up at not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nanak 22</font>

135
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:52,460
in May 2001 in it as an attempt to you

136
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:56,840
know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of point out that it's</font>

137
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,280
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sniff these things and that</font>

138
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">people should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more careful with</font>

139
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,809
encrypting their their sessions and

140
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:11,000
stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so on did it get any</font>

141
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:12,560
better well not really um you know

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,919
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many that I can't fit them</font>

143
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,260
all on without overlapping so if your

144
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,240
passwords up there it's not just bill

145
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:24,979
who got it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are people in this</font>

146
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,630
audience who I wouldn't trust um from

147
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:30,260
the talk the other day you'll notice

148
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:35,599
that a cisco is up<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not chained to</font>

149
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:37,219
trust me there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> several other</font>

150
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,500
passwords that are just you know

151
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">completely obvious i I didn't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

152
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,490
really mostly just cut and pasted from

153
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,590
the log to this slide and didn't look at

154
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:52,750
them I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> typed Cisco</font>

155
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:52,750
during my recent days um there are

156
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,080
password is up there that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good one</font>

157
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:03,740
um encrypted right I saw that one too so

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,010
on you know maybe these are passwords

159
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:08,840
that don't matter but you know look up

160
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:14,750
there is here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of your passwords</font>

161
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:17,229
on there and do you care um so I'm not

162
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:19,660
saying that she should feel stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

163
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:23,389
because your password was on that list

164
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:26,449
because you know my password was on that

165
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:29,389
list i just reinstalled this laptop on

166
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">saturday and when i configured my mail</font>

167
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:34,760
client i didn't click the use ssl box

168
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,229
and so i noticed this because i was

169
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,929
looking through the passwords in the

170
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,180
list and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i said hey I have a password</font>

171
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:42,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that starts with four hey that's the</font>

172
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:47,819
rest of my password that start

173
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,590
before so you know I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

174
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,190
y'all are stupid for having passwords

175
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:56,530
that I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to capture um but you</font>

176
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,450
know it's sloppy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's careless and you</font>

177
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:04,180
know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do better it's trivial to do</font>

178
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:07,210
better<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so because I just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed the</font>

179
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:11,349
formatting this looks dumb now but the

180
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:15,280
most seen passwords this DX 35 at a

181
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,990
password was seen 252 times I'm voting

182
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:21,270
this password the most likely to get

183
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:23,560
sniffed then you know they're a

184
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,020
decreasing number but you know if you

185
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,599
send your password out in the clear 252

186
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:34,000
times you're just asking for someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:37,390
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it um I don't know if you saw on the</font>

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,190
on the slide on with the with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font>

189
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of captures but there was a telnet it</font>

190
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:47,560
did look very much like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was someone</font>

191
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,740
logging<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to a router um maybe typing</font>

192
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:53,260
the typing the password wrong the first

193
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,420
time you know there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> username which</font>

194
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:59,380

change the way you do things and there

267
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,120
are reasonable ways to do them speaking

268
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:10,620
of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a question to which is</font>

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:19,170
much stuff was SSH taressa cell door

272
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,030
otherwise unreadable by you yeah um we

273
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:24,540
really tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collect that data and</font>

274
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:29,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">then on ahead of data collection failure</font>

275
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:32,270
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't really tell you um we were</font>

276
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,939
trying to do we were using this tool on

277
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:37,439
that turns out it a grits all the port

278
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:43,770
numbers that it sees and so it

279
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:47,100
aggregated 422 with port 80 so poor

280
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:49,350
choice of tools on our part<font color="#CCCCCC"> two but</font>

281
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:52,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually so though that tool did tell us</font>

282
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:54,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a lot of UDP encapsulated I</font>

283
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:56,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">seasick there's a lot of UDP to port ten</font>

284
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:58,670
thousand

285
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:03,439
that you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the only thing we</font>

286
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:05,120
could guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there's</font>

287
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,950
there is a fair amount of good news it's

288
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,580

430
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,890
anything but that didn't stop it from

saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it talkative little</font>

433
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,510
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob's talked yesterday about just</font>

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,850
what the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> were doing in</font>

436
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:43,030
found this somewhat trying to use his

440
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:53,710
that was marvelous timing the other

441
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:56,830
thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this password that struck me</font>

442
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:59,290
is clearly it's a high quality not very

443
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:02,470
guessable password<font color="#CCCCCC"> i congratulate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

444

person who created it but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

445
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't do much good to use strong</font>

446
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:10,360
passwords on unprotected networks this

447
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,969
was just on the wireless net some other

448
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,469
good ones we saw yes it's below mr. we

449
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,970
saw a password of encrypted in a

450
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:19,140
plaintext session<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

451
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:22,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">great a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> password of password on pop and</font>

452
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:27,010
a user name of super user with no

454
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:32,980
TG got something or other so lot of

455
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:34,600
stuff we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have done we didn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

456
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,730
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> inspired because at least two</font>

457
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,980
machines here we're emitting rip version

458
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,980
1 and version to query packets

459
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:51,309
so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the points that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

460
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:53,470
make is this was all passive we didn't

461
00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:57,639
act on any of the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we collected</font>

462
00:22:53,470 --> 00:23:01,289
but we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> have yeah we could have</font>

463
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:04,990
done ports<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannings and we could have</font>

464
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:07,750
done our patak's and we we could have

465
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:11,169
responded<font color="#E5E5E5"> with default routes to those</font>

466
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:13,029
rip queries and we could have<font color="#CCCCCC"> used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

467
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:14,919
passwords to see what other kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of good</font>

468
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:19,179
stuff was available in those accounts

469
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:23,220
and chained on from there and so the

470
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:26,580
point is we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed step one in a</font>

471
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:29,799
complete takeover of these networks

472
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:31,870
instead we're telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you what we did in</font>

473
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:33,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the hopes that you'll eliminate step one</font>

474
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:44,168
by the next time this group gets

475
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:46,510
together so that last bullet here on the

476
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:49,590
slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the active routing attacks</font>

477
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:51,879
is an interesting one that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

478
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:56,168
actually was two machines were running

479
00:23:51,880 --> 00:24:01,029
rip on here in the room and requesting

480
00:23:56,169 --> 00:24:05,020
routes and so you know these old

481
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:08,559
protocols are being used and if the

482
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:11,820
person also was running a VPN back to

483
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:14,080
their home and we had provided a route

484
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,289
it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> what may have flowed</font>

485
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,289
out

486
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">russ is being subtle he could have</font>

487
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:29,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">responded with a rip packet to that</font>

488
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:31,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">querier announcing default and have a</font>

489
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:37,830
good chance of sucking your entire

did the other day etc have scared you

499
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:09,300
the question of course occurs what do

500
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:12,480
you do about it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the majority of</font>

501
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:14,159
people here are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> users of some</font>

502
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,710
funny little operating system that

503
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:19,290
doesn't give you much control that comes

504
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:24,600
from near where I live in the Pacific

505
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:28,830
Northwest there for your when you type a

506
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:32,159
URL or when URL asks for your username

507
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">and password or anything that looks for</font>

HTTP s don't type it because otherwise

511
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:52,950
you're giving away or user ID and

512
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:57,120
password over an unencrypted channel do

513
00:25:52,950 --> 00:26:00,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">not pick up pop mail or send outbound</font>

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,270
mail over on encrypted channels there

515
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:06,389
are simple tools that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

516
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:09,510
your system so that you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH Tong</font>

517
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:14,130
simple free tools you can put on your

00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:18,300
laptop to have it run your inbound and

519
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:20,330
outbound mail over ssh tunnels now

520
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:27,950
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of people</font>

521
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:30,918
here are assisted by IT departments who

522
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:35,210
you didn't you can't install anything

523
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:38,980
etc I suggests telling senior management

524
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:43,370
at your company what you heard here and

525
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:48,529
tell them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are placing their</font>

526
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:52,250
company at risk and to try to get their

527
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:56,659
IT department to act in your company's

528
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:59,240
interest I'm sorry go who Sean Sean

529

535
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:28,510

539
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:39,130
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and do something then we're kind of</font>

540
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:42,340
doing our job that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

541
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:44,500
apparently to me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what you</font>

542
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:48,070
presented here did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually scare</font>

knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was happening and they were</font>

545
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,380
previously already scared about you know

546
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,030
life is getting better I'm now regularly

547
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:01,270
at meetings where I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> collect any</font>

548
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:03,550
passwords that's even meetings of non

549
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:07,000
security people so we are making<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

550
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:09,909
progress on this that thing is to get

551
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,980
the word across yes and just let people

552
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the newer tools the middle</font>

belong to us you know other people I

575
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,000
never noticed at that time because I was

576
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:10,629
tunneling all of my HTTP was going by an

577

579
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:19,950
so things are getting better but well

580
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,949
they could be a lot better

581

00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:30,449
the sweet multi Gus technologies I think

584
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,580
the right question is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people in</font>

585

the room changed the password<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

592
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:02,879
you present it is don't use passwords

593
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,929
for ssh authentication DSA keys are a

594
00:30:02,879 --> 00:30:05,928

much better bounds on that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when</font>

well sometimes yes sometimes no

626
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,149
observation i want to make to you based

industry and you're typing your

<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's a lot of really cool stuff</font>

635
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,450
out there a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really cool</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">technology i hope you have the time to</font>

637
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,070
look at it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> until you get the basics</font>

638
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:53,230
right the miscreants aren't going to

639
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:56,470
care about the way cool technology

640
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,600
because they don't have to until we

641
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:00,910
raise the bar they won't make the leap

642
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,439
now they will make the leap but every

643
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,470
time we raise the bar a little higher a

644
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:07,179
few more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them drop out that's the</font>

645
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:11,380
secret<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the trick that's how we're</font>

646
00:32:07,179 --> 00:32:14,950
going to win in the end so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

647
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,929
evangelize this a bunch of wacky guys up

648
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:20,170
here can<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this stuff but</font>

649
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:22,030
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do the best practices yourself</font>

650
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:24,970
and then evangelize them for your users

651
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:27,550
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to get any better in fact</font>

652
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,200
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot worse so</font>

653
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:33,129
remember a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of laziness</font>

654
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,870
coupled with<font color="#E5E5E5"> an entire economy that's</font>

655
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:39,670
making profit off of your easily own

656
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:41,379
devices that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bad karma take</font>

657
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:43,690
the basic steps folks we're not telling

658
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:45,220
you to do spend millions of dollars in

659
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,809
for cliff upgrade all your router's

660
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,360
we're telling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to encrypt your</font>

661
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:53,440
passwords all those simple things that

662
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've been hearing for 10 20 years so</font>

663
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,679
I'd rather not do this 10 years from now

664
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:58,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have lots of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to tell you</font>

665
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,330
Michael Dillon from radiance it would be

666
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,309
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> if in future Na Nog's when</font>

667
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:08,649
this was done there was a web server

668
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:10,570
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one could go to that would</font>

669
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,070
recognize your IP address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then give</font>

670
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,379
you a report on what was discovered

671
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,889
emanating from your IP address what bad

672
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:19,300
habits you would actually were guilty of

673
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:21,370
and the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be of</font>

674
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,740
interest would be some kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

675
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:25,830
code

676
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:27,630
exactly we all showed up Sunday evening

677
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:30,270
or Monday morning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just kind of hang</font>

678
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:32,160
yeah so it would be interesting to hear

679
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,510
a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

680
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,790
bits and pieces that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were used to put</font>

681
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:37,710
this together because I can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

682
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,899
this whole concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bad habits</font>

683
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,809
reporting tool would be useful to a lot

684
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people we could use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a as a</font>

685
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:48,360
leverage to evangelize this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

686
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:50,160
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> using driftnet it's part of package</font>

on freebsd easily available elsewhere

689
00:33:52,170 --> 00:34:01,220
i'm sure it also use i also use TCP dump

690
00:33:54,929 --> 00:34:03,600
IP filter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D sniff yeah I mean I use</font>

691
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,670
basically decent if all the tools in it

692
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,620
and a bunch of ad hoc things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hack</font>

693
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:10,679
together to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the d sniff output and</font>

694
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:13,230
turn it into a list of passwords um I

695
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,990
mean I could start sharing that kind of

696
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:18,540
ad hoc stuff but it's just walk script

697
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:21,959
how about a tool that if automatically

698
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:27,330
watches and if you disclose it black

699
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:30,449
holes your traffic right you probably

700
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:32,909
can't stop that packet but it black

701
00:34:30,449 --> 00:34:36,928
holes you now and you'll come whining to

702
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:38,429
the help desk<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people's will</font>

703
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:41,250
sit there and help all you pour windows

704
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:42,659
users clean up your mess we probably

705
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,159
have time for one more question I'm just

706
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not just these tools are</font>

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">hots hacker off-the-shelf software you</font>

708
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:53,550
know it's easily available go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there</font>

709
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,619
was a pattern about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year ago I'm Sam</font>

710
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,810
Wyler there's a pattern of a year ago

711
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,850
