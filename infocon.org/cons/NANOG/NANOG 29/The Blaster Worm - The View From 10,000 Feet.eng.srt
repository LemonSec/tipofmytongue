that's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some work that we have</font>

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:07,170
coming out of a research project of ours

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,210
at arbor networks we have a / 8 network

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,460
we used to monitor parts of the internet

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,049
for things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> DDoS backscatter and</font>

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,210
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so Casey you're pretty</font>

7
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:16,378
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that stuff goes but</font>

8
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:18,480
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have in</font>

the plaster world and it's a great segue

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,140
thank you very much and of course thank

11
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,960
you to the organizers as well for the

12
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,590
conference and the opportunity this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

work that I do with some folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Arbor</font>

14
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:31,170
they're almost at the end but it's a

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,380
great team of people who put this thing

16
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:37,230
together and and I participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,379
analysis the blaster worm you know as as

was stated just a minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago had kind of</font>

a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short timeline and this is thing that</font>

20
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,200
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of seeing more and more with</font>

21
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:49,020
words we had this advisory put out in

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,640
the middle of July which was released

23
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,289
without any exploit code but to some

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,180
nice details that people almost

25
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,640
immediately began developing exploits

26
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,680
using and about three or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> days later</font>

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,050
we saw several exploits and one of those

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decon see came from HD</font>

29

Moore and that's thought to be kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">the core exploit and back door that was</font>

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the August eleventh of course here</font>

33
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,560
and within a couple of days<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of</font>

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,420
seen variants and one of the most

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">sinister ones that we saw was the SD</font>

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,890
bought variant so blaster has this DDoS

37
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,080
attack that it had it had a trigger and

38
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,450
a predefined trigger and a predefined

39
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,649

40
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,780
stuff like that can you know arbitrary

<font color="#E5E5E5">details toolkits anytime almost any</font>

43
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,920
armies and heck just just use a worm to

44
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,290
do it right so somebody kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

45
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,920
piggybacked on that last year chooses a

island hopping<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like like NIM de</font>

48
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,189
and other worms do on occasion it<font color="#E5E5E5"> scans</font>

00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,720
for tcp port 135 which is where it's

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to commit its exploit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the</font>

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,910

60
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,799
download the child node connected

00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,850
use the universal offset that people

percent of the time uses the windows

68
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,510
2000 offset and that's interesting

69
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong one will actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">crashed the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Box causing it to reboot if</font>

it can do that if it can wants the

72
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,390
exploit it goes ahead and tries it and

73
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,100
what it simply does its kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of grief</font>

74
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,410
forces its way a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds later to</font>

75
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:49,840
see if the remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> backshell remote back</font>

76
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:52,630
to our shell is demolished on port 44 44

77
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP since a series of three commands</font>

78
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,590
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> caused the child to download the</font>

79
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,930
executable the single executable file

80
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:05,050
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parent started and begin</font>

81
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:06,730
operations so we are simply monitoring

82
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,350
this large network reflecting packets

83
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,149
and doing some distillation in real time

84
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,010
and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is we</font>

85
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,830
actually classify port scans and sweeps

86
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,640
and so we simply detect port 135 scans

87
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:20,200
against a / 24 of 255 hosts we're not

88
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,519
setting any response like we do with

89
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,070
port 80 worms so we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

90
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,660
fingerprint the worm traffic here we're

91
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,519
not going to have any active sampling so

92
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,140
one consequence of this is that we

93
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,360
cannot differentiate the variance of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

94
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,100
world and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't see any port 44</font>

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">44 traffic so we have this very</font>

96
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,750
primitive way of classifying the worm

97
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,100
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it actually seems to work quite well</font>

98
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,290
and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take the data we</font>

99
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">measure the traffic</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the unique</font>

101
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of a quick schematic of what our</font>

102

block of architecture looks like quite

00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply you know we have this box over</font>

backscatter from spoof space in our / 8

108

capture some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and with then we</font>

then that didn't show up well at all

123
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:35,500
very simply let's see here very very

124
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,930
simply it's you know it's a rapid

286
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,360
kind of it so we're still seeing a lot

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> blaster activity that more or less</font>

mirrors what we see here still circadian

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,650
we're still seeing about at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> minimum of</font>

cable modem networks a lot of broadband

298
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:06,740
a lot of consumer dial-up things like

299
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,360
that we don't see any large any large

300

<font color="#CCCCCC">it's kind of flattens out very quickly</font>

302

when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you look at the second-level domain</font>

304
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:18,649
some very simple conclusions right so we

305
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,149
had this advanced warning we knew this

306

talk about others it was way too juicy

309
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:26,569
people were just going to have to do it

310
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:28,009
and the exploit that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> used had a very</font>

nice signature great showed up quite

easily we could have very simply install

firewall rules this wasn't a core back

314

one service for example could even solve

quickly much what we're cookin I think

00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,490
we give it credit for spread it in a

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to maybe throw one thing out</font>

370
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:46,130
but just sort of by coincidence I happen

371
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:49,250
to notice that when the Microsoft tftp

372
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:51,640
client tries to download a file and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

373
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:55,730
failed it leaves a temporary file behind

374
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:59,240
which then prevents any future client

375
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:01,250
downloads so one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my theories as to</font>

376
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,050
why this spread didn't go quite as fast

377
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:05,570
as people would have expected was that

378
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,819
if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was any kind of instability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

379
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,920
congestion or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even know if the</font>

380
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:11,750
tftp server that was in the worm has<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

381
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,579
any kind of reliability mechanisms in it

382
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:17,410
but it seemed like<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was a high</font>

383
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,700
probability that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the the actual</font>

386
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,609
behavior that<font color="#E5E5E5"> makes a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of sense</font>

387
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,740
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we would have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seen in</font>

388
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,680
kind of a leveling off the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">would if it were simply that I think</font>

394
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,470
that that probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> contributed a lot to</font>

395
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,330
it you know as worms grow and increase

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:45,650
of traffic the increase congestion and

397
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:47,660
that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely cause symptoms</font>

398
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,010
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> incomplete downloads and the</font>

402
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">have prevented the worm from getting</font>

403
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,660
much further however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if that</font>

404
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,280
were only that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the thing that were</font>

405
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,930
going on we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen a leveling</font>

406
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,470
off of the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of infections per hour</font>

407
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:04,699
as opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a member of observations I</font>

should say so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> growth rate waters</font>

409
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,080
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have slowed or even stopped but we</font>

410

would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a lot of activity remain</font>

411
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:13,150
so that's probably part of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

yes yeah I am Kirk parent from Microsoft

the one quick point that's only
