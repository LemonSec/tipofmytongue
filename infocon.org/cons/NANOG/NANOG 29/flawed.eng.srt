1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:05,549
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm happy to be here this</font>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,720
morning my name is Dave Lanka I'm with

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of Wisconsin at the</font>

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,428
Madison campus and I have a an incident

5
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,678
to tell you about and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still in</font>

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,529
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of being of us engineering a</font>

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,390
solution to this so the reason I wanted

8
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,210
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in this venue is to vet this</font>

9
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,500
proposed solution with you folks so what

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,029
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to you about is I'll</font>

11
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,980
first give you an overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what this</font>

12
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:27,948
incident was and I put the URL here

13
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,900
where there's a detailed technical

14
00:00:27,949 --> 00:00:33,290
write-up of the of the incident

15
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,640
initially and where it's gone since then

16
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,079
we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the engineering flaws</font>

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,600
having to do with the products and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,070
the entire engineering process in terms

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,930
of internet Engineering not just this

20
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,100
product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i think i'm not i'm not</font>

21
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,539
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dwell on that in this</font>

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,160
presentation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you to think</font>

23
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,789
big picture about what this means for

24
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,959
all of us building an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet we'll</font>

25
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,149
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the current status</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

26
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,559
particular situation possible end games

27
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:56,850
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to propose this</font>

28
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,190
operational strategy that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

29
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,899
take and I'd like your feedback either

30
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,910
here or in the mailing list afterwards

31
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,290
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is the right way for</font>

32
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,720
us to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> because your players in this</font>

33
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,189
too before I<font color="#CCCCCC"> start this though I'm</font>

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested to see a show of hands of how</font>

35
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,259
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there have read about</font>

36
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,360
this or know what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is about okay so</font>

37
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:16,530
that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like thirty percent so</font>

38
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,490
I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here because I want the</font>

39
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,330
rest of you to know what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about</font>

40
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,439
to so from from an operator's point of

41
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,270
view this is what this is what this

42
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,908
incident looked like to me back on May

43
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,070
fourteenth of this year I saw this is a

44
00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:31,110
time series graph like from<font color="#CCCCCC"> flow scan or</font>

45
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,210
mr TG the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is on the right</font>

46
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,970
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is twelve forty eight hours of</font>

47
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,710
data this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ramp up in traffic is its</font>

48
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,810
marked whisk net this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is wizz net</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is our</font>

49
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,970
internet service provider for our campus

50
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,770
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm seeing the traffic ramp up</font>

51
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:45,420
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the normal peak of 40,000</font>

52
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,100
packets per second across<font color="#E5E5E5"> our border I</font>

53
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,439
see it ramped up over a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hours</font>

54
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">from 20,000 pack of the second up to</font>

55
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,850
about 90,000 heck it's a second to me

56
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,290
this looks like a denial of service

57
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,969
attack the only thing that was unusual

58
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:58,560
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I didn't dwell on that at</font>

59
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:00,000
the time is that it wasn't a step

60
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,479
function it just didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> straight up</font>

61
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,979
it built added what it turns out to be

62
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,560
an unusual raid for a denial of service

63
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,568
attack these red bars are showing what

64
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,209
basically how we responded operationally

65
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:13,380
to it we ended up just<font color="#E5E5E5"> blocking it we</font>

66
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:15,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">identified the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic</font>

67
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,040
being UDP traffic destined for an NTP

68
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,960
server in our computer sciences

69
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,880
department called<font color="#CCCCCC"> NT p1 dot CS that</font>

70
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,670
wasted<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Jew a popular long-standing</font>

71
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:26,070
public ntp server and the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

72
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:28,500
all coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from one UDP source port 2 3</font>

73
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,700
4 5 7 that number didn't mean anything

74
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,170
to me the time but after<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while I</font>

75
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,579
realized it's the number just after two

76
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,010
three four five<font color="#E5E5E5"> six kind of rolls off</font>

77
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fingers seems handcrafted made it</font>

78
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,269
made it look like a dost because all the

79
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,670
traffic was coming from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> source port</font>

80
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,230
so and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last bit is this is a</font>

81
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,730
least tens of thousands of source

82
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,739
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> so i looked at i looked at the</font>

83
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,989
flow records source addresses all over

84
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:50,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> place said ford sources no problem a</font>

85
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,130
locket as usual go away in a couple

86
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,590
hours i'll take the block out so what

87
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,019
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic was all destined</font>

88
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,580
for our ntp server it was using a

89
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,520
protocol that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't know before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i did</font>

90
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,140
this this this deconstruction of what

91
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,120
happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> here but there's a very</font>

92
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">intervention be called an smtp or the</font>

93
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,840
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> network time protocol like all</font>

94
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,460
other protocols was simple in their name

95
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,840
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily simple to implement</font>

96
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:18,230
correctly and I think you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

97
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:22,050
here so beware of SNMP<font color="#E5E5E5"> es smtp and now</font>

98
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,250
this protocol as well the expectation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

99
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:25,050
always that this is used most commonly

100
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,880
for instance by<font color="#CCCCCC"> windows clients you just</font>

101
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:28,680
ask like a DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> request you send one</font>

102
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,570
packet out asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the time almost</font>

103
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,830
none of ntp fields are used just saying

104
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,989
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> send the packet that's the</font>

105
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:35,310
request you get an answer back and it

106
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:37,080
has a time in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fields and you</font>

107
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,880
populate your clock on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your system with</font>

108
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,830
that it's defined by an informational

109
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,870
RFC RFC 2030 circa nineteen ninety-six

110
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,700
ntp is is specified it basically

111
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:49,800
piggybacks on ntp which is specified<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

112
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,390
RC 1305 which is a draft standard i

113
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,680
think it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's an</font>

114
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,140
informational RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that the others</font>

115

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">this point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that has to do with</font>

117
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,850
the IDF is a different thing now than it

118
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:04,140
was back when when this work was done so

119
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,970
anyway the protocols designed so that

120
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,320
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> smtp clients though all these</font>

121
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,760
millions of clients all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world can</font>

122
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">just utilize the existing wonderful</font>

123
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,690
public ntp infrastructure or any ntp

124
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,030
infrastructure so let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to our</font>

125
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,160
story as a from an operational point of

126
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,310
view one month after i put that block in

127
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was looking over all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my measurement</font>

128
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,280
statistics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found the most active</font>

129
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:25,440
measurement that we had was

130
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,419
is blocking of traffic this was more

131
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,790
active than any interface we had in the

132
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,650
statewide network with men and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what in</font>

133
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,389
so i did a time series graph here over a

134
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,299
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> days showing we're getting</font>

135
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:38,870
like 250,000 packets a second that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

136
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,190
dropping at the border<font color="#CCCCCC"> illicit here and</font>

137
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:42,480
that the red line here<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you see</font>

138
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,860
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic drop off that's where we</font>

139
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,250
requested one of our upstream service

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,870
providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genuity at the time to to</font>

141
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,220
block it upstream from us and you can

142
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,780
see that only had a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of an</font>

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,950
effect we knocked 100,000 packets a

144
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,119
second out the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing that's</font>

145
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting about this is from left to</font>

146
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,110
right it's growing slightly so it keeps

147
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">going up it's that subtle my hard to see</font>

148
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,740
from your point of view so the part<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
just skipped here heart I just skipped

150
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,710
here and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could see in the technical</font>

151
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,940
reviews Howie Howie basically

152
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">reverse-engineered what was happening</font>

153
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:10,410
here did<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of security based</font>

154
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,940
operational work contacted other sites

155
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,620
to find out what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on but what we</font>

156
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,169
traced<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back to was these are the</font>

157
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:18,540
sources of this traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's at least</font>

158
00:05:16,169 --> 00:05:19,710
four models of this entire product and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

159
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,180
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this bigger engineering</font>

160
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,400
thing think about this not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

161
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,950
netgear this is any any product like

162
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,000
this or any or all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> homogeneous</font>

163
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,169
kinds of internet hosts that we're

164
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there now these are our</font>

165
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,549
small practically disposable devices and

166
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,590
they're being deployed like crazy so

167
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,120
here's here's the models if you use

168
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new firmware out</font>

169
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,630
there we've gotten always along in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

170
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:42,120
the proposed solution to this that

171
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,550
that's out there but their boxes like

172
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,610
broadband devices they're deployed

173
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:50,729
places where a DSL large dsl

174
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:53,910
installations in<font color="#CCCCCC"> europe in in australia</font>

175
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:56,190
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Far East they're in there in the</font>

176
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">US of course as well so those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

177
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,630
pieces of equipment that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsible</font>

178
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,770
as sources of the traffic so so what

179
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:03,210
happened here what's whatever one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

180
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,039
these are this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my interpretation of</font>

181
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:06,900
what are the engineering flaws here so

182
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,659
what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they put an SMTP client</font>

183
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,460
in these boxes to fetch the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the box</font>

184
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,600
doesn't have a battery back clock that's

185
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,250
one of the reasons why it's and it's

186
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,720
very imperative that they get a time

187
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,100
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise none of their logs</font>

188
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">have any time stamps and some of the</font>

189
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:21,479
features of the product don't work

190
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,830
because it can schedule policies smtp

191
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,560
implementation has a hard coded IP

192
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,390
address in the firmware this IP address

193
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,400
this is the IP address bar ntp server

194
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:31,169
it's right<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the firmware shown in no</font>

195
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,630
user interface the user can't change it

196
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,549
any way shape or form and it's put in

197
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,400
there on the production

198
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,500
there's there's over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 700,000 pieces of</font>

199
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,159
equipment today that have this in their

200
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,230
firmware<font color="#CCCCCC"> the that's another thing is I</font>

201
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,790
what I in hindsight<font color="#CCCCCC"> I realized</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that this</font>

202
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,650
had been going on for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

203
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,180
than a<font color="#CCCCCC"> year these devices were in there</font>

204
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:51,530
and we just didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they get</font>

205
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,960
deployed because<font color="#E5E5E5"> her time server worked</font>

206
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,969
everything was everything was happy so

207
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,680
my interpretation that I tried to

208
00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:00,340
annotate this with what I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

209
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,330
wrong here it violates in my in my

210
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:04,130
estimation<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet registry IP</font>

211
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,530
allocation guidelines which suggests

212
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:07,700
that IP address early our leases so one

213
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,349
of the things i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remind everyone</font>

214
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,490
is that IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> our leases they're</font>

215
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,870
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there permanently it's</font>

216
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:13,550
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens to be that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way in</font>

217
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,140
today's internet but might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there</font>

218
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,970
tomorrow the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is these</font>

219
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,530
products are really internet products

220
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,270
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than network products those of us</font>

221
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,580
that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of years experience</font>

222
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:23,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">with gear we think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them as network</font>

223
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,859
products you're going to plant them on a

224
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,300
private network they work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a test</font>

225
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,160
bench or they work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big I internet</font>

226
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:29,930
it's on you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they be you can you can</font>

227
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,130
plug in those different places these

228
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,590
products are targeted for people that

229
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:35,210
want to be on the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so they</font>

230
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">can utilize services that are only on</font>

231
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:39,109
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet that's probably something</font>

232
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:40,190
that's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think but these products</font>

233
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,140
are out there and they're sold that way

234
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,510
the green portion here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've</font>

235
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,039
done so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far meaning the vendor the</font>

236
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,750
university or the review team that we

237
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,790
put together to to tackle this problem

238
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,230
so code changes are released<font color="#CCCCCC"> from july</font>

239
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,090
through September that no<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer hard</font>

240
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,280
code the IP but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they hard code the</font>

241
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:56,719
domain netgear<font color="#E5E5E5"> com I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font>

242
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">a piano see either but that's it that's</font>

243
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,860
a much<font color="#CCCCCC"> better situation for us anyway</font>

244
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,170
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can remotely influence their</font>

245
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,100
behavior now by changing the IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

246
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,690
to which the names point and then lastly

247
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,310
the blue is showing what I think needs

248
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,350
to happen in the future and some of what

249
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,330
we want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comment on afterwards so</font>

250
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:16,130
we need to dedicate a portion of our

251
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">network to serve to service and</font>

252
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,640
implement an operational strategy for

253
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:21,410
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because these things are</font>

254
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:23,510
intrinsically tied to one particular

255
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,420
address in one of our legacy Class B

256
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,430
networks and we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a couple</font>

257
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,530
details about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on there</font>

258
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:32,810
another engineer flaw is that the SMTP

259
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">implementation violated the MTP rules of</font>

260
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,289
engagement or netiquette for using

261
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,910
public servers they never notified us

262
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:40,579
that they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> injured they were</font>

263
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,439
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in doing this the</font>

264
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,350
specification for us and TP doesn't even

265
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,850
address how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get how you get together</font>

00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,449
updating this SMTP protocol and it has a

best current<font color="#E5E5E5"> practices section an</font>

operational strategy section suggesting

275
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:07,189
how you would go about actually making

<font color="#E5E5E5">the people networking happen the blue</font>

277
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:09,800
part here is what is what's the ntp

278
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,819
community be doing about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

279
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,620
suggestion<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have for them is to</font>

280
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:14,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">deprecate the advertisement tube IP</font>

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:19,759
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just one of my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas another part</font>

283
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,230
of the engineering flaw is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMTP</font>

284
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,600
implementation getting back to the flood

285
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,839
now pulls at one second intervals until

286
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,920
it receives a response this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

287
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:29,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">for more than a year and we never</font>

288
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,810
noticed it so if you if you just test

289
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:34,490
this once this seems to work so but in

290
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of a congestion collapse situation</font>

291
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,670
this is this is exactly the opposite of

292
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:39,339
what you wanted to do when our service

293
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">is not there it's more persistent and</font>

294
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:42,440
one of the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things in the</font>

295
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:44,420
process of going through this painful

296
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,180
exchange trying to get in<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact with</font>

297
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,889
the vendor the the irony was<font color="#CCCCCC"> not lost on</font>

298
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,388
me that they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> being the devices were</font>

299
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:51,290
being more persistent when we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

300
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,250
an answer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was being more</font>

301
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,579
persistent with their support

302
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:57,019
organization when I didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer</font>

303
00:09:54,579 --> 00:09:58,550
so what we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far is there's</font>

304
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:00,699
quote again the code changes for release

305
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,229
that use a less aggressive but<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad-hoc</font>

306
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,130
retry algorithm just people pulled up

307
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,990
numbers well maybe we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

308
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,519
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours instead we should only retry</font>

309
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,139
certain number of times so that's what

310
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,139
the current code does and that's what's

311
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:13,790
shipping today the other thing we did is

312
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:16,189
again updated the simple network time

313
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,630
protocol specification to specify other

314
00:10:16,189 --> 00:10:20,329
behaviors than this basically saying

315
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,339
don't ask more often that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was implied in</font>

316
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:24,079
ntp specifications before but unless you

317
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:25,990
poured over it you wouldn't any run ntp

318
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,370
guru it might not have been obvious and

319
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:29,930
the question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> will let your code</font>

320
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:31,699
changes in the future comply with this

321
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,888
and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a big question is</font>

322
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:35,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">because organizations like this they use</font>

323
00:10:33,889 --> 00:10:38,240
other people to design and manufacture

324
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,889
their equipment they use what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font>

325
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,759
an odm this was something<font color="#E5E5E5"> was new to me</font>

326
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:45,920
an original design manufacture and so if

327
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get a company like it could be</font>

328
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything Belkin</font>

329
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:52,589
netgear whatever they they are sort of a

330
00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:53,670
facade they they're responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

331
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:55,709
getting the name out there getting the

332
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,990
space on the store shelves but the stuff

333
00:10:55,709 --> 00:10:59,550
shipped out to in this case<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

334
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Taiwan was where the designer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was and</font>

335
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,779
stuff was manufactured in China so I

336
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:05,160
could actually reverse engineer what the

337
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:07,980
product does faster than they could get

338
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,360
answers from the developer to to find

339
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,209
out what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was intended to do in the</font>

340
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,019
first place the and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

341
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:14,729
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going on the internet</font>

342
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">or and also don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not about this</font>

343
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,370
specific vendor it's something that's

344
00:11:16,139 --> 00:11:18,600
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and you need to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of it</font>

345
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,190
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> these aren't they the</font>

346
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,440
handcrafted<font color="#CCCCCC"> gcps that we were used to</font>

347
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,000
working with years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago these are these</font>

348
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,259
are quick turn around three to four

349
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,649
month development cycles that kind of

350
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:29,880
thing another part of engineering plan

351
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,740
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is getting out to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less tangible</font>

352
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,810
part the designers and users are

353
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,339
generally unaware of the problem so when

354
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:37,258
this time thing stops working what I

355
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,459
found is no one cares about this these

356
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:39,959
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that bought these twenty or forty</font>

357
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,569
dollar boxes don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care that it knows</font>

358
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:45,180
the time so the flood keeps happening in

359
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:46,829
all these from these 700,000 sources all

360
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,469
over the world but<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one but no one</font>

361
00:11:46,829 --> 00:11:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">knows about it so my solution we'll see</font>

362
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,380
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a solution is to go on this</font>

363
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:54,508
outreach campaign to talk to small sets

364
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,709
of subsets of users network operators

365
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:57,420
administrators<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

366
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:58,888
our players and making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

367
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,880
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen again because that's the</font>

368
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:01,740
whole goal here right internet

369
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">Engineering the whole goal behind it all</font>

370
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,009
is to obviate failure that's engineering

371
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,630
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> general is about that whether it's</font>

372
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:08,279
civil engineering or whatever so let's

373
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,750
let's let's see<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can get the word</font>

374
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,579
out so that this doesn't happen again

375
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a one-off thing</font>

376
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,910
it's happened before that's the other

377
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:17,219
thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't know about this but</font>

378
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,709
this happened last year with smc year in

379
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,259
a time server in Austria Australia and

380
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:23,910
they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have as good of a success</font>

381
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,490
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> negotiations afterwards such</font>

382
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,139
that the vendor stop talking to them

383
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:29,370
after they produced a code change we

384
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:30,930
have an extended relationship now with

385
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:33,509
this vendor and I think we're building a

386
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,560
good solution here but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

387
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">always going to happen so it's really</font>

388
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,138
imperative that this doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font>

389
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:41,519
again I said I'm producing a draft I

390
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:43,050
have produced this draft that probably

391
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in yesterday so it'll be</font>

392
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,609
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon and that I called abetted</font>

393
00:12:46,019 --> 00:12:49,170
I embedding IP addresses considered

394
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:51,060
harmful so just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the one</font>

395
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,699
aspect of embedding the IP addresses in

396
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:55,649
a fixed configuration in firmware we

397
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:56,579
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we've all thought</font>

398
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,899
about that and is there

399
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:59,878
or any instance where that should be

400
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:03,089
allowed if they're not for instance RFC

401
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,619
1918 addresses so another question is

402
00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:06,779
sort of as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow-up and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

403
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:08,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">expect to get this in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this venue but how</font>

404
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,959
do I reach other participants in this

405
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,429
how do I reach the designers I don't

406
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,138
know should I be going to interrupt<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

407
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:14,549
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> well hot weird these designers</font>

408
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:16,319
go I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fly over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Taiwan</font>

409
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:17,910
and knock on doors or something but I

410
00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:19,469
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach that community and then</font>

411
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,059
the manufacturers and the vendors that

412
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,189
are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things built because</font>

413
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:24,420
they need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

414
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:26,519
there's also certification labs that

415
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,488
some of these companies hire to get

416
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:31,769
brain basically approve it for being an

417
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:33,299
enterprise-class firewall or something

418
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,199
like that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices don't fall in</font>

419
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:35,999
that category because we're meant for

420
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:37,439
residential use but theoretically it

421
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:39,239
seems to me certification lads could be

422
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:40,860
offering another service basically

423
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:43,410
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this this appears to comply</font>

424
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,939
with RFC whatever it appears to comply

425
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,988
with an i triple e standard these are

426
00:13:44,939 --> 00:13:47,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the things that get printed on the</font>

427
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:48,929
boxes when you go on the store shelves

428
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:51,059
the user doesn't care about that but

429
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,988
this but the manufacturer should so that

430
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:53,610
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

431
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:55,649
awful conversations with people like me

432
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,329
I mean if you do this if some accident

433
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,399
like this happens again I guess everyone

434
00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:00,929
else would wish probably the destination

435
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,879
of the traffic wasn't all place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

436
00:14:00,929 --> 00:14:04,559
had more<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet traffic measurement</font>

437
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,179
than you can imagine I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had all</font>

438
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,709
this they were completely instrumented

439
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,419
and I've got all the post-mortem

440
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,709
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need but how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

441
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:12,389
this how do we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to change that</font>

442
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:13,649
people pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it the RFC's are</font>

443
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:15,540
because we're really self policing right

444
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:16,860
now and if you talk to somebody outside

445
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,419
the field they say well what's like your

446
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,980
underwriters laboratories that make sure

447
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:23,189
they all this all this happens we don't

448
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:25,529
have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's sort of a thin the</font>

449
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:27,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">last of engineering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> claws and is that</font>

450
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:29,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">the communication channel to their</font>

451
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,749
engineering was ineffectual and again I

452
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:32,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is an engineering problem</font>

453
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:33,989
because the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineering it's</font>

454
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:35,839
all of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> as participants it's not just</font>

455
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:37,829
it's the manufacturers the users the

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,410
administrators<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operators we ought to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to communicate to produce as the</font>

458
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:44,459

459
00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:45,360
failure happens that communication

460
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,618

461

463
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:52,049
happened if we just do a do a deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

464
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,350
netgear and it's covered up no one knows

00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:57,449
it happened in its doesn't it's almost

466
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,009
certain going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen again so um in</font>

467
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,569
these kind of things we're just want the

468
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:02,189
deploying all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts there's a</font>

469
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:04,589
mismatch I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposing between the</font>

470
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:07,079
deployed hosts impact and those

471
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:08,550
organizations support or ability to

472
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,750
support the

473
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:11,939
the users when they're when a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

474
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,930
occurs so that's something that's new

475
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,820
that's happening in the internet a lot

476
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,989
of these low-cost hosts and you just

477
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">can't get in contact with the people</font>

478
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:22,830
responsible for deploying them the

479
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,719
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status of this right now we're</font>

480
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing our best to continue to service</font>

481
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,560
the request we put a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rate</font>

482
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,760
limits in upstream and watch the stuff

483
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,349
whatever so we're servicing the request

484
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,430
right now so the good news is from a

485
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,660
customer's perspective you're still

486
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:35,279
getting the time from us we're running a

487
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,350
good time service we still get

488
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,700
occasional spikes in traffic and this

489
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,860
has to do with if the end-to-end path

490
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,260
between any a large population<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

491
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,779
hosts and the server is cut then what

492
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,760
happens is they start<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in they</font>

493
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,350
start slowly progressing into this one

494
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,180
second retry mode and we get this

495
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">buildup in traffic like this it's not</font>

496
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,680
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like to see when I come in</font>

497
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,240
in the morning the other thing about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

498
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,069
current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status is in terms of the scope</font>

499
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,600
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's over 2,400 autonomous</font>

500
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:02,250
systems where these sources are located

501
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,079
so I'm probably not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask all you</font>

502
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:06,240
folks to temporarily block these things

503
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,219
in fact I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to do that we</font>

504
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,510
think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good solution to this to</font>

505
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,850
give you an example for instance one eh

506
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,800
soh Telecom has 76,000 and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

507
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,180
this is this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little</font>

508
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,219
skewed because other providers use

509
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,449
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> a/s numbers but that that's</font>

510
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of what it looks like so the</font>

511
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,480
largest day s has only thirteen percent

512
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,649
of these so if there's no one place<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

513
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,589
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go oh please stop it right</font>

514
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:27,839
there and then we'll be okay this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

515
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:30,779
number of clients that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we observe at our</font>

516
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,730
location over time so on the left is

517
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:34,529
June and on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rightist current current</font>

518
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:37,410
edges to this graph yesterday we brought

519
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:39,450
we've grown from 500,000 clients we're

520
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:41,250
seeing query that have this particular

521
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,540
characteristic to 700,000 on the

522
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">right-hand side so we're approaching</font>

523
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,899
what we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're manufacturing count</font>

524
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:49,020
or what the manufacturer reported that

525
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:50,880
they produced 727 at the time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

526
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,439
these bikes are their dhcp affect things

527
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,490
or their other clients that are out

528
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,890
there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know about yet that</font>

529
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,570
are also using this same source port so

530
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can actually track the deployment</font>

531
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,060
schedule here we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

532
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,560
manufacturing these things at like

533
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,810
eleven thousand a week and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's about</font>

534
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rate we see here it also shows what</font>

535
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,250
was in the supplied with the supply

536
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,720
conduit out to out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users so at</font>

537
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,369
the left side<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this graph this was</font>

538
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,400
already knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was going on here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

539
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,800
we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> already getting stop stopping to</font>

540
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,569
push more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these things into the</font>

541
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,800
supply channel but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff was all</font>

542
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:20,740
out there so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a there's a pretty</font>

543
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,329
big lag between

544
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,500
the time you make a change in the time

545
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:26,109
it's actually going to get out on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

546
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also the time that the</font>

00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,139
code<font color="#E5E5E5"> change has been out all this time I</font>

548
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:30,850
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went no one is upgrading to this</font>

549
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,260
new version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code and we're just</font>

550
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,340
saying we're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be able to get</font>

551
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,710
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> contact with them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're never going</font>

552
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,939
to change so let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

553
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:38,230
operational strategy the part that I

554
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,600
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bet with you folks and see what</font>

555
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,559
you think so should we serve these time

556
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,139
requests or should we sever our

557
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:45,639
relationship with them well<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

558
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,260
behaviors<font color="#CCCCCC"> not easily reconfigurable</font>

559
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:50,610
infects impossible to reconfigure with

560
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:52,600
the code that's they're both of us

561
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,919
uw-madison heck you believe that it's

562
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,990
not viable to try to contact the

563
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,340
customers they don't have any way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

564
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:58,900
contact them people wouldn't you know

565
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,189
who's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have to pry it out of</font>

566
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,860
their cold dead hands right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I got this</font>

567
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:05,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">for free i'm going to use this forever</font>

568
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,879
be the other part so we just we've

569
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,380
developed a multi-phase plan to address

to suppress to try to suppress the

574
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:17,980

575
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:19,150

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,969
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm doing with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> atticus know</font>

591
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:53,320
the requests come in the responses go

592
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,640
back from the nearest time service and

593
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,129
our idea is to just never let these

594
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,660
things get into their failure mode

595
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:59,950
donated I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> control the entire</font>

596
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,240
intend path but I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we</font>

597
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">always have a server that answers them</font>

598
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,309
this way the other possibility is to

599
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,750
subtract requests using the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

600
00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:10,240
here i showed the cloud in the center is

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet score uw-madison is up on</font>

602
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,059

603
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:17,559

604
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:18,910
out of our existing class be very

605
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,889
disruptive to our network by the way to

606
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:22,750
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> propagate</font>

607
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:24,640
those routes out with the intent of when

608
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,100
the requests come icmp unreachable is

609
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,650
get delivered by the first hop or the

610
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:32,760
nearest to the source bgp speaking

611
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,560
router so we think this is a viable

612
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,900
strategy in case of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> emergency</font>

00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,700
basically so we're prepping for do those

628

that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons we're we're</font>

629
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,490
leaning towards the anycast deployment

630
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:07,290
and servicing and because it's a little

631
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,250
less disruptive that way but I want to

632
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys think about this</font>

of the / 20 route or something like that

way to go because I've told the vendor I

682
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,510
want to bet this in front of this

683

before I start working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the solution</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks</font>

686
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,100
so I think the anycast if you want to

687
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:07,220
provide service to these toasters is a

688
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,689
good solution if you don't want to

689
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:10,310
provide service to the toasters an

690
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,370
alternate solution might be to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

691
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:16,879
get providers to agree to know about

692
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:19,129
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> / 32 resulting in the desired ICMP</font>

693
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,930
unreachable behavior one of my concerns

694
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:22,220
with that is it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an operator</font>

695
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,110
told me this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's tantamount to them</font>

696
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,610
hijacking our address because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to</font>

697
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,199
maintain in connectivity if we want to

698
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,399
remission that address at some point so

699
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,900
I understand it we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

700
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,970
cooperation but it's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

701

out or the your time the whole thing and

713
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other facet of it is they're willing</font>

714
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to support our organization on its</font>

715
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:06,230
network initiative so we're talking

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:08,090
six-figure amounts of money if if if it

717

comes to be I'm part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vet this</font>

get the get the line items down and

719
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,719
propose it back to them but I think

720
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,840
that's what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen nice of</font>

721
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,490
them to step<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the plate right so</font>

722
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,820
the we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask them to step</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the plate</font>

723
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:25,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">right nice of them to at least say they</font>

724
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,770
will agree i think that i don't think

725
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry if you take /</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20s</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

726
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:31,790
bed that out though internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

727
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,800
listen your / 20s but it would be nice

728
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:35,780
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give service to</font>

729
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,750
these people for various reasons it just

730
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,790
seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i missed the last part was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

731
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">said you could take this last 20 out i</font>

732
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:43,730
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you need to worry about the</font>

733
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:45,920
adjacent / 20 the internet will listen

734
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:47,960
to you it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fine but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

735
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,910
emotionally anyway it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

736
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,320
would be a nicer thing to do if you

737
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:52,520
could continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide service for</font>

738
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,040
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if netgear is going to</font>

739
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:56,930
pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the only other thing i could</font>

740
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of is if you ask people to put up</font>

741
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,770
any cat servers because people can put a

742
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,270
time server in their network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and router</font>

743
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:04,520
/ 32 but then you end up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

744
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:06,750
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> later on if you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use that</font>

745
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,879
/ 32 for something else it

746
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,490
what may be hard to extract on the flip

747
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,850
side if you have a / 16 sacrificing a /

748
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,830
32 is honestly I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would consider</font>

749
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,169
it irrelevant so you might want to kind

750
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">of contact like if you see thirteen</font>

751
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,870
percent of them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> deutsche telekom</font>

752
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,080
maybe have<font color="#E5E5E5"> deutsche telekom put a second</font>

753
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:27,870
IP on their existing ntp server and

754
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,850
statically router / 32 to it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

755
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay i wanna make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it clear that i meant</font>

756
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,520
first up we're not authorizing anyone to

757
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,740
do that no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much you want to</font>

758
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,660
help but<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so will consider that and</font>

759
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,070
if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get really big populations of them</font>

760
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:40,070
you might consider deploying to do them
