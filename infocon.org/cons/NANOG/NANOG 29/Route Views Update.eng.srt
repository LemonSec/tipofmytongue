<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so it's been quite some time</font>

2
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:09,420
since I guess it would have been Dave

Meyer who last spoke about Rob Hughes 22

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:18,029
nanog so we figured that an update was

00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:24,479
in better we figured at an update was in

some of the issues that have a have come

00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:11,780
review started around 1995 started by

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:14,639
Dave Meyer its original<font color="#CCCCCC"> purpose was to</font>

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:19,250
give operators<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opportunity to see</font>

20
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:24,390

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,680
having to call the NOC of your provider

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:37,110
or or your friend down the street or

debugging on your own without any help

28
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:47,158
and many see this is sort of redundant

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the looking glasses that</font>

31
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:59,840
but at the time they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did not exist and</font>

32
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:03,470
we started off<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a view from that was</font>

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,070
provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> by Randy bush well first from</font>

from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> west and and then from a yeast</font>

35
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:15,560
and so on and others started to

36
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:17,540
contribute which well makes it a whole

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,360
lot more usable if you can see your view

38
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,079
from multiple different providers today

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,290

greatly from just the operators

community to folks doing research folks

51
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:11,600
doing reports such as the site or report

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:16,190
and later on to folks actually doing

research on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the behavior bgp and issues</font>

later stance where do you

62
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:51,989
notes thank you on a repeated that

63
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:51,990
nobody heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that national again</font>

research<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right applied research all</font>

66
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:11,480
right good enough so what we have is is

67
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:16,450
the CLI access again by a telnet on the

68
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:20,418
cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's taking approximately</font>

69
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:23,690
5,000 connections a day it it does vary

70
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:26,719
and when there are significant events

71
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,340
such as the release of these worms that

72
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,220
have occurred in the past couple of

73
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,710
months that jump significantly so

74
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:37,970
obviously operators are making use of it

75
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:39,770
as a debugging tool and since<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in</font>

77
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:46,070
folks doing research I think this began

78
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:48,140
around 97 or so and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> first the end</font>

79
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:53,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">lanar folks that started collecting it</font>

80
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:56,229
and and that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that data was also at</font>

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:03,710
transferred by the PCH folks to their

83
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:09,470
own archive box but they were collecting

88

which everybody knows is as a pain to do

89
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:28,849
screen scraping so we have zebra

90
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:32,450
collectors and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped this the MRT</font>

91
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,630
binary files we collect ribs on a

00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:38,590
regular basis every two hours and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">services including a beacon and all this</font>

97
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:54,320
does is advertised wait an hour and

cycle which

100
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,049
the research folk are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to follow</font>

101
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,690
timing for example or how such events

102
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,150
ripple through through the internet so

103
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,580
at a remote collection point you might

104
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to determine that well you know</font>

105
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,508
it took 10 minutes for example as

106
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:21,190
opposed to 30 seconds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually</font>

107
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:24,870
propagate that event we have a

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last slide there where I</font>

was wanting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get on some sense of the</font>

194
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,220
folks in this room about it two things

195
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:31,960
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that the data collection aspect</font>

196
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,130
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph use project has become kind</font>

197
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">of much more important even for</font>

198
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,990
operational purposes because a lot a lot

199
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the operators are actually analyzing</font>

200
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:42,160
that data themselves now so there's a

201
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:43,569
research component to having that data

202
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,160
around but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's also an operational</font>

203
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,540
component which is simple yet another

204
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,510
thing I didn't expect to have happened

205
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,579
but on my question really for the group

206
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:53,680
of people would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to comment on that</font>

207
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:55,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">is whether or not it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful to</font>

208
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,829
try to do some kind of coordination

209
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,069
effort over all these sources of data

210
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are starting to be on house in</font>

211
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,990
various different places seems to me

212
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,450
that we could do a better job of not

213
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,630
only collecting it for archival storage

214
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:14,410
because it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to become we be</font>

215
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,939
becoming more valuable with age at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least</font>

216
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,270
some of it depending on the events of

217
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:22,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">the day and then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just becoming</font>

218
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,370
quite a bit of data so if anybody has

219
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,350
any thoughts about that one please

220
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:29,260
contact us the other thing I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

221
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:30,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask folks is there are a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

222
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:34,740
listeners out there but they're mostly

223
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:37,720
based on either Cisco's or whatever

224
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Juniper's or whatever they are but the</font>

225
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,080
collection aspect of this really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

226
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,640
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that overhead or that heavy weight</font>

227
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,520
and what we were thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is</font>

228
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,069
building sort of a standardized listener

229
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that output this data in a standardized</font>

230
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:51,460
format so we could compare it around and

231
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,840
that's another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing i'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to get</font>

232
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,580
people to comment on if they have any

233
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,580
thoughts about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

234
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,920
Randy bouchage it's really nice to hear

235
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,080
that something's getting better with age

236
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:11,520
day um I use it both both as a

237
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:13,680
researcher and operationally I'm not

238
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:19,110
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that interested in compatibility</font>

239
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,089
between the different ones um we take

240
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,670
the data we process the data into<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

241
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:27,810
own formats we archive it in our own

242
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:35,599
formats we analyze it with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our own tools</font>

243
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:38,040
etc but we may be more sophisticated you

244
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,290
just go slip the data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it</font>

245
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:46,819
everyone I'm my concerns are far more

246
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:52,349
with the accuracy of the data collection

247
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:55,560
then the presentation and I'm

248
00:13:52,350 --> 00:14:00,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically concerned with I really</font>

249
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:04,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't like egb</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop because that</font>

250
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:07,199
relies on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP stack of the</font>

251
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:11,520
collecting device and the delicacy of

252
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:14,310
TCP connections over long distances so

253
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:18,620
you get reports like the notorious one

254
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:20,939
Code Red by supposing researchers were

255
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,810
fifteen percent of the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

256
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:27,330
demonstrated was actually useful so on

257
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:31,439
and so forth so getting the collectors

258
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:36,230
at the peering points getting hard

259

00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:49,650
what from<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers see getting the data</font>

263
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,689
marked would be just wonderful in other

words you're peering connection with

266
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:00,420
it had a community telling you either

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be just delicious really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would so</font>

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,149
in Europe someplace links for example

288
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,880
this would help us along this road

289
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:17,160
greatly to get the data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the folks</font>

290
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,800
like Randy actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to do</font>

291
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,560
their research and that includes if they

292
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:26,490
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the information please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

293
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,768
them it's in your best interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

294
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,089
we're running really late so woody and

295
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:35,399
then we're going to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

296
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:38,699
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously being a proponent of all</font>

297
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,550
this I do it I just encourage people to

298
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:44,310
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how necessary it is to have</font>

299
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:46,769
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third or fourth one of these packs and</font>

300
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,209
a third or fourth one of these at links

301
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:51,690
as opposed to putting them into

302
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:53,729
exchanges that aren't yet covered so I

303
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:56,040
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think about that when</font>

304
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,649
deploying these sorts of things rather

305
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,779
than just saying oh where do I most want

306
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a box because it's the same</font>

307
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:05,910
place that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone else most wants to</font>

308
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,530
have a box it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that though but</font>

309
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,000
I'm you might want to cover some of

310
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,889
these smaller naps but there are a

311
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,750
particular naps that are of greater

312
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,669
interest shall we say because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

313
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,709
people that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> there right but the</font>

314
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:19,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing is those who already had two or</font>

315
00:17:16,709 --> 00:17:22,650
three boxes doing exactly this for years

316
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:25,229
at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point right so having a third or</font>

317
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:26,909
fourth one in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same location that now</font>

318
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,280
has to be supported by the exchange

319
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:31,260
operator as to you know get everybody

320
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,990
appearing with it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> over again he</font>

321
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:36,030
isn't adding any value whereas like Hong

322
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:38,820
Kong right there isn't one in Hong Kong

323
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:40,950
right now there never has been that

324
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:42,870
needs to be covered right the exchange

325
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,640
operator is happy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one has space</font>

326
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,649
dedicated waiting for somebody to deploy

327
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">there nobody's had money to deploy there</font>

328
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:51,960
yet right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know I mean I could</font>

329
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,220
probably name a dozen other reasonable

330
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:00,000
sized ones that aren't covered what

331
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,350
Milan right none in long there are a lot

332
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,140
of other big ones that I'm sure there

333
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">are other possibilities our budget seems</font>

334
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,409
to be actually they confined as well so

335
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,110
while we try to try to accommodate the

336
00:18:10,409 --> 00:18:18,690
the places that the research folk have

337
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:20,820
actually asks us to to appear<font color="#CCCCCC"> so being I</font>

338
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,360
guess our primary customers we need to

339
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,520
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> accommodate that first I believe</font>

340
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,840
but I understand yes how is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that you</font>

341
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,690
feel that those are not already

342
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,158
accommodated by the you know the three

343
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,870
or four boxes that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> already doing</font>

344
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:35,370
exactly what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing at that</font>

345
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">location that have been for years</font>

346
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,750
they've made my question they have made

347
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,799
that choice for me might need is you

348
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,020
guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to take this</font>

349
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,168
offline because you know Dave's up next

350
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,820
and he needs some time oh I just Hank

351
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:51,230
have a quick comment while Dave setting

352
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:56,428
up yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just had gotten on ripe ncc</font>

353
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:58,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ripened CC in response to build will</font>

354
00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,630
install a router collector in Milan

355
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:04,280
shortly in fact the machine is already

356
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,280
there bc just have to switch it on

357
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,230
you
