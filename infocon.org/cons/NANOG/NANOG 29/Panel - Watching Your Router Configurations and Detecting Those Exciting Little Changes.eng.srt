1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:10,080
okay the those of us who actually deal

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,700
with routers and that should or used

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,049
once upon a time used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the majority</font>

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,198
<font color="#E5E5E5">that people who came to these meetings</font>

5
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:22,650
um have a problem these days of 300

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,050
people all banging on the world and how

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,970
you manage your routers and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,800
forth and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple meetings</font>

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:32,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have been whining about what</font>

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,059
tools are out there so the purpose of

11
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">this session is to talk about tools so</font>

12
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,559
that you know where your routers are

13
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:43,290
tonight and what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when</font>

14
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,828
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing when they've changed and</font>

15
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,940
the panelists are to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one tool</font>

16
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:55,469
known quite nicely since we have sex

17
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,320
acts as<font color="#E5E5E5"> ranted or John</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Heasley of Ralph</font>

terrapin communications contar<font color="#CCCCCC"> cadets</font>

20
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,460
and consulting firm and Danny<font color="#CCCCCC"> McPherson</font>

21
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,390
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Arbor and essentially two sets of</font>

22
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:16,470
tools rancid and something I can't

23
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,810
figure out why called tool and so first

24
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,100
we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I think Hank you're</font>

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,799
going to do the song and dance for you

26
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,830
and he's and this is a tool commonly

27
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,240
used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by some of the very large ISPs etc</font>

28
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,600
try to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out where your router is</font>

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,600
tonight

30
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:43,360
so Randy asked me to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about rancid</font>

31
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:45,790
which is a tool a tool have to be

32
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:51,940
confused with your tool but I don't want

33
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:55,570
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about your tool now that I first</font>

34
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,720
developed the core of rancid back in the

35
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:01,779
early 90s and for years and years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

36
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:06,220
years John's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been the main maintainer of</font>

37
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:11,470
it but it's a useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool and so let's</font>

38
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:13,720
go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it does in a nutshell it</font>

39
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,220
works on grabbing your configuration and

40
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,630
it grabs more than just the actual

41
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,670
router configuration it tries<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grab</font>

42
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:23,260
things about the hardware any serial

43
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,850
numbers it can grab the software that's

44
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,280
running and store it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a CVS repository</font>

45
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,310
it's written in program programming

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,840
languages that are portable and that are

47
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,420
somewhat gross if you've ever looked at

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,489
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the expect in it but but easily</font>

49
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:43,570
hackable for people who want it to do

50
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:45,970
different things it keeps all the the

51
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:49,780
information in CVS repository so you can

52
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:53,530
get history and and diffs and other

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,400
useful tools that deal with CBS and and

54
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:00,040
it it has man pages which is a bonus for

55
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:05,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">for tools with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve</font>

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,660
purposes so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a control control</font>

57
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:09,430
script that goes through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of your</font>

58
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,260
routers and the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your router's</font>

59
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,380
basically is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the router name and</font>

60
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:17,410
the vendor and and whether it's up<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

61
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,140
down and it will run through that<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

62
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:22,150
and run a whole bunch of various

63
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:23,380
commands after logging<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the router</font>

64
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,859
run a whole bunch of various commands

65
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,019
parse that output because you don't

66
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:31,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want some of the output some of</font>

67
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:36,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changes and TP clocks stuff like that</font>

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:39,880
and stores it in your CVS repository

69
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,790
nails a diff to a mailing list so

70
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,698
whomever never wants to be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that list</font>

71
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,440
or can get it you can also divide this

72
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,180
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> into groups so if you have someone</font>

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,769
working on your

74
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,659
edge routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus your core routers</font>

75
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:55,620
and divide it up different people see

76
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:58,500
the diffs useful things like that and

77
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:05,250
then check it into CVS or you where you

78
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:10,049
have your repository to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the tool</font>

79
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:13,349
working or rancid working it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> users</font>

80
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,599
autoconfig so it's pretty

81
00:04:13,349 --> 00:04:18,988
straightforward to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up you config and</font>

82
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,000
make and install<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the various</font>

83
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,849
freebsd port structures and stuff like

84
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so installing it's pretty easy and</font>

85
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:34,530
when you run into<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems there's man</font>

86
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:36,989
pages which is again useful so when you

87
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,049
install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it you get you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to track your</font>

88
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:41,759
configs which is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than what a lot of</font>

89
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:43,560
networks do out there but incredibly

90
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,210
useful you get to track hardware changes

91
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,180
if a card was pulled another one put in

92
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">it will tell you it will tell you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

93
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,060
your power supply vanishes<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

94
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,138
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful for that as well it will</font>

95
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you what software you're running</font>

96
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,470
you'll know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knock upgraded</font>

97
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:04,349
software or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

98
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,720
it is useful for not only tracking but

99
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:08,099
also recovering you have your config you

100
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,960
know what you you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it should be on</font>

101
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:12,330
the router if you need to rebuild the

102
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:18,388
router from scratch you have a copy to

103
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:20,159
put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there but the concept of rancid</font>

104
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:21,960
was born after I had a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

105
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:26,039
tools that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of did pieces of this</font>

106
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:30,289
and then I glued it together so what you

107
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:34,139
get art is more than just the config

108
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:35,940
repository you get login scripts and

109
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:38,909
other scripts that you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

110
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:42,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain your network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there was</font>

111
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:46,139
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> time when had to roll out you know</font>

112
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:48,060
access-list<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 plus routers and can do</font>

113
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,400
that no matter of seconds with tools

114
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,889
like par and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> login scripts that come</font>

115
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,500
with rancid are parallel<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyeses the</font>

116
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:59,580
process so once you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your</font>

117
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,550
rancid installed and your configs

118
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,590
there's more that you

119
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,560
can use this for it is to automate and

120
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:09,359
speed up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your operations and help</font>

121
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,360
your your engineers know what to do

122
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,620
there are also some utilities that come

123
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,469
along with rancid that people have

124
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,770
written and feel free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share and we</font>

125
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:22,630
accept other updates to this list as

126
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,180
well but there's a lookingglass included

127
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:28,260
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can easily roll out a</font>

128
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">lookingglass on your network if you wish</font>

129
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,289
there are examples of how to reuse some

130
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,140
of the scripts that you they come with

131
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:37,480
it like the login scripts and and do

132
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,539
little pieces of expect to load config

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:43,030
bits and and stuff like that and and

134
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:47,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's really a stepping stone to more</font>

135
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:58,049
automation so we love automation so

136
00:06:47,790 --> 00:07:00,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> share so in addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to rancid</font>

137
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,170
since it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a stepping stone other</font>

138
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,670
people have written tools that use its

139
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:07,750
repositories and use some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

140
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,850
structure and our friends over at ISC

141
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,590
and Joe who's going to speak here in

142
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:16,150
particular has done a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work on</font>

143
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:20,109
tools that will build topology maps for

144
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:23,109
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and generate DNS files and</font>

the corresponding router have the same

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:36,610
setup stuff like that so you know we

150
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:42,280
encourage that kind of work we<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:45,670
share it and Joe's done a good job you

<font color="#E5E5E5">woman one more oh there we go thank you</font>

166
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so it's much like rancid we weren't</font>

167
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,000
aware of rancid at the time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

168
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">needed a tool to do some some automated</font>

stuff on the network config diffs

monitor some things without a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

171
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:27,480
know really pretty graphical interfaces

172
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,040
just do some basic stuff on the network

173
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,900
so it's a it's written in perl it's got

174
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:37,410
modules for different logins like for

175
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:40,530
you know for iOS vs gene ons versus you

a pretty extensible from that front you

178
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,150
just write a new login<font color="#E5E5E5"> module an</font>

191
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:15,089

without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of manual intervention so</font>

201
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,520
that's that's kind of the problem that

202
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,880
it's all force one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problems</font>

203
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,819
ourselves so ok so there's basic CLI

204
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,140
interaction one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

205
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,640
survivor and I still do actually went

206
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,410
along the routers is everything I do in

207
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,640
the router has recorded to a log file

208
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,319
somewhere that way when something

209
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,610
crashes and they say what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you save</font>

210
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,560
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the output you always have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

211
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,940
and so you could use this to do that I

212
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> other scripts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that for me at</font>

213
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">the time but this could provide that</font>

214
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,400
functionality if you wanted to just

215
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,959
execute a command on a router you could

216
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,550
you know see a line base or you know

217
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,950
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a shell so you know tool will</font>

218
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,290
execute this command on that

219
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:05,930
ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it would do it for you so it's</font>

220
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,790
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy different configs was really</font>

221
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,750
important we were in<font color="#E5E5E5"> arc I was in the</font>

222
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:10,939
architecture group and we had

223
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:12,080
engineering and in operations and

224
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,610
operations engineering there were a lot

225
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,440
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people touching routers especially in</font>

226
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,540
a network that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> being built new and</font>

227
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,730
we needed tools to operate

228
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,079
operationalize that for us and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

229
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,250
get a grip on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was being changed in</font>

230
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,480
the network and what was wrong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font>

231
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:25,370
was right and what's what's what's

232
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,780
meanest sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it would</font>

233
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,830
provide that capability the config

234
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,290
distant that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was probably the most</font>

235
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,210
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> function some of the other basic</font>

236
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,280
stuff or like cpu monitor uptime honor

237
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,930
so if a router rebooted or<font color="#CCCCCC"> cpu is a but</font>

238
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of above a threshold that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to</font>

239
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,469
look at or some certain aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

240
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,520
cpu was above a threshold that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted</font>

241
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,650
to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could do that and get</font>

242
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,740
alerts based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so and then the</font>

243
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,850
mass config function is just basically

244
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,950
based on a regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> expression of the</font>

245
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:51,500
routers it could be like you know 7507<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

246
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,060
or you know RM tens or you know Gino s

247
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,760
whatever regular expression you wanted

248
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,959
from your host list you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> define</font>

249
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,290
some command to execute on all those

250
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,790
routers or some function to perform so

251
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so several tasks this is a</font>

252
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:05,390
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the interface that's it's not</font>

253
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,010
real I mean it's you know it's not real

254
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,720
pretty it's just useful and pretty

255
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,400
efficient we haven't spent a lot of time

256
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,350
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> product izing it because we</font>

257
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,510
don't care that<font color="#CCCCCC"> much about it rancid out</font>

258
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,520
there and it's useful and there's not a

259
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:18,230
lot to it so if you know if you see it

260
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,110
as useful feel free to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you</font>

261
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,850
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine too so but anyway</font>

262
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:26,000
here's a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the CLI like you</font>

263
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:28,550
know say told askim and show version and

264
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,050
and you can specify a set of routers you

265
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:32,750
want to run it on that sort of thing so

266
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,130
and you know tftp configs tftp you know

267
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,720
you could upgrade specify different

268
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:37,250
server names tell it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> download thing</font>

269
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,990
he's tell it to run a diff manually

270
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,760
which was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

271
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,320
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> did was I would grab a fresh set</font>

272
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,580
of configs before anyone started

273
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,780
maintenance on the network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

274
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,610
after the maintenance was complete I do

275
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,680
a diff and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

276
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:50,930
nothing was nothing was you know really

277
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,370
I out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whack you could execute other</font>

278
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,199
commands to like grab you know the

279
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp path entries from all the</font>

280
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,110
routers in the network and if there's

281
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,450
some huge difference when you're done

282
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that then then it's something you</font>

283
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:02,240
probably want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be aware of so just you</font>

284
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,500
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing those little things before</font>

285
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,190
you start a maintenance provides a lot

286
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of benefit after the fact so a really</font>

287
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,230
small example<font color="#E5E5E5"> host list we had you know</font>

288
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundreds and</font>

289
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,160
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rounders where I worked and you know</font>

290
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,300
I IP addresses whatever variables you

291
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,329
want to put in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> for each of the</font>

292
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,310
each of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the host names we we key off of</font>

293
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP address so you have to do a</font>

294
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,939
lot of DNS lookups and then grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

295
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">host name from the device and you know</font>

296
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,730
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to key off up from</font>

297
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,040
this front this was just a simple

298
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:29,870
example you could add you know pretty

299
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:31,310
much anything you want and then so for

300
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:33,320
your groups and you could use regular

301
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,469
expressions in this when you're when

302
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,150
you're executing commands so config div

303
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,230
and config hash or actually I'll just

304
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,040
jump on to the next it's pretty

305
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:44,600
intuitive this is a really simple one

306
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most useful well you know with this</font>

307
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,680
one for example when we started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

308
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,140
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff stuff in our network and</font>

309
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,640
we need a DCF turn on on the GSR or

310
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:55,340
something was a figure I'd or forwarding

311
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,750
packets whatever it was then if routers

312
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,920
were deployed in the South got disabled

313
00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:00,380
something like that you get an email

314
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,839
message the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue is that you have</font>

315
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">to look at these things you can key off</font>

316
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,500
of key off certain things and have

317
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,180
special alerts come to you whatever I

318
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,500
tended to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at them quite a bit and</font>

319
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,870
found a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems in the network</font>

320
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,550
by just looking at config diffs the

321
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,720
other thing it does is it performs

322
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:17,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">aggregate so you can see like this</font>

323
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,590
access list<font color="#CCCCCC"> three changed on 131 devices</font>

324
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,780
in the network and those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

325
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:24,470
important changes and so something you'd

326
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:26,150
certainly want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be aware of so our cpu</font>

327
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,850
monitor is pretty into it<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

328
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:30,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">c'mon our primary CPU you know context</font>

329
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:34,220
switching and interrupt whatever it is

330
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:36,020
you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at so uptime mom a lot</font>

331
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:38,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know a lot of big networks</font>

332
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,860
that have lots of devices can't pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

333
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,939
routers quickly enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to realize or</font>

334
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,680
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> pulling for the right thing</font>

335
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,750
and if you have routers crash on a

336
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,520
regular basis for for some bug or some

337
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,980
kind of memory leak or whatever problem

338
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,750
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> then then you can use this</font>

339
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,400
entail<font color="#CCCCCC"> weight and router rebooted here</font>

340
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,500
let's go check it out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> uptime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> online</font>

341
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,240
actually do a show tech-support and pull

342
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,770
all the data if you wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

343
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,780
after a round of crashes so you have it

344
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,540
immediately after the fact so that was

345
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,980
kind of useful on that front or

346
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:08,180
something else with this actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font>

347
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:10,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">to mention well you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay mass</font>

348
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,439
config all this basically does is you

349
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could have a command file in this</font>

350
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,610
case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see I ran at local leeway</font>

351
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,560
but you have a command file and you say

352
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,510
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this could be you know an</font>

353
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,160
access list it's a thousand a thousand

354
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:23,139
lines long

355
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,790
you want to push out you could define

356
00:15:23,139 --> 00:15:26,019
your host list name if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

357
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,509
specific host list you want to use for

358
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:30,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">it or define a class of devices and a</font>

359
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:31,509
debug function and basically it'll push

360
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:32,589
it out taller routers in the network you

361
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:34,930
don't the other thing that was really

362
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:37,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful actually with the with the uptime</font>

363
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,459
model CTU<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mon is it logs in we use some</font>

364
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,230
SNMP stuff as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it reports if it</font>

365
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:42,939
can't get to device and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

366
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:44,470
typically before the NOC knew something

367
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:45,819
was down we start getting email saying

368
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:47,889
hey I can't get to this then it throttle

369
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:49,628
is back and and start sending his

370
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:51,100
messages intermittently and says hey I

371
00:15:49,629 --> 00:15:53,439
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to this device so you know her</font>

372
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,139
device was unreachable so it kept a

373
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:57,399
pretty good a pretty good running list

374
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:59,439
of what routers where we to them<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

375
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,089
wasn't reach one network I actually

376
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:03,040
generated the<font color="#E5E5E5"> host list that you saw</font>

377
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:04,569
earlier off of the ISS<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the wing state</font>

378
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,360
database just grab it<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the router ID</font>

379
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:09,069
or router IP from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> from from the LSP</font>

380
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,660
packet so if you have a SPF or something

381
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:12,310
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> its generated dynamically and</font>

382
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,389
then you don't remove anything you know

383
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:15,430
with this shell script it's really

384
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:17,199
trivial to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and so</font>

385
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,508
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep your list updated with</font>

386
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,370
new additions but but you know remove

387
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:24,279
old stuff only<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're certain that</font>

388
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:27,610
you're done<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that IP address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

393

we're not attempting to displace rancid

and if you know there's lots of use in

that that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> great so just you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know folks need to automate their</font>

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,768
convicted problems in the network you

400
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:51,040
maliciously configured routers that were

injecting things in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP or other</font>

things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we picked up with this</font>

403
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:56,529
immediately for anyone who looks at the

404
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:59,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">disk and can be corrected more</font>

405
00:16:56,529 --> 00:17:00,069
efficiently more quickly so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

406
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,350
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to talk about real</font>

407
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:03,759
quickly was the router audit tool George

408
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,409
Jones is right here actually if you want

409
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,179
to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the mic for just suck and say</font>

410
00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:08,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">something about it already okayed this</font>

411
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,679
with Randy so he's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to tell you</font>

412
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:13,569
to sit<font color="#E5E5E5"> down so but a router audit tool</font>

413
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,159
is something that George<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gif</font>

414
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:16,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">security folks who are working on I'll</font>

415
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,919
just defer to him here real quickly it's

416
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:21,399
something that all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should look</font>

417
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,510
how to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at yeah so the moral of the</font>

418
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,799
story I'm finding here is that people

419
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:25,419
have problems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we sort of do</font>

420
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:26,379
parallel implementations so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

421
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:28,209
echo the sentiments that were said

422
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,830
earlier you know it right works for you

423
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:31,929
use it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Branson works for you use it</font>

424
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:34,389
tool works we use it rap rap was

425
00:17:31,929 --> 00:17:34,960
something that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> used sort of eating it</font>

426
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,510
when i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was doing web</font>

427
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,789
hosting stuff like basically started out

428
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:41,470
as a thing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> which rob thomas rob you</font>

429
00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,029
here yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> right Rob hey Rob had these</font>

430
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,710
little great great you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> router</font>

431
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,940
config guides and I took them and

432
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically create a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that you</font>

433
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,570
know did greps for the things I wanted

434
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">out of that and it sort of grew and grew</font>

435
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:55,120
and grew and now it's this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> based</font>

436
00:17:52,779 --> 00:17:57,070
it's based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> original it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was based</font>

437
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,529
on the NSA router security configuration

438
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,908
guy just a rule set and you know

439
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:03,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what it does is it checks for</font>

440
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:05,740
things gives you HTML ish reports and

441
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,140
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can group them you know</font>

442
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:10,270
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want currently does ios-only</font>

443
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,870
we've got the work in progress to do

444
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:16,480
pics on juniper as well so and there's

445
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:33,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">the URL again for that and I think</font>

446
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's it for me questions so how many</font>

447
00:18:33,309 --> 00:18:38,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in here actually operate you know</font>

448
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,168
operate routers run routers or response

449
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:42,370
for that now keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> your keep your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hand up</font>

450
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:46,000
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage those routers</font>

451
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,770
automatically define automatic well

452
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,299
automated some you know config divs

453
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,440
config download something where a person

454
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:52,570
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to look like you have cron</font>

455
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,299
jobs that that take care<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that for you</font>

456
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,439
I know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of folks in here</font>

457
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,370
that don't i'll probably probably said

458
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> backwards i didn't want to</font>

459
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,668
embarrass<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone so i probably saw a lot</font>

460
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,189
of hands go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> because no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

461
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:05,980
say that but I I talked a lot of a lot

462
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:07,419
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> service waters now and I see a lot of</font>

463
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,820
folks that don't have tools in place to

464
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,110
do this and my basic statement would be

465
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's there's really no excuse</font>

466
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,629
there's a lot of free stuff out there

467
00:19:12,159 --> 00:19:20,350
and it saves a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of headache if you do</font>

468
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:23,860
it before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact so um these tools how</font>

469
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:27,610
frequently do you pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reuters or talked</font>

470
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:30,070
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reuters with them look with rancid</font>

471
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:32,139
you put it in crime so it's as

472
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:34,809
frequently as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want and but I'm what</font>

473
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:38,140
I'm asking is how how frequently would

474
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:39,530
people normally use these we've been

475
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once an hour</font>

476
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,180
seeing our is being common<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the</font>

477
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,100
you know the monitoring stuff the things

478
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:48,320
are on me like the SNMP for example are

479
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,639
typically you know five minute interval

480
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,800
something that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> 52 minute or more</font>

481
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,390
depending on how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> i run takes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

482
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:55,550
and the other question<font color="#E5E5E5"> was i know some</font>

483
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:59,800
of this stuff like<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it's rat</font>

484
00:19:55,550 --> 00:20:02,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically does analysis of configs</font>

485
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:04,399
the parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these tool these tools are</font>

486
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,220
like they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of multi-headed Hydra</font>

487
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,090
so this is specifically related to the

488
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:12,650
parts of tools that analyze configs do

489
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,300
any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools do this with offline</font>

490
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:16,250
copies of configs order they all require

491
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,930
going on a live network<font color="#CCCCCC"> plugging into</font>

492
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:21,460
live routers and pulling out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the config</font>

493
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:24,980
immediately prior to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their analysis or</font>

494
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,720
testing or validation so yeah so with

495
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,490
our config-if stuff on tool you can

496
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,470
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run that because it's a</font>

497
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,790
separate process separate program you

498
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:36,610
can run it on anything you want it I

499
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:36,610
don't know about the others<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks</font>

500
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,740
okay thanks at the University of

501
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,480
Wisconsin we've gone through a similar

502
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,860
thing developed again our own tool and

503
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,149
then we're using it for about five years

504
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,580
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the interesting part about</font>

505
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:55,428
the aspect of this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> social work</font>

506
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:57,019
aspect how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the operators</font>

507
00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:58,760
behavior so that they participate in a

508
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,289
system because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Holy Grail here is</font>

509
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,789
like you can check point as people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

510
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:03,408
doing changes and they can do a mass

511
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:05,330
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> in stamp it is all one thing</font>

512
00:21:03,409 --> 00:21:07,519
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are common for programmers</font>

513
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,529
to do and what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep trying to retrofit</font>

514
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,600
this the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of programmer mentality on</font>

515
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">to operators do you have any have you</font>

516
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,250
had any success with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> other than new</font>

517
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,389
green operators or is everyone always<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

518
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,620
the system always<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to discover</font>

519
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:20,059
what people already did instead of

520
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,918
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the person to tell the</font>

521
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:23,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">wrapper tis what they're doing as it</font>

522
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,850
gets put in the repository the best

523
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:28,730
solution to that that I our success that

524
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:31,850
I've had to that is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> let the operators</font>

525
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:34,190
use the tools when they realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

526
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,330
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they don't have to when they</font>

527
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:38,149
realize they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to log in</font>

528
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:41,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves all the time and they can</font>

529
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:44,229
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> little wrappers and and get a lot</font>

530
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,399
of this done quicker and easier and have

531
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:51,230
verification that they didn't mess up

532
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:54,649
then they see a benefit to it and they

533
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:58,190
use it if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just try and you know</font>

534
00:21:54,649 --> 00:22:00,469
here's here's this tool verification

535
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,299
Jenner and generation device they tend

536
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,940
not to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but when they when they</font>

537
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:08,649
see this makes my job easier this makes

538
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,700
my life easier then then they use it and

539
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:12,979
then they start to give you more

540
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,049
feedback on what you want now I

541
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:18,260
originally wrote the tool when I was an

542
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:19,580
operator so it was easier at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point</font>

543
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,220
to roll it out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other operators</font>

544
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:23,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">because well we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were all in the team</font>

545
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:26,630
together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know hey look this</font>

546
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:28,190
makes life easier but even when I moved

547
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,309
into engineering and management other

548
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:34,190
stuff it was easy to roll out if you

549
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:38,059
showed the benefit but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

550
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:40,820
programmer mentality stuff operators the

551
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:43,158
NOC is overloaded the NOC is the doctor

552
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,139
done it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the classic problem of I'll</font>

553
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,169
lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes today don't tell me</font>

554
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:50,870
it'll save me<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years next month but</font>

555
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:53,159
this also has a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of appeal to</font>

556
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:57,258
senior management

557
00:22:53,159 --> 00:23:00,239
which is having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole bunch of people</font>

558
00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:03,599
making mistakes at keyboards all day

559
00:23:00,239 --> 00:23:07,409
every day cost the company a lot of

560
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:10,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">money okay and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask a simple question</font>

561
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:13,259
when last<font color="#CCCCCC"> months or last quarters or</font>

562
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:15,809
whatever it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco's bug was there</font>

563
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:17,669
and you had to install something on all

564
00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:21,629
your router's how many people did it

565
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:23,879
take how many hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with a company</font>

566
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:27,389
whose routers are configured

567
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:31,109
automatically it was measured minutes

568
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:33,508
for hundreds of routers and that kind of

569
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:36,359

using something quite similar to rinse

it and we have s key authentication and

601
00:24:57,889 --> 00:25:02,389
we also can do mass configurations with
