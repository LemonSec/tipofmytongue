itself until we get dns security working

dns is not safe and it's pretty easy to

spoof transaction sources or transaction

med recent bind did not speak it I

256
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,000
suppose was because I was not running

won't be truly stable unless this sort

286
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,589
of testing is done and then the software

287
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,959
is made to pass such tests until they

288
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:26,779
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the price tag and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then they say</font>

289
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:29,060
maybe we can leave that part out so

00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:31,399
while<font color="#E5E5E5"> I SC understands the importance of</font>

it and would like to undertake the work

294

<font color="#CCCCCC">you who weren't in the vide workers list</font>

at that time I'll sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">was going on what was reported and then</font>

00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:41,040
someone was starting to bring win2000 up

316
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,589
inside their enterprise and naturally

317
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,300
people love to take a new version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">software and hunt around in the menus</font>

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:49,109
and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what sort of</font>

320
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:50,849
capabilities exist that aren't the

default what could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I be turning on what</font>

should I be turning off and there's a

323
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:03,779
there's a general deprecation of winds

324
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:05,630
inside of win2000 they can speak still

325
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:09,179
speak the winds protocol which is the

00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:13,589
proprietary<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows naming system but</font>

327
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:16,230
they don't prefer it they prefer<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS the</font>

328
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,599
reason that Microsoft didn't use DNS

329
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:20,130
originally and and went with<font color="#E5E5E5"> winds was</font>

330
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,010
not simply that they like things to be

331
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,410
proprietary but rather the DNS at that

332
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,629
time had no dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> update capability</font>

333
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:30,030
they use their<font color="#CCCCCC"> naming system for</font>

334
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:33,300
resource discovery that means that when

335
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:35,700
a server comes up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a mail relay</font>

336
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:39,690
let's let's say that is capable of

337
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:41,820
sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> outbound mail from a land to</font>

338
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:44,700
somewhere that isn't on the land it goes

339
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,950
in registers itself in the naming system

340
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,020
by a well-known name something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mail</font>

341
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,720
dash relay or you know something like

342
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:54,210
that so that the clients don't have to

343
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,460
be statically configured the whole idea

<font color="#E5E5E5">here is that people administrative</font>

only<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a mixture of</font>

00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,379
that

351
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:19,040
this kind of thing starts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall apart</font>

352
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:21,920
but since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do have dns dynamic update</font>

353
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,899
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft is now using it and they</font>

354
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,620
have tried hard to abandon their

355
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:33,440
proprietary technology but they have a

356
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:36,559
security model crisis where they used

357
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,540
Kerberos but Kerberos didn't do

358
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:41,059
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> they needed to do those of</font>

359
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:43,370
you who've run<font color="#CCCCCC"> auntie systems know that</font>

360
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:45,590
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to be in various</font>

361
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,928

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:51,918
resources to various privileged groups

363
00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:53,750
and then it is sort of a set intersect

364
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,940
between the groups you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the group</font>

365
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,500
the resource needs that allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

367
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:04,400
in an empty environment they put those

368
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,049
groups at the end of the Kerberos

369
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,440
tickets that their ticket granting

370
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:11,750
servers grant but and they are any place

371
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,090
that the Kerberos standard says is

372
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:17,140
available for vendor extensions of this

373
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:22,370
kind but they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not say the format of</font>

those that extended data area area that

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,809
makes them incompatible<font color="#E5E5E5"> in subtle ways</font>

376
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:29,630
with other Kerberos key distribution

377
00:19:26,809 --> 00:19:32,990
systems or with other protocols that use

378
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:35,330
kerberos to do their authentication they

379
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,730
are using Kerberos with this extension

380
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,540
to secure their dynamic update

transactions bind by its nature cannot

complain endlessly about all of the
