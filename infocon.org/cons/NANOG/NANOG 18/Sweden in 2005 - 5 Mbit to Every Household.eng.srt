don't have ice beers but poor obvious<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

13
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:35,280
think that home now Sweden is about the

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:39,899
size of California in area but it only

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">has 99 million people and so if the</font>

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,170
government is like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of local you can</font>

17
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,820
take that you can walk down and hit the

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">ministers over their head and we were</font>

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,629
looking into what<font color="#CCCCCC"> should we do for</font>

20
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure for a country and I know</font>

21
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,129
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some concepts in here you</font>

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't do in the US but for all the</font>

23
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,949
country where the polar bears are taking

24
00:00:54,809 --> 00:01:01,260
up some of the space it may be possible

25
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:02,550
it ever is very interesting scalability

26
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,319
problems that I don't think we have

27
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,630
fought up yet that's going to get us

28
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,279
anywhere so that's I want to share with

29
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,929
you some of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have been</font>

30
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at so the background to this is</font>

31
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,080
the useful as a company this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sweden</font>

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">inc and what should we do for</font>

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure to be profitable</font>

34
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:22,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">historically government has been</font>

35
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:27,169
providing railroads and roads and<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth</font>

36
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff right and maybe we should make</font>

37
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,229
infrastructure for the future being

38
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,630
something everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knows how bad</font>

39
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,670
it becomes when the government tries to

40
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,030
deal the technical things they usually

41
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,470
 up totally so we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep the</font>

42
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">government out of that I mean because</font>

43
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">the government can't find employees that</font>

44
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,549
were smart enough to figure out tell the

45
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,299
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between a toaster and a</font>

46
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,979
rather her so let's so there's something

47
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">called the IT</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> commission in Sweden which</font>

48
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:58,350
is part of the Ministry of Trade and

49
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:01,259
Industry and they have they are looking

50
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:02,789
at what to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the this this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

51
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,030
has the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sherman and the Chairman is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,890
Minister of Industry and this guy became

53
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,560
famous because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses the government's</font>

54
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,900
credit card to go to

55
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">kit kat klub kind of thing a couple of</font>

56
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so he knows how he knows what</font>

57
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:20,690
the major application for the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

58
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:23,330
going to be so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at Sweden</font>

59
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:26,930
it's 40 50 kilometers wide okay its one

60
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:29,900
point six thousand kilometres long it's

61
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,760
about 100,000 miles long and 9 million

62
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,940
people so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives you 12 and a half</font>

63
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,040
per square kilometer and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only place</font>

64
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:41,600
that is less dense populated is Sahara

65
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,548
and at some parts of northern Canada now

66
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,100
the ID Commission has a lot of people

67
00:02:43,549 --> 00:02:47,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">sitting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing that very much so</font>

68
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,709
you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chairman on the top I'm</font>

69
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:50,120
trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a drawing here and the</font>

70
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,700
Chairman is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minister right and then</font>

71
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,170
there are people there and then there

72
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,298
are study groups and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font>

73
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:57,619
study groups that I know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

74
00:02:56,299 --> 00:03:00,260
is doing absolutely nothing that talk

75
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:03,470
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> etrade one is talking about legal</font>

76
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,060
stuff but what that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lawmakers need</font>

77
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,760
to do in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make this information</font>

78
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:09,110
stuff work and that one that the last

79
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the one that worries about the</font>

80
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:15,380
infrastructure so the study group for

81
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,640
infrastructure is trying to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

82
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:20,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell the government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what to do</font>

83
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,399
next and we give read on that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

84
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,560
have a broadband infrastructure and boba

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,359
is the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay maybe broadband</font>

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,780
translate to dedicate it access to

87
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:33,920
everybody's home that actually works at

88
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:37,040
an acceptable cost and it should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AP</font>

89
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,358
should be able to reach everybody in

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,160
order to make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work you have to</font>

91
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:42,170
identify the issues and what they need

92
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and we have to make proposals ok</font>

93
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,780
so the vision was within five years and

94
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you think five years is a long time</font>

95
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:50,299
you would figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out from the rest of my</font>

96
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,590
talk that's a lot of digging to be done

97
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:53,630
and they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough not enough</font>

98
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,290
digging machines so five years not that

99
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:59,359
a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time why do I say five megabits</font>

100
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:02,179
well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that five megabit is the</font>

101
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:04,069
bottom line useful connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

102
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,780
have because if you want to stay at home

103
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:07,760
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do your work which doesn't</font>

104
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,319
take that much bandwidth but then you

105
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,780
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch the gossips in their</font>

106
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,100
cafeteria you want you to want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

107
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,319
some games<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you want to surf the net</font>

108
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,149
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you maybe want to watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TV so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five</font>

109
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:20,358
megabit is kind of where it starts

110
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,798
become useful my ID is most to build a

111
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,000
network that can go both directions so

112
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:25,310
this is 5 megabits to

113
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,750
from the users because one key thing

114
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:28,550
here is to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make people</font>

115
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,200
capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing things from their house</font>

116
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,000
that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make business on or that</font>

117
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:36,400
we can make this is on and selves other

118
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,410
people in Germany I mean other Europeans

119
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,859
if you build something infrastructure so

120
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,380
the key is like I do I stay at home and

121
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,750
work using my electronic stuff or I go

122
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,250
to work and go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work is provide we</font>

123
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,290
have public transportation doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call</font>

124
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,760
bosses and solve a stealth sittin here

125
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,770
they have a clam<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's a Tory for</font>

126
00:04:52,760 --> 00:05:02,120
politico's you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco</font>

127
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:03,710
back again so in Sweden EU are comparing

128
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,210
the process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> transportation with the</font>

129
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:07,400
cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus pass it's about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seventy</font>

130
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:09,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars a month so this five</font>

131
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,390
megabits serve is using it for basic

132
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,320
stuff not doing anything fancy to go for

133
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:16,729
extra it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 75 dollars a month and people</font>

134
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,500
have some people you may say oh this is

135
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:22,550
not possible it actually is but you

136
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,169
can't see the PDT any longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

137
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,640
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> competition and why do</font>

138
00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:26,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to have competition well we</font>

139
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:32,240
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the latest and greatest</font>

140

<font color="#CCCCCC">networking down here so it turns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

142
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:38,060
that you need a fiber ok and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then people</font>

143
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">come to me and say hey how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about radio</font>

144
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,960
steroids and you have to explain to

145
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you shoot up a survived it has a</font>

00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,890
fixed bandwidth it comes down after five

147
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,150
years you explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people rave you</font>

148
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">look have you seen the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tower on the</font>

149
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:51,950
building over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there do you know how it</font>

150
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,090
gets there wire so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long talk do</font>

151
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,560
you explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them look if you put</font>

152
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,780
fiber in the ground 0 comments on the

153
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,080
ground it has a lifetime<font color="#CCCCCC"> of at least</font>

154
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:04,219
maybe 50 years and it becomes better

155
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,840
every year ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the fiber is not</font>

156
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:07,729
really the limiting factor what you put

157
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">an end of it as a limiting factor and</font>

158
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:13,729
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty easy to replace fiber to</font>

159
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:16,880
the house turned out to be very useless

160
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,409
because at home we put the twelve

161
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,479
thousand eight on top of the fiber patch

162
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,360
cord and after day<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a half the street</font>

163
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,430
metal hair cut it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped working</font>

164
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,110
so what you want to do is probably get

165
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,640
cat5 cable which is something you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

166
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,979
deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a household and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can put</font>

167
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,140
the cheap hub on there as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the delivery</font>

168
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:35,630
method and within hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> meters it's</font>

169
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:36,680
like the ethernet specifications 160

170
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,630
meters right this is

171
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,009
that as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can go with ethernet</font>

172
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:45,169
the quarry if you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

173
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:47,900
plex um so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 megabits</font>

174
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,130
over cat5 cable to everybody and that

175
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,780
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have to get fiber we</font>

176
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,990
didn't have a meter from everybody's

177
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,400
place where they live<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and there are</font>

178
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,080
places where<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly the people lives</font>

179
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,280
that there's no commercial company your

180
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,840
carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to even think about</font>

181
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,059
running fiber there so it's a state

182
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:07,698
problem the bottom line is the important

183
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:14,240
one communications architecture IP here

184
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:17,690
people ask ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a move okay there's</font>

185
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,150
not a dress<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an ipv4 said if you</font>

186
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,219
remembered everything and you get one

187
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:24,169
let's see here you get one quarter of

188
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,599
the address<font color="#CCCCCC"> space to China one quarter</font>

189
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> India won 14 of America and 14 to</font>

190
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:34,389
Europe there's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be there is</font>

191
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:36,740
one address for household so well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

192
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:38,300
in order to build such<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of such a</font>

193
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:40,490
network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the operators</font>

194
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,320
to figure out how to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vets</font>

195
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:43,669
to the house you can't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decision</font>

196
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,050
if your government you can't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

197
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:46,729
decision on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build an effort</font>

198
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,409
because then you only delimiter their

199
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:50,240
way so competing or their ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

200
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:51,500
building stuff so you have to say we

201
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,389
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get fiber we didn't</font>

202
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,669
how to meet its really building and you

203
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:57,050
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to get a fiber there in</font>

204
00:07:55,669 --> 00:08:00,940
such a way that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get billed</font>

205
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:04,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">stars and rings whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

206
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,780
turns out that five megabits<font color="#E5E5E5"> to three</font>

207
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,229
and a half million households it's a

208
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:10,340
hell of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of megabits and if you try</font>

209
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:12,258
to build an effort we use to build

210
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,940
networks it won't fit so we have to do

211
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,130
something more intelligent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there is</font>

212
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">also a defense issue here if you build</font>

213
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:19,550
an infrastructure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> really don't want</font>

214
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,320
it to be easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take out if you have</font>

215
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:23,120
like four backbone pair for four major

216
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,639
railroads in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. that carry most of</font>

217
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,440
the fiber it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple if some</font>

218
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:28,789
stupid people that what proposal I heard

219
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:37,370
was to put them up at the power lines

220
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:39,979
haha<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh God takes an old lady so if</font>

221
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,690
ideas have a state put the fiber<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

222
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:44,180
and I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are making a</font>

223
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,170
living out of putting fiber sorry you

224
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:47,930
can put them in for a government<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

225
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:50,209
they can give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money then you</font>

226
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,939
want a charged isp a fixed cost per ha

227
00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:54,878
so the cost for house is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

228
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:56,899
same if you're in the middle of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> city</font>

229
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:58,670
where it is about a million people

230
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:00,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">living or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're the middle of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no work</font>

231
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,929
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember it's optics it's not very</font>

232
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:04,819
not much hard to go between two

233
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:06,769
buildings in the city vs go 50

234
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:08,449
kilometres out in the forest it doesn't

235
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:11,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">really matter from what kind of stuff</font>

236
00:09:08,449 --> 00:09:12,649
you put in and the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> line I heard</font>

237
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,540
from the political<font color="#E5E5E5"> comments already</font>

238
00:09:12,649 --> 00:09:16,550
owned by the state like to the state

239
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:23,449
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if they're our own roads but I</font>

240
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:24,920
hate tell roads<font color="#CCCCCC"> tall roads uh-huh so you</font>

241
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:26,420
have to put in enough fiber so you can

242
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,399
have multiple operators to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> President</font>

243
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:30,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">in any geographical segment that means</font>

244
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,819
that we have to put in enough fiber so

245
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,619
we were looking and playing around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

246
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:35,899
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to</font>

247
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:37,309
have 40 operators in the city and it's a

248
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:42,379
hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot for the operators for</font>

249
00:09:37,309 --> 00:09:43,939
building then you have to dig this fight

250
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:46,639
with such a way to get two paths because

251
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:48,230
it's something breaks on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Friday it has</font>

252
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,459
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to be self healing and work</font>

253
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:52,610
on till monday when they can get people

254
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:55,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">out because the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service staff remembered</font>

255
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:57,470
it's like minus 10 degrees<font color="#CCCCCC"> Celsius cold</font>

256
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,970
and they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to do in this dark</font>

257
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:00,970
so you get lots of alcohol

258
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:09,130
so if you sit down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say okay let's</font>

259
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,209
figure out what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do so what do we</font>

260
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,680
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's what's the layers of</font>

261
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,810
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're all physical layers</font>

262
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">fiber cables and wires and I mean I have</font>

263
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,529
two armed all this technology stuff

264
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:20,470
together we need to have the logical

265
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:22,449
layer traffic exchanges how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get</font>

266
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:24,730
traffic from those two<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers we have</font>

267
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:26,560
to get dns time we have to get security

268
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,209
working because now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for life and</font>

269
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,189
for real we have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

270
00:10:28,209 --> 00:10:31,660
legislation working and we have to find

271
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,730
enough people or create enough people

272
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:38,199
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough clue to keep it running the</font>

273
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:41,980
last line is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very tricky now so to get</font>

274
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:45,819
closer so to the operator the government

275
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:48,519
should be dark fiber nothing on it but

276
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:49,750
not even w DM and burglar alarm lube is

277
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,790
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the government or the</font>

278
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,320
city of whoever provide the fiber has to

279
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:54,579
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to tell if it broke somebody cut</font>

280
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,220
it so they can go out it fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> it without</font>

00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:58,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">having the operators to tell them you</font>

283
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,550
can do both rings and stars you have to

284
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,060
put in enough fiber so you can have 40

285
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:09,519
operators in the city 15 in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> suburban</font>

286
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:12,310
suburban and some operators in the

287
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,600
middle of nowhere if you play around

288
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,369
with numbers you find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

292
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:25,630
apart here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trick so they give to</font>

293
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,490
operator the fiber the government give

294

the operator of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber okay what do</font>

295
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,660
we ask for in return well he has to

296
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,240
deliver a plug that the use of this

297
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:38,260
gives him ipv4 unicast and multicast and

298
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,940
ipv6 whenever it works<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and it has</font>

299
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,310
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be five megabits from anywhere for</font>

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:43,899
anywhere between Sweden and at least

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,160
seventy percent throw the five mega

302
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,529

303
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:49,120
because they're going to watch<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV or</font>

304
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,500
something and TV is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things</font>

305
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,300
where TV enrages one of those things

306
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,250
where one too many is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

307
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:57,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">can make multicast work many-to-many</font>

308
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:59,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">slightly still something tricky then if</font>

309
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:01,209
you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that minimal delay between</font>

310
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,540
subscribers in the same city should be

311
00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:06,579
to 20 milliseconds you make wonder why

312
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:07,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">does he put it there well I want to tell</font>

313
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:08,920
the difference operators that they have

314
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,939
to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to hit the connect</font>

315
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,620
because it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the</font>

316
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:13,149
government's problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> may I say it has to</font>

317
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,950
be less than 20 millisecond<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit go</font>

318
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,860
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

319
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,440
then you have a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to buy</font>

320
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,540
capacity to other countries and I don't

321
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,950
want to have to design a special system

322
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,439
where we have a nap in front of the

323
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:27,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">country or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something or a cash so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

324
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,960
have to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we make this</font>

325
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and</font>

326
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,590
one way of saying is that for every

327
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,160
household at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 bits per second</font>

328
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:38,890
should be globally global capacity that

329
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,300
rounds up to about 1.2 gigabit which we

330
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,040
already have today so it's a no brainer

331
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:44,199
but that way you don't need to do any

332
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,459
special hack the DMark to the user

333
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,660
should be ten or hundred megabit

334
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:51,130
Ethernet and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say well look the</font>

335
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,829
biggest unit that should go<font color="#E5E5E5"> away if</font>

336
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:55,920
something breaks is free to use 32

337
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,270
households<font color="#E5E5E5"> for free to customers and</font>

338
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,510
then you say well you have to make it

339
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">restore pretty fast and then starts</font>

340
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:04,510
continuities if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

341
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:06,640
translate it to english<font color="#CCCCCC"> North American</font>

342
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,170
ever said GSA they actually wrote a

343
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,430
specification or what an<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

344
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">service should be for the government</font>

345
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:18,099
agencies that actually makes some sense

346
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:20,950
so why not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it well why well if</font>

347
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,720
Sweden did this today anybody who works

348
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,400
equipment manufacturer anybody was an

349
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,770
operator could just step in and say hey

350
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,590
hey we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> also that we also want to</font>

351
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:31,090
play and the state only needs to make

352
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure that everybody has the phone</font>

353
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,090
everybody has the same connectivity

354
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,490
regardless of where they live right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

355
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,340
today they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> caring for that everybody</font>

356
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:46,480
has a film where they can call 911 or in

357
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sweden is 112 now so why don't I want</font>

358
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,430
the state to build the phone company why

359
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,410
don't I want the city-run operator<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

360
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> waiting love scene okay so but</font>

361
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,170
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really pretty good at running</font>

362
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,930
digging machine so how about doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

363
00:13:56,170 --> 00:14:01,300
the horizontal things are people digging

364
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,979
those are cities and government agencies

365
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:05,260
def digging<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're putting in the dark</font>

366
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,210
fiber the vertical bars represents the

367
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:10,060
operators and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sweden everything is</font>

368
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:12,670
called tell us something so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there tell</font>

369
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone foods 2270 here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so those</font>

370
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">are operators so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font>

371
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,290
providers are nationwide<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worldwide</font>

372
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:22,030
and the fiber provider local so if you

373
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,829
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell the government guys you say</font>

374
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:25,390
hey look you have cities and you have a

375
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">serious dig around the fiber to the next</font>

376
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,420
city<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks pretty simple then</font>

377
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:31,640
you try to explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them what they do</font>

378
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,650
inside the city they have to they have

379
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,780
to you in most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cities in Sweden are very</font>

380
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,459
small so you have to have two sites

381
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:39,620
where they can have all the fiber patch

382
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:41,420
things and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pat and provide colocation</font>

383
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,730
space those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big blue pluses in</font>

384
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,069
the middle and then you go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

385
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:48,950
way to a a is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end users writers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

386
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:53,240
houses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the green one that goes like</font>

387
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">this other nations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like grid then you</font>

388
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,660
get to the building<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

389
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,880
use the copper cable over there it's

390
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:04,459
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 years over 50 years old it's</font>

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago the nitrogen they have the pressure</font>

393
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,220
X pressurize the cable run out so it's

394
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,140
what we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> water in there so it's</font>

395
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:14,360
pretty useless so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably have to</font>

396
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">do new cabling and if you do new cabling</font>

397
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,560
why don't you just do cat5 cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> eng</font>

398
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,329
from debate for making apartments so

<font color="#CCCCCC">share to a shared space somewhere in the</font>

401
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,410
here down to a patch panel<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok there are</font>

choice of what technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put the box</font>

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like a relative but they may</font>

407
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:40,400
put a bridge or switch or whatever they

408
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,280
want and then this is the interface to

409
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,569
the state fiber and there are some geeks

410

living in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> building like those are</font>

411
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:50,780
the ones that I should have two plugs

<font color="#CCCCCC">two operators so the DMark to the user I</font>

that goes through set-top box it's

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,360
satellites take the radio out and put

418
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,780
something that can we see multicast

419
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:08,360
packets and to decode mpeg-2 stuff so I

420
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:10,400
see a new industry of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> producing</font>

421
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,220
boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do things you can walk over</font>

422
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:18,170
25 somebody's for line pbx with IP

423
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:21,290
functionality if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I were to build this</font>

424
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:23,300
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in order to make in</font>

425
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,650
order to do to say what I already said I

426
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,199
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay can I build this</font>

427
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:29,480
network and I said well maybe let's see

428
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,940
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would do so I would do like this</font>

429
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,550
i will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> builder rang use some kind</font>

430
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:36,080
of ring technology our friends at cisco

431
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:38,120
have done something called DPT that does

432
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:39,680
moments what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want so you put two core</font>

433
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,850
nose and you put a ring and this is the

434
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,349
two sides with a street but

435
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,600
have the subscriber sitting right and

436
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:48,199
for the next street over you make

437
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,759
another ring so what you do is you put

438
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:51,290
that would build like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the CD</font>

439
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,930
fibers under to the other 3d fiber

440
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:57,410
center I would build a ring like this i

441
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:59,508
would pay then i would put boxes he out

442
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,980
here that has lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intelligence very</font>

443
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:02,120
intelligent virus because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't really</font>

444
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,769
want anything in the middle of the

445
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,419
network because when i add customers i

446
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,530
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to see more packets i don't</font>

447
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:09,079
want to have more intelligence in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

448
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:11,389
center of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i started</font>

449
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to scratch my head and say hmm many</font>

450
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:19,429
megabytes another thing is that when you

451
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:21,740
d mark today we we end up putting that

452
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:23,089
boxes and all sorts of stuff in front of

453
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,679
the users and sometimes it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

454
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,510
useful like I see games that actually

455
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:29,270
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> two IP addresses stick it in the</font>

456
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:33,620
same way<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftp does sometimes you want to</font>

457
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:35,179
have the VPN like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> h1 is further in</font>

458
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:38,299
the house working<font color="#E5E5E5"> at home he wants to be</font>

461
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:44,390
h3 is the boy is the kids playing games

462
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,100
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have different requirements so the</font>

463
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:48,020
box has to be pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligent in</font>

464
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,580
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what Matt Gabe is to</font>

465
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:51,500
do net for what mac address to

466
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,649
encapsulate and send it over to the VPN

467
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,539
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> flores company so i think we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

468
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:58,460
put we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are think we are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to work</font>

469
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:00,650
situation where the edge<font color="#E5E5E5"> talks has to be</font>

470
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,169
much more intelligent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you say</font>

471
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:04,460
it's too expensive but hey figure out

472
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:08,539
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those boxes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be in</font>

473
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,159
the world if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try to build a backbone</font>

474
00:18:08,539 --> 00:18:12,770
the way we used<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back down like a</font>

475
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,960
tree you have like access and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cord it's</font>

476
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,309
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work you're going to create</font>

topologies between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nodes in their</font>

485
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:36,678
box how about just make the whole thing

486
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:38,059
a big router as a cube so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

get the fair amount of paths between any

00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:47,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">got so much redundancy that if somebody</font>

494
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:54,450
people doing in this kind of application

495
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,340
like they put an ethernet switch

496
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,220
couple of ethernet switches that put the

497
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:01,020
web server<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they called the</font>

498
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,850
community web page and then it's in that

499
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,129
box and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they have a dsl</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going out</font>

500
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:11,010
for fifty or hundred apartments no fun

501
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:13,470
now why do I bring it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to nanog well</font>

502
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:14,970
if you take a figure and a half million

503
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,590
five megabits port and you say they're

504
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:19,320
all using their old this is worst-case

505
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:22,350
scenario all talk to each other it's 17

506
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,909
terabits per second now this is assuming

507
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,840
that half of the people are waiting to

508
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,850
the other half for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

509
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,830
watching right because i have no content

512
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,060
I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> another 17 tell a bit of a dress</font>

513
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:39,810
going into the network or English going

514
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,520
into the network from whatever if I want

515
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,889
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have three operators which is a very</font>

low number my a single exchange no point

00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:50,580
need to file handle 5.6 terabit per

second on the link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the ISP here if I</font>

519
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:58,590

48th between those three operators and

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,030
if I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to double the capacity every</font>

18 months in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Internet in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the core</font>

523
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,420
back when we usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> play it around with</font>

524
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,639
nine months doubling but here we are

525
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:10,350
dependent on the user getting a faster

526
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,760
pc or something faster so i don't think

527
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:14,429
it's going to go at that speed because

528
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,650
we are taking effect of doubling by the

529
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:18,630
internet core today is taking all the

530
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:20,490
new users into account every user

531
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:24,090
doesn't go faster but here the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

532
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:26,310
to go faster if you double heavily not

533
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:30,300
every 18 months<font color="#CCCCCC"> its OC 48 to everybody</font>

534
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:33,330
in 14 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and then people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey</font>

535
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,040
hey but hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can build OC 48 to my</font>

536

00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,030
and 14<font color="#CCCCCC"> years as a hell of a long time</font>

done but we are going to run into very

543
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,040
very many new problems to solve but if

544
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,330
my cube is actually having multiple

545
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,510
providers how do we have to connect them

546
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,310
together another thing I wanted to

547
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">explain was that people saying hey hey</font>

548
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:03,600
we have voice and you see all those old

549

telcos<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're living up there taxing</font>

you for talking into the phone if we did

551
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,720
something like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody that I</font>
