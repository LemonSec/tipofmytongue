involved with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Virtual Private</font>

7
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:25,320
networking so basically the things we

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:27,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to try to do is talk</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about what is a virtual private network</font>

10
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:33,989
it's certainly a kind of a vague<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vague</font>

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,489
idea lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different concepts so we'll</font>

12
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:37,468
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about talk about that some of the</font>

technologies that technical building

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,180
blocks involved in making a VPN talk

15
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,940
about some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font>

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,090
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a service provider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could offer VPN</font>

17
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:52,949
services and then also talk about the

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:55,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenges around them and some of the</font>

19
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:56,430
proposals and technologies that have

00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:58,410
been developed to address those

21
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,059
challenges specifically in the area of

00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:10,289
interoperability and scalability

23
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:15,030
manageability and such so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

should be yours right so again to

introduce the people Paul myself and

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,450
then care team will be speaking and at

the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have a session for</font>

question and answers would certainly

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,210
encourage you to as we're going through

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,240
some questions you may have well the

presentation that's basically just

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,229
extracted some couple of choice slides

passionately about as an insofar as

there's about people just go<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

like to hang me for some of my opinions

but nonetheless

46
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:13,630
virtual private network of course I

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we'd like to define</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us anytime try</font>

to define communities of interest you

00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,209
look what our communities of interest

50
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your definition of</font>

knowledge of any other existing

55
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:34,959
community now say more about that in a

56
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,930
moment and of course like any other of

57
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,220
our favorite three-letter acronyms VPN

58
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,459
is one of the ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

of religious issues to go ask a math

geek you know what a VPN is the first

thing you'll say is IPSec you know go

ask you know mpls person what a VPN is

64
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:00,489
they'll tell you it's you know it

includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> VP lessers hundreds of</font>

different definitions of what VPN is

68
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,760
there's a lots of market point vendors

69
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,230
who make you know black box VPN stuff

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,190
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not say that's good or bad</font>

71
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:19,840
understand there's lots of stuff there

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay well I like to do is I can't look</font>

really add it or modify it but think of

78
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:40,959
it this way think of the application the

79
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:43,510
protocol stack and think of as a subset

80
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,100
of that the tcp/ip model we've got

81
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,170
application transport network and we

82
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,290
clear Louie I'm even going to include

83
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:53,140
like the physical a five layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> in here</font>

84
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,358
you basically have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pnc a good layer</font>

85
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,708
there so they<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this way link layer</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there was no real good way for them to</font>

do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> across likes a frame relay</font>

of the pack you know packets on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wire</font>

94
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:18,450
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> conceptually satisfies my</font>

definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a V</font>

96
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:27,030

97
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:31,800
networks or ATM networks a public frame

a common layer to infrastructure we

101
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,630
still lots of private networks for

102
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,700
people and basically it fits the ships

103
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:43,710
in the night definition not sure there's

104
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,719
probably some security issues there but

105
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:48,090
as with any security issue you have to

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,540
do a risk assessment to determine how

107
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,590
important it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sku public</font>

108
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,630
you'll see this very well this is

109
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,039
illustrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will talk about got</font>

110
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,800
common layer to instruct like a public

111
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,970
ATM network you've got like<font color="#CCCCCC"> discrete</font>

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,590
layer three networks they have no

113
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,780
conceptual knowledge of one another and

114
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,760
the ships in the night volunteers and

115
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,039
purposes there eg it their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own community</font>

116
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:13,940
of interest that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know technically</font>

117
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:16,470
it's a VPN ok let's look at layer 2.5

118
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,690
mpls not really layer to delay their

119
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,910
three there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of momentum right</font>

120
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:33,270
now on standards track type issues of

121
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:37,710
building mpls VPN ipsec transport layer

122
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:40,469
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2046 SSH you know sexually</font>

123
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:45,359
those are kind of VPN or virtual and

124
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:49,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're private is it a network well not</font>

125
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,320
really good application encrypted email

126
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,200
you know PGP messages you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know or any</font>

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,169
other PGP enabled application any

128
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,510
application was has encryption between

129
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:04,830
communities of interest those are

130
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:06,990
reputed really and so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would go</font>

131
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">back down to the file level you could to</font>

132
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,350
build VPNs out of pulses of light

133
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,940
everybody has their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> wavelength I</font>

134
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,440
mean you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about anyway no matter</font>

135
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what layer the</font>

136
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,050
application stack all the traffic is

137
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:21,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">going over the same pulse of light</font>

138
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:21,440
anyway

139
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,460
so pretty quickly have those<font color="#E5E5E5"> bills</font>

140
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,220
basically lost VPN stick on various

141
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,940
forms is there any right way it depends

142
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,620
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> what problem you're trying to solve</font>

143
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:40,640
you need risk assessment tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> determine</font>

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,250
some of those things boss was kind of

150
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,650
providing the overview I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

151
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:10,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these different technologies in</font>

152
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:13,460
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more detail again trying to</font>

153
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">define a VPN I think this is a challenge</font>

154
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:17,900
that pretty much any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us have faced</font>

155
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:19,609
when either your customers have asked

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide a VPN solution or maybe</font>

157
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:23,480
your boss came to you and said we need

158
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:28,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to offer VPNs try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out what</font>

159
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly it was so a couple of</font>

160
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:33,440
definitions but just to reinforce what

161
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,910
Paul was saying I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think really the only</font>

162
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,610
real true private network is when

163
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:42,830
someone goes me build their own take all

164
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:44,780
the physical plant whether it's copper

165
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,460
wire fiber switching transport

166
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,469
everything so that's a true private

167
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,719
network anything above that in the

168
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,900
protocol static is shared so that could

169
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">be a TDM network or frame relay ATM</font>

170
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:57,409
network etc we're basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

171
00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:01,969
sharing different pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the same</font>

172
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:06,290
facilities but<font color="#E5E5E5"> since this panel is kind</font>

173
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:08,419
of focusing on ip-based VPNs and nano is

174
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:11,090
obviously an or of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet centric</font>

175
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:15,020
body talk a little bit more about about

176
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:19,159
this in detail<font color="#E5E5E5"> so again when we try to</font>

177
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,280
accomplish basically in this case we

178
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,750
have these IP networks that we've been

179
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,059
typically for best effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

180
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,800
connectivity and maybe there are ways

181
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:33,589
and things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do run over that</font>

182
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:36,930
to get enhance the utilization of those

183
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:38,849
that infrastructure rebuilt so

184
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,909
that could be collapsing multiple

185
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,310
networks on to other other networks and

186
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:47,310
other services<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto the existing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

187

network for example in particular a

188
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:54,359
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things would be sharing a</font>

189
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:56,670
local loop if you are a provider and you

190
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,820
have your facility writing lots of t1

191
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:01,560
lines or ds3 lines things like that it's

192
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite painful trying to manage all the</font>

that together by from one service

200
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,339

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:23,490
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier and then and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I kurdi will dig dig into</font>

204
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,600
beyond sharing some of that

205
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:34,620
infrastructure is that is the chance for

206
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,230
the service provider to provide an

207
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,770
outsourcing opportunity and bring some

208
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:44,130
of the network functionality into the

209
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,650
service provider network so it's going

210
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go through a couple of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

remote user access a cpe base to VPN and

213
00:09:53,310 --> 00:10:01,589
then a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> more core based VPNs</font>

214
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:06,270
one more MPLS based and then a provider

part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of presentation so I'll go pretty</font>

221
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:21,300
quickly but I provide some references

222
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,800
throughout so when I'm talking about

223
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,770
remote user access what I mean in this

224
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,020
case are the idea of some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

225
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:29,939
typically a switched user that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

226
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:33,839
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's not constantly connected</font>

227
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,930
to the network getting access back into

228
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,430
via a shared in for infrastructure back

229
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,839
to some corporate headquarters for

230
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:45,779
example and so in the mid-1990s I guess

231
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,620
the 1995-96<font color="#CCCCCC"> time frame</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so a bunch of</font>

232
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:52,089
protocols<font color="#E5E5E5"> emerged 18</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">put up their emphasis a slide bug but</font>

235
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:02,920
these are basically functionally similar

236
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:05,130
protocols that provide this idea of a

237
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">dial-up user connecting into a network</font>

authenticating to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

243
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:23,520
the ITF is<font color="#E5E5E5"> done protocol called l2tp and</font>

244
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,500
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually been issued as an RFC</font>

245
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,939
2616 one and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there were various drafts</font>

246
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,339
to talk about extending that protocol

247
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,290
and we're at a point of maturity where

248
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,290
that's actually starting to be deployed

249
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:40,089
when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a cpe based virtual</font>

250
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,120
private network what I mean there is a

251
00:11:40,089 --> 00:11:46,150
scenario<font color="#CCCCCC"> where either the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

252
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,570
provider or the end user runs some kind

253
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:51,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of technology that runs again on the CPE</font>

254
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:53,920
devices of the network so that could be

255
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:59,250
IP step tunnels running through the

256
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:02,349
network or GRE tunnels or IP and IP etc

257
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:04,860
basically the tunnels run from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> CBE</font>

258
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:08,709
device to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other CPE devices and</font>

259
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:13,060
providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this a logical overlay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

260
00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:15,040
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> common core network an</font>

261
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting aspect of this one is the</font>

262
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,900
service provider doesn't really have to

263
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:22,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">be involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at all if the end user buys</font>

264
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,400
those routers and configures GRE over

265
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:27,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet they're still just IP</font>

266
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,319
packets in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle and the user can</font>

267
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:31,329
run basically whatever they they want

268
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,080
over that GRE tunnel for example or that

269
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,490
ipsec tunnel however is also an

270
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,860
opportunity for the service provider to

271
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:43,510
as either bundling those routers or

272
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:46,420
managing those routers to basically

273
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,660
again providing outsourcing function for

274
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,740
that that corporate user and other ways

275
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:54,370
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service provider can add value</font>

276
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,740
or doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like marking the traffic</font>

277
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,870
is priority if it's VPN traffic versus a

278
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,050
best-effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet traffic as its</font>

279
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:03,529
delivered through the network

280
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:06,229
and this is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that we've</font>

281
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:09,170
seen that many providers are actually

282
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:13,660
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so some of the trade-offs</font>

283
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:16,490
in this model are that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

284
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,810
from from a simplicity perspective it's

285
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,899
actually pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much about the same as</font>

286
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,420
general internet access from a service

287
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,920
provider perspective that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if the</font>

288
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:31,099
client continues to manage the CPE

289
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:33,110
devices but if the if I guess it's the

290
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,820
managing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CBE is the complex part</font>

291
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:36,579
where you have those end-to-end tunnels

292
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:39,050
we have to manage a large number of

293
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:44,750
IPSec tunnels or GLA channels whatever

294
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:48,349
it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one I'll talk about</font>

295
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:51,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the idea of a layer to VPN and a</font>

296
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:54,829
couple different implementations again

297
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:56,390
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul alluded to basically the first</font>

298
00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:59,810
or the easiest way to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

299
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a frame daily or ATM network do</font>

300
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:05,599
you have a frame relay a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> rotors</font>

301
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:08,990
around the edge now be the user could

302
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,700
could manage those routers or they could

303
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,010
be bundled with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> frame relay service</font>

304
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,290
and be a managed router service in which

305
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,930
case the the service provider actually

306
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,279
provides that that is a VPN service

307
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:23,660
interconnecting all the sites of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

308
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,480
network and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of frame really</font>

309
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">an ATM this is actually a fairly mature</font>

310
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,779
you know frame<font color="#E5E5E5"> really has been around</font>

311
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,430
for several years seems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work fairly</font>

312
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:37,339
well and from a service level<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement</font>

313
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:40,370
perspective and in such it's kind of a

314
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:41,839
well-understood model and using the

315
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,520
virtual circuits between the sites also

316
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,990
makes it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do capacity planning</font>

317
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,760
we understand how much traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

318
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,199
from New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Chicago and how much</font>

319
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,439
traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going from chicago to san</font>

320
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:56,689
francisco lot easier<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that rather</font>

321
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:58,880
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a broad internet network so on</font>

322
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:02,329
some of the trade-offs on this one from

323
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">a configuration perspective again if you</font>

324
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:05,269
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to configure millions of virtual</font>

325
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,420
circuits for very large network that

326
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:10,520
could be fairly complex but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

327
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:14,839
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that help to</font>

328
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:17,810
ease that configuration burden the issue

329
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,190
can be as the network grows though we

330
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:23,359
have a large number of virtual circuits

331
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:26,150
that each of those end end routers needs

332
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,740
to maintain a lot of adjacencies and the

333
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:31,459
scaling can be become quite an issue

334
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:33,860
there one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nice things about this</font>

335
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:36,650
is maintaining this model it does we've

336
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">had quite a bit of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a infrastructure</font>

337
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,250
investment<font color="#E5E5E5"> in frame relay technology</font>

338
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:45,920
both in the core networks and in the CPE

339
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:48,950
devices so again it's Paul alluded to

340
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,490
mpls is kind of finding a role here in

341
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:56,510
VPNs also so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> places</font>

342
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:59,360
where this this this model is one place

343
00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:01,880
where mpls can fit in basically taking

344
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,350
what i call a traditional layer to VPN

345
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,820
that's a frame rate<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their ATM based</font>

346
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,340
core and just like several<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we</font>

347
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,470
heard that how ATM would be the core and

348
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:14,180
all services<font color="#E5E5E5"> would run over it it's kind</font>

349
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of flipping that around where you use</font>

350
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,739
ATM or frame relay at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge and use</font>

351
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,770
mpls at the core to carry that frame

352
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">really our ATM traffic and maintain</font>

353
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:27,189
instead of having a ATM virtual circuit

354
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:31,420
now we have an MPLS label switch path

355
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:33,710
going through the core<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this allows</font>

356
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:36,170
the opportunity to run these multiple

357
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:37,820
services over the core the shared

358
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,670
infrastructure the shared mpls

359
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:43,100
infrastructure here's an internet draft

360
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I refer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to here that describes this</font>

361
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,020
and juniper has an implementation

362
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,500
doesn't comply with that drop<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

363
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:53,840
similar kind of technology and this

364
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,100
diagram kind of shows the idea if you

365
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,600
have these subscribers and how did<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

366
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,770
the edge of the network they'd run a

367
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,780
frame relay or ATM encapsulation all the

368
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:09,589
traffic that comes in on a frame relay

369
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,730
dlci gets handed off to an MPLS LSP to

370
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:15,290
make it through the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

371
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:17,089
and then at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> far end the MPLS headers</font>

372
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,649
are taken off put on a frame relay

373
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,589
encapsulation again send it on to the

374
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,929
user so again from from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user</font>

375
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,519
perspective

376
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,029
tains that frame relay model over the

377
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:30,789
ATM model and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i call this a</font>

378
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:32,649
layer to VPN because to the users is

379
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:35,470
really the service provider doesn't

380
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:37,779
touch IP at all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IPX or</font>

381
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:42,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">apple talk or SNA whatever over this or</font>

382
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:46,919
voice even kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of frightening come here</font>

383
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:49,719
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the trade-offs here the</font>

384
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,820
challenge here is it creates an

385
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,889
additional configuration burden so the

386
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">firm the provider perspective they need</font>

387
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:58,869
to do that mapping of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> frame relay</font>

388
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:01,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">galaxy-eyes onto the MPLS LSPs and then</font>

389
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:03,309
back onto the frame rail<font color="#CCCCCC"> ideas DLC is</font>

390
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:04,990
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example so some of that to be I made</font>

391
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:06,428
it but there's still additional

392
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:09,129
configuration that means that it needs

393
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:11,710
to happen and from a subscriber

394
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:14,049
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it looks that's the</font>

395
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:15,879
the end user<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the cpe devices it</font>

396
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:17,110
looks just like a frame relay<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network so</font>

397
00:18:15,879 --> 00:18:19,480
you have the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of scalability</font>

398
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:24,789
issues you have in running a frame

399
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:28,779
realtor or ATM network from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cpu</font>

400
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:30,429
perspective and just in terms of

401
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,869
scalability the same issues you know if

402
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,259
you have the core network has a lot of

403
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:37,029
label switch path now instead of frame

404
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:40,179
relay virtual circuits but conceptually

405
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:42,549
they look very similar and then the same

406
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:47,679
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the subscriber side a bunch of</font>

virtual circuits on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge the the</font>

408
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,029
next model that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk about just</font>

409
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:53,980
quite quite briefly here is what i call

410
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:56,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">a provider based layer three virtual</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">RFC's that talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this 2547 and one</font>

413
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:05,860
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the wall was</font>

414
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,970
just issued as an RC 2764 that that

415
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,320
second one actually talks about a

416
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">variety of jenks but there's quite a bit</font>

417
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:16,360
of coverage of this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> also because</font>

418
00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:18,219
which others yeah well 2547 is one it

419
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">was written by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco folks pretty</font>

420
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:24,700
primarily and 2764 was written by a

421
00:19:21,639 --> 00:19:27,729
variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> including nortel and</font>

424
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,179
whatever they're called these days and

425
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:34,970
somebody else result of a collaborative

426
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:38,330
effort

427
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:40,669
on that one so it's kind of it there's a

428
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:42,408
bunch of RFC's issued in the areas of

429
00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">VPN these are the two that have kind of</font>

430
00:19:42,409 --> 00:19:47,299

431
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:50,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">issued as informational RFC s now so</font>

432
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:52,250
anyway the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea here is that the</font>

edge router is where some of the

449
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,500
complexity starts to appear because you

450
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,690
have multiple forwarding tables one for

451
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:47,059
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the VPNs that are connected into</font>

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:11,809

tables and typically from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a core</font>

466
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:34,520

471
00:21:44,899 --> 00:21:48,229
again from a private provider

00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:55,220
perspective

473
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:58,130
the in as long as the VPNs are

474
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,960
relatively simple then there's a pretty

475
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:03,770
straightforward static configuration to

476
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,780
do but the complexity doesn't just go

477
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,820
away if you have a more complex

478
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:10,190
enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> network you're providing a</font>

479
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:11,540
VPN service for that that complexity has

480
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:13,970
to be handled somewhere in the network

481
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:15,440
and typically the idea here is that the

482
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:20,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">service provider is absorbing some of</font>

483
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,460
that complexity so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same is true</font>

484
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,400
with regard to the subscriber if you

485
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,630
have a simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> network the the it's</font>

486
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,690
fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> straightforward to do that</font>

487
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:34,970
configuration from a scalability

488
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:38,870
perspective certainly again if there are

489
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:41,090
simple networks then it's a very

490
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:44,020
manageable however<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the</font>

491
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:46,010
multiple<font color="#E5E5E5"> forwarding tables there is</font>

492
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:49,040
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> an opportunity if you're</font>

493
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,900
providing the net sourcing or VPNs for a

494
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,510
bunch of large enterprise networks that

495
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,100
have many many prefixes in each carrying

496
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,650
those in the forwarding tables then

497
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,510
decide the absolute aggregate size of

498
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:01,070
that forwarding table in that provided

499
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:04,990
edge box that has a forwarding table for

500
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">each of the VPNs can be quite large and</font>

501
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:11,059
in addition there's typically some kind

502
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,580
of routing adjacency between that

503
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:17,059
provider edge box and the customer

504
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:19,370
Network so there's some some inner

505
00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,168
interplay between those two boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

506
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically that the provider edge box may</font>

507
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:27,679
be running multiple instances of routing

508
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:29,889
tables are routing protocols so from a

509
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,030
scalability perspective of the

510
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,010
subscriber to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network however this</font>

511
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,840
is quite nice where they used to have to

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,790
have many local loops now that can be

service provider does have the

implementing VPNs sometimes though this

534
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:38,070
issue of scalability and providing

more difficult it is to scale that up

00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,389
the first few slides and do the

585
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,100
introduction and give<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll talk a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more a little bit more</font>

588
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,560
want to quickly address the whole VPN

589
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:33,450
market itself from a buying behavior

590
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:35,340
standpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you look at who's mean</font>

591
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,380
who's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in a VPN type</font>

592
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,000
service it's basically everybody out

593
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:41,040
there that the large enterprises the

596
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,490
they look for when they're purchasing a

VPN solution are different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things a</font>

601
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:59,669

602
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,410
their own routers and they and they have

603
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:05,190
essentially their own network that they

604
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:07,590
operate and<font color="#CCCCCC"> run a small</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

605
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,140
the other hand I mean actually today are

606
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:11,580
forced to actually run a network they

607
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,620
have to buy infrastructure and run but

608
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,879
ideally they don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the</font>

609
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:17,280
business of running their own networks

610
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,560
they want a completely turnkey solution

611
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,870
and an outsourced service that will take

612
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:24,330
care of all their needs because<font color="#CCCCCC"> firstly</font>

613
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:26,459
they don't have the money first of all

614
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:27,960
to go by all the means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it essentially</font>

615
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:29,250
all the router and all the different

616
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,960
pieces of equipment that it takes to

617
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:32,910
build a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> together and most</font>

618
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,740
importantly they it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very difficult to</font>

619
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:37,110
find highly skilled people to go build

620
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,950
your own network<font color="#CCCCCC"> service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

621
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,540
where I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of</font>

622
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:42,000
opportunity for providers to come in and

623
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:44,040
add value and expand the VPN offerings

624
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,330
to the overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> market so that's the only</font>

625
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:51,690
non technical side I promise so this

626
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,070
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to understanding what a VPN is</font>

627
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:55,110
and what the definition is Paul just

628
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,700
mentioned the definition as the

629
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:59,340
emulation of a private<font color="#CCCCCC"> network over</font>

630
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,690

641
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,450
telecommuters that might be coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> in on</font>

642
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,950
broadband technologies like dsl or cable

643
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,830
they have a few fixed sights they did I

644
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:33,600
mean it's typically a business that

645
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,949
might span headquarters and a couple of

646
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">sides and they don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the need for a</font>

647
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,830
backbone per se but they still do we

648
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,260
have a requirement<font color="#CCCCCC"> for multi-site</font>

649
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,240
connectivity and then lastly they want

650
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,740
to connect to the internet so which

651
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">means they have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a firewall in-</font>

652
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,720
their own firewalls that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically it</font>

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:49,860
if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at what your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you all know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean larger networks</font>

659
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,530
typically have their own backbone they

660
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,908
have a hierarchical network

661
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:06,649
infrastructure where they have a core

662
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:08,880
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> access and so forth and</font>

663
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:11,220
outsourcing a large enterprise network

664
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,960
is non-trivial you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of it</font>

665
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">in terms of the way they think of their</font>

666

668
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,230
so on and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the requirements</font>

669
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,139
vary as well if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at outsourcing the access it's different</font>

674

you're looking at how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> i tie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

679
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:44,100
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth so let's begin</font>

680
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:45,840
first by looking at how do you approach

681
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,309
this problem of a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise</font>

682
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,289
network and how potentially you could

683
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:51,260
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> an outsourced network solution</font>

684
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:53,250
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this large enterprise the first</font>

685
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">element of a large enterprise network</font>

686
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,840
that we can look at outsourcing is the

687
00:30:54,690 --> 00:31:00,270
core itself and it happens today right

688
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,949
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically end up building their own</font>

689
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:05,220
router network by buying leased lines

690
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,710
from the provider that has evolved to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

691
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,990
model<font color="#CCCCCC"> where its frame relay DLC is and</font>

692
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:12,240
now of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM virtual circuits as</font>

693
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,520
the speeds are increasing for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> core</font>

694
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,140
itself it's moving towards ATM and mpls

695
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,610
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> becoming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the preferred technologies</font>

696
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,049
to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build this core</font>

697
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:22,918
infrastructure and maybe over time even

698
00:31:19,049 --> 00:31:24,900
even lambdas so fundamentally this this

699
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,570
this sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an outsourcing of the core</font>

700
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,899
itself looks like this where the

701
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:30,549
provider infrastructure is all

702
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:32,738
<font color="#CCCCCC">you too and you're providing either</font>

703
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:36,009
frame-relay<font color="#E5E5E5"> dlc is or leased lines or</font>

704
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:38,019
ATM<font color="#E5E5E5"> PVCs or mpls LS fees and the fender</font>

705
00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:40,119
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer themselves owns the</font>

706
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:42,779
routers terminates these circuits and

707
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:46,269
managers are routing between the sides<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

708
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:47,799
layer up in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a service that you</font>

709
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:50,529
can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> an outsourced network</font>

710
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,269
service is when you suck the customer

711
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:54,460
net I mean customers router into the

712
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:55,929
network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called virtual routing</font>

713
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,249
where you could provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> a virtual router</font>

714
00:31:55,929 --> 00:32:01,509
sitting in a box in your network and

715
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:03,549
basically what you end up helping the

716
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:05,589
customer do is to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> rid of the</font>

717
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:08,549
thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of virtual circuits that they</font>

718
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:12,519
have to manage and manage instead

719
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:15,009
occurred or rather a virtualized element

720
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:16,599
inside your network now of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font>

721
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:18,669
management of this virtual router could

722
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:20,950
either be done by the customers

723
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:22,659
themselves which might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case when</font>

724
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:26,080
let's say they have built<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large ospf</font>

725
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:27,609
backbone and they want virtual networks

726
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,379
sitting in the service provider cloud

727
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:31,839
but they still want those virtual

728

and be part of their backbone of Europe

730
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:37,869
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of the provider owns the</font>

753
00:33:26,979 --> 00:33:29,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">just talked about virtualizing the core</font>

754
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:31,779
and all the different options of

virtualizing the core moving on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

virtualizing the branch itself it's

00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:38,649
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worry about in</font>

00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:40,350
virtualizing the branch is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

759
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:43,139
bringing in the telecommuters by

dile connecting multiple remote sites

761
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,679
using frame relay which is the case

762
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:48,629
today but potentially evolving to

763
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,110
connecting fixed sites using things like

764
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:53,669
dsl or cable or even fixed wireless so

765
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:58,439
here you are looking at managing access

766
00:33:53,669 --> 00:34:01,049
managing subscribers and by nature when

767
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:02,549
you're managing access if it's dial<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

768
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:05,280
PPP so you have to have dynamic

configuration and<font color="#CCCCCC"> join it into a VPN</font>

773
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:17,820
then you have to have if you are using a

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,250
fixed site bridge deployment model you

775
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,990
have to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of a dhcp server</font>

sitting in the network that the dose of

the right IP address depending on which

778
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,840
customer comes in so it's it's more of

00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:29,310
an IP address management and dynamic

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,600
and multiple virtual access points tying

786
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,240
into this virtual code which could

787
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially end up being all managed by</font>

788

<font color="#E5E5E5">the provider but more likely there are</font>

789
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,240
some parts of this that will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be managed</font>

790
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:53,339
by the customer and some parts of this

00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:55,199
of it which<font color="#E5E5E5"> will which will actually be</font>

792
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:56,940
managed by you so you have to work out

793
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,810
the interworking relationships and what

794
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:03,240
the agreements are going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so</font>

795
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:06,480
that's sort of virtualization of a large

headquarters where I have some service I

807
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,830
have a few branch offices that want to

808

connect to the shared resource and then

809
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,590
I have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> telecommuter scattered</font>

00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:39,000
you have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the way it looks today</font>

you have to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> medium integral has</font>

to go by their own router they have to

815
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,250
buy the pipes from you guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> from from</font>

816
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:46,050
the providers and manage this

817
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,609
connectivity into a router they have to

818
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,300
buy the internet access themselves by

819
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:52,600
firewall and manage the security policy

820
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,250
is going to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

821
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,310
and in some cases they also provide some

822
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:00,340
VPN capabilities using CP based VPN

823
00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:02,770
technologies using IPSec so you have an

824
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,410
IPSec client implemented on a laptop and

825
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,450
you are dialing into the corporate

00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">network through the internet that sort</font>

827
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,589
of rudimentary form of VPN technology

828
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:13,600
that's being deployed today but we are

829
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:15,880
looking at basically taking this model

830
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,040
forth from a mass market standpoint and

831
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:21,070
looking at how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to outsource this whole</font>

832
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:22,420
piece to the provider at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

833
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:24,280
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn this over to Gil and Gil</font>

834
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,810
will explain a little more in more

835
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:34,750
detail about how we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually end up in</font>

836
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:38,049
just high so I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> cutie the really</font>

837
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,790
good description here and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

838
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,670
pretty good picture of what a small

839
00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:44,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">medium sized business would do today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

840
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:46,600
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that picture</font>

841
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,310
except<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's so many of these</font>

842
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,450
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> medium sized businesses around</font>

843
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:55,029
that nobody can run these networks

844
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:57,069
though the outsourcing of these networks

845
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:59,530
is a wind providing people with service

846
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:01,510
that's simple that achieves everything

847
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:05,290
that this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> does but without them</font>

848
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:06,880
needing to either have a an actual guru

849
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:09,220
that can do fire wall surrounding and

850
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,060
everything else or consultants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the</font>

851
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,859
same so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look in stages at what</font>

852
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,440
piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this network of this picture</font>

853
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">can be taken over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by an outsourced</font>

855
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:28,120
start with convert that picture and keep

00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,730
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet access separate for the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">for that main headquarters site but</font>

858
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:37,350
outsource your access network as a full

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:40,180
service network start off by a provider

860
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:43,930
providing a link to that headquarters

861
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:45,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">that then ties into a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> private network or</font>

00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:49,210
virtual private network just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has remote offices or</font>

864
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:53,080
instead of these remote offices you can

865
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:56,919
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of any fixed line application like</font>

866
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:59,830
DSL or perhaps cable in a way hooking

867
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,940
into these headquarters the fact that

868
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:04,359
they're hooked in this way over

869
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,950
network not over the public Internet

870
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:08,960
provides them with a secure network that

871
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,299
gives them access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their applications</font>

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,240
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is separated skill</font>

00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:17,330
represented here you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1022
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:20,150
when we started whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I walk into</font>

1023
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:23,150
room talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPNs I cannot hold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1024
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:25,310
head for a second because of walking

1025
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:27,230
walking in here and talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPNs</font>

1026
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:30,710
is like walking into safeway talking

1027
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:32,390
about food every<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody has a</font>

1028
00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:33,950
completely different concept of what it

1029
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:37,160
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> every customer wants a different</font>

1030
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:39,830
thing and there seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be more and</font>

1031
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:43,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">more agreement about what the VPN means</font>

1032
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:46,549
but it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty fuzzy so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1033
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,900
important to see what what services the

1034
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,570
customer reading wants to have

1035
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:53,180
outsourced and what the VPN the thing is

1036
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:55,520
it could be anything from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an outsourced</font>

copper wire to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tell me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> outsourced</font>

1038
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:02,360

1039
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:06,250
critical for mass-market scaling without

1040
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:08,330
creating the provisioning automated or

1041
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:11,510
assistant provisioning on the provider

1042
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:13,019
side there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility of scaling</font>

1043
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:15,859
to the actual<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

1044
00:46:13,019 --> 00:46:19,229
that her after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that want these VPNs and</font>

1045
00:46:15,859 --> 00:46:22,469
then customer visibility into networks

1046
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:25,140
is also necessary it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not an opaque</font>

1047
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:27,059
service it needs to be something that in

1048
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,459
order for customers to actually buy into

1049
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:31,559
this versus their existing networks they

1050
00:46:29,459 --> 00:46:35,428
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have visibility at least to the</font>

1051
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:37,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">la's the connectivity and some kind of</font>

1052
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:40,099
accounting logs perhaps security logs

1053
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:45,859
into them important that is outsourced

1054
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:45,859
so I'm pretty much done and covered them

1055
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:55,439
sorry for that last one this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of wraps up the formal presentations</font>

1057
00:46:55,439 --> 00:46:59,609
never take questions and answer I guess

1058
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:00,899
if the lights can come up so we can

1059
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:05,640
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see something up here going to</font>

1060
00:47:00,899 --> 00:47:07,409
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good thanks so there are some ice</font>

1061
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:10,019
around if people have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any questions</font>

1062
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:11,609
about any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this we talked about a</font>

1063
00:47:10,019 --> 00:47:13,169
pretty broad variety of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a</font>

1064
00:47:11,609 --> 00:47:15,869
fairly<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level and I think those</font>

1065
00:47:13,169 --> 00:47:17,009
speakers here are ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address more</font>

1066
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:21,209
details about those different

1067
00:47:17,009 --> 00:47:22,380
technologies kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's really how</font>

1068
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:33,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">does it really work and things like that</font>

1069
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:33,380
so please ask oh hi

1070
00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:56,529
virtual routers and not management and I

1071
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:59,619
kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> wonder it's how how much</font>

1072
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:04,089
customer requirement people have for

1073
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:06,130
that and how much how much management of

1074
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:11,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">your network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would you be willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1075
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:13,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">give a way to all the customers so I</font>

1076
00:48:11,530 --> 00:48:14,800
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a question where everyone</font>

1077
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:17,109
up here is a vendor so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1078
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:19,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">more of a question to the providers in</font>

1079
00:48:17,109 --> 00:48:25,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience in terms you always want</font>

1080
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:25,230
these laniel lawyers the question mr.

1081
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:39,368
nice oh I think it my surround him so I

1082
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:41,890
think the question was how much are the

1083
00:48:39,369 --> 00:48:44,740
end-users willing to kind of turn over

1084
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:47,020
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> outsourced that that kind of function</font>

1085
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,910
things like turning over the routing of

1086
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:51,280
the network into the providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

1087
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:53,649
into some kind of virtual router model

1088
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:59,260
so do any any other providers out there

1089
00:48:53,650 --> 00:49:00,339
have any any insights on that I'm

1090
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,839
slipping some might have some

1091
00:49:00,339 --> 00:49:04,330
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions because david has</font>

1092
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,509
a list of them the he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> compose if you</font>

1093
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:11,170
guys don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I that's</font>

1094
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:13,540
unfortunate if he everyone just wants to

1095
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:15,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and have another great go get</font>

1096
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:21,339
they have like neonode cookies or

1097
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:23,950
something so maybe this is a good

1098
00:49:21,339 --> 00:49:25,000
question is it the case that VPNs are

1099
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:27,098
something that just the vendor community

1100
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:28,510
is pushing on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service providers and</font>

1101
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:32,470
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys really care about this</font>

1102
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:35,020
club certainly it was very difficult for

1103
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:37,348
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually try to solicit service</font>

1104
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:39,900
providers to participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in animals</font>

1105
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:43,190
able to define any to participate

1106
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:46,710
there's a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of disappointing to me</font>

1107
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:47,940
I'm a core router guys so we're kind of

1108
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:50,339
in the middle and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a whole</font>

1109
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:57,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot to do with what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens on the VPNs</font>

1110
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:59,519
in the edge but anyway todd marin from

1111
00:49:57,029 --> 00:50:03,660
envoy formerly known as mr net we

1112
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:05,879
mentally have our sales people responded

1113
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:11,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to an RFP for a private medical network</font>

1114
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:15,150
and being able to reuse the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same skill</font>

1115
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:17,249
sets equipment and so on as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pair</font>

1116
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,769
internet service but actually use

1117
00:50:17,249 --> 00:50:21,269
separate routing tables is very valuable

1118
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:24,859
that's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as having the</font>

1119
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:27,029
customer manage that virtual router but

1120
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:31,078
something something in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

1121

world player we're doing a virtual

00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:41,700
private IP network sup there well<font color="#E5E5E5"> but is</font>

1123
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:44,609
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case that I mean I've the feeling</font>

1124
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:50,339
I get from past couple years of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the</font>

1125
00:50:44,609 --> 00:50:52,380
term VPN civ have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of evolved is it</font>

1126
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:54,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">appears to me like it's people have been</font>

1127
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:55,410
developing the technologies and each one

1128
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:57,180
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies they're kind of</font>

1129
00:50:55,410 --> 00:50:58,379
like tools in a toolbox and people try

1130
00:50:57,180 --> 00:50:59,879
to evaluate what problem we're trying to

1131
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:01,289
solve when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they pick the right tool if</font>

1132
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:04,309
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case that I think that that's</font>

1133
00:51:01,289 --> 00:51:04,309
that's a good thing

1134
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:18,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rest here and actually the interpret</font>

1135
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:22,359
view customers mostly not sort of OB

1136
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:27,630
site or rabbit thanks to do that with

1137
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:27,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">disease but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no access</font>

1138
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:12,450
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the many</font>

1139
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,180
factors here is that all these different

1140
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:18,328
technologies between the lttp etc and

1141
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:21,149
ipsec mpls there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font>

1142
00:52:18,329 --> 00:52:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">tools in the toolbox but a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1143
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:28,790
are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> evolving so maybe specifically</font>

1144
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:30,960
on the area of security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the ipsec</font>

1145
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:33,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">standards suite of standards has been</font>

1146
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:35,040
evolving in the IETF it seems for it it

1147
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,450
seems like decades but maybe that's all

1148
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:39,210
the internet years it's been years

1149
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,950
anyway so maybe I question for the

1150
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:44,250
panelists and then if anyone the

1151
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:45,419
audience wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to address that is what</font>

1152
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:48,000
we think the state of the world is

1153
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:51,020
relative ipsec is it is it ready for

1154
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:58,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">prime time do people really use it and</font>

1155
00:52:51,020 --> 00:53:01,680
is it is it addressing the needs so I

1156
00:52:58,290 --> 00:53:03,420
think the jury's still out I think

1157
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,390
there's another one of those situations

1158
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:09,450
I think where you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market will</font>

1159
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:11,190
decide I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean all of us service</font>

1160
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:13,740
providers vendors alike you're pretty

1161
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,630

from a personal perspective the market

has actually decided yet what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was I</font>

00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:42,328
service providers figured out some way

bring in new revenue in the door and

1179
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:46,169
would they be deploying VPNs all over

by enterprises for implementing VPNs you

00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:32,279
deploying VPNs every virtually every

internet based remote access into

1196

corporations now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I be set based they</font>

1197
00:54:35,429 --> 00:54:41,400
tend to be proprietary ipsec waist and

1198
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:45,089
the interoperable clients for them are

1199
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:47,909
are still not out there my honest hope

1200
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:49,890
is that this year was<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft actually</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sipping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something that it's based on IP</font>

1204
00:54:55,229 --> 00:54:59,339
that will become<font color="#CCCCCC"> a true standard but as</font>

1205
00:54:57,779 --> 00:55:02,609
far as service providers actually

1206
00:54:59,339 --> 00:55:08,609
offering ipsec waste services that is is

1207
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:14,929
yet to happen even S&S April how the

1208
00:55:08,609 --> 00:55:14,929
cost of this man is the really useful

1209
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:29,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">exist yet good very very good question</font>

1210
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:32,360
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually my next my next</font>

1211
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:33,440
question is exactly in that area is and

1212
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,930
you guys alluded to this in your

1213
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,940
presentation about service provisioning

1214
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:40,220
and the idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer network</font>

1215
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:42,320
management so maybe talk about service

1216
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:46,279
provisioning first kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what exists</font>

1217
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:48,200
there and how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it work and is it</font>

1218
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:52,300
standard is it scalable all those kinds

1219
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:54,770
of things so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't off</font>

1220
00:55:52,300 --> 00:56:00,320
we're not here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any product pitches</font>

1221
00:55:54,770 --> 00:56:02,530
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I can say is there are single</font>

1222
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:06,380
vendor solutions that provide

1223
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:09,260
provisioning of VPNs today from more

1224
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:12,020
than one fender however since the

1225
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:14,930
standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VPNs exactly mean</font>

1226
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:17,540
across<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interoperable ipsec mpls or</font>

1227
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:19,190
anything else aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fully there in the</font>

1228
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:21,020
service provider environment you won't

1229
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:23,300
really find a provisioning system for

1230
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,070
something that isn't well defined so if

1231
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:28,490
that's them to be today that a

1232
00:56:25,070 --> 00:56:30,830
provisioning system is a vendor based

1233
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:34,419
provisioning system for a specific

1234
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:38,360
solution but that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> network-wide</font>

1235
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:39,890
our hope is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that within within the</font>

1236
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:42,500
coming years with more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1237
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:44,450
standardization on there would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be tools</font>

1238
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:47,180
that will be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work with some</font>

1239
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:50,450
common base level that's expected same

1240
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:53,569
as it's expected that static routes work

1241
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:55,730
and IP works it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be expected that</font>

1242
00:56:53,570 --> 00:57:00,460
IP second<font color="#E5E5E5"> ike is interoperable and you</font>

1254
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:32,170
issues where people have specific vendor

implementations of some of these things

1256

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also might be the case where</font>

1267
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:06,339
with Virtual Private Networks there's a

whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these different building</font>

over the last I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know a year or two</font>

1272
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:18,970
there have been probably thought we had

1273
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,740
a dozen or<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different proposals that</font>

have come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> describing different</font>

1275
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:27,430
techniques for doing VPNs and I know a

00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:30,550
couple of I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ETFs ago there was a boss on</font>

1277
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:32,379
VPNs but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gut I don't say shut</font>

1278
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:34,150
down at least it it<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't happened</font>

1279
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:37,000
anyway there's this really<font color="#CCCCCC"> know working</font>

1280
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:40,420
group and just interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1281
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:42,580
perspective on how important the

1282
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:46,660
panelists think and certainly feedback

1283
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:48,750
from the from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> audience on how</font>

1284
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:51,220
important is that it be a standard for

1285
00:58:48,750 --> 00:58:53,200
standardization effort for VPNs whether

1286
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:54,850
that's a framework or is it good enough

1287
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">to just standardize these individual</font>

1288
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:59,350
technologies and then plug them together

1289
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:01,450
and let the vendors provide things that

1290
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:03,930
could have helped glue all those those

1291
00:59:01,450 --> 00:59:03,930
pieces together

1292
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:13,470
I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think it would be</font>

1293
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:21,880
difficult if not impossible the I

1294
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:24,609
attempted standardized VPNs simply for

1295
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,200
the because the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second question</font>

1296
00:59:24,609 --> 00:59:28,359
exists and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already standards in</font>

1297
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:30,069
place disciplines of technologies again

1298
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:31,150
from an engineering perspective I'm one

1299
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:33,009
of the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that firmly believe that</font>

1300
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,599
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more knobs that you have in</font>

1301
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:37,359
the more that you turn on the higher

1302

failure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it opposes to your network</font>

1304
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:45,160
so I i I've overheard a conversation in

1305
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the lobby yesterday we're someone is</font>

00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:51,129
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know having like seven</font>

I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you know is going to</font>

too much stuff in there but you know if

01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,210
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got two routers you can probably</font>

1324
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:35,558
standardization of VPNs in other self as

1325
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:38,170
possible I guess slightly different

1326
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:40,569
perspective is it's not standardization

1327
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:42,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">of libyans per se but the technologies</font>

1328
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:44,470
that I mean underlying technologies like

1329
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,619
ipsec and mpls and how you use them to

1330
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:49,740
do VPNs it's basically where there needs

1331
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:52,270
to be some better specifications I feel

1332
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:55,180
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two informational RFC</font>

1333

is the 2547 and 2764 which are

1334
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:58,390
suggestions pretty much on how to do

1335
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,579
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but they're not standard</font>

1336
01:00:58,390 --> 01:01:02,390
there's no real hard core specification

1337
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:04,160
that is how you can go to

1338
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:05,930
things and that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font>

1339
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:09,410
needs to be some work in the

standardization<font color="#CCCCCC"> bodies again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1341
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:13,098
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's possible to define a VPN and</font>

1342
01:01:11,059 --> 01:01:14,809
create a standard around it but if any

1343

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology is underlying the</font>

building of the VPN itself need to be

better specified and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

1346
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:25,089
interoperable so any industry effort in

01:01:21,349 --> 01:01:25,089
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction would be welcome at it</font>

of what i got from all of your

because I don't trust you to keep my

showing up Mitchell excuse right<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

looking inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the package to decide</font>

01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:09,769
where they are going and not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1364
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:12,710
IPF in itself is going to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> flick a</font>

1365
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:16,490
clip applicable and the second thing

1366
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:17,869
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to ask is do I mean it looks</font>

1367
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:19,189
like there's two different things that

1368
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:22,460
are going on and maybe we should

1369
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:24,769
separate them the first one is the

1370
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:29,329
people want to collapse multiple network

1371
01:02:24,769 --> 01:02:31,729
plugs into one so like the t1 pbx plug

1372
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:34,490
the t3 data blog and some other stuff

1373
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:36,289
into one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it looks like the second</font>

1374
01:02:34,490 --> 01:02:39,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">one is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give access to the users that</font>

1375
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:41,839
are coming from dsl or cable modems to

1376
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:44,710
the corporate networks as if you're

1377
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:48,049
actually there so is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid</font>

1378
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:50,029
observation do you think or there's

1379
01:02:48,049 --> 01:02:53,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">something else out there that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font>

1380
01:02:50,029 --> 01:02:55,579
completely always missing I think it's a

1381
01:02:53,029 --> 01:02:58,839
completely valid point is I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1382
01:02:55,579 --> 01:03:01,940
perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer is d are we love</font>

1383
01:02:58,839 --> 01:03:03,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">the nice thing about this is that there</font>

1384
01:03:01,940 --> 01:03:06,470
are all these different things available

1385
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:08,089
and the downside to it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1386
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:09,720

1387
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:13,710
trying to what they're going to deploy

1388
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:15,270
but it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be as it should be the</font>

1389
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:18,990
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are implementing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the networks</font>

1390
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:20,430
that make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that choice it the decision</font>

1391
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:22,830
should not be limited the more the

1392
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:26,970
better if you want to run ipsec with

1393
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:29,250
mpls more power to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it as long as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1394
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:34,700
can do it in functions<font color="#CCCCCC"> nice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say oh</font>

1395
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:36,630
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> right or wrong key management</font>

1396
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:40,189
that's not really right oh well that's

1397
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:43,619
whether or not it exists or functions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1398
01:03:40,190 --> 01:03:46,410
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the observation is that there</font>

1399
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:49,740
are overlaps and dark<font color="#E5E5E5"> complementing</font>

1400
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:52,109
functions there and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no</font>

1401
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:54,118
contradiction between<font color="#CCCCCC"> ring or IP second</font>

1402
01:03:52,109 --> 01:03:56,819
mpls they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different strengths and</font>

1403
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:58,880
they overlap in some places mpls is a

1404
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:02,810
much better traffic engineering tool and

1405
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:05,010
ipsec definitely has better security and

1406
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:07,080
using the two together gives you the

1407
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:09,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">best of both worlds there are some</font>

1408
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:11,549
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do without mpls eat</font>

1409
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,439
where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have empty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

1410
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:16,410
or some things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do without</font>

1411
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,339
ipsec if you have a trusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network and</font>

1412
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:19,670
what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good traffic</font>

1413
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:23,880
engineering for separated outer spaces

1414
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:25,980
there's mpls if you have a fast network

1415
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,200
or traffic engineering is not an issue

1416
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:31,140
but security between different traffic

1417
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:32,339
flows is then ipsec addresses that and

1418
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:37,740
the two together address the whole

1419
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:39,359
problem so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think basically it's like</font>

1420
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:41,220
you said tools in the toolkit you can

1421
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:42,569
put them together and and there are

1422
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:48,270
different types of technologies for

1423
01:04:42,570 --> 01:04:51,180

01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:57,029

around on how to help solve that problem

1476
01:06:56,070 --> 01:07:02,310
design goals is that the VPN the VPN

they're completely separate tables they

never touch yes of course a router oz

1481

only so much memory in so much CPU but

1482
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:18,990
there should not be influences between

1487
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:35,900
the less you do the less CPU consumes

1489
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:47,850
yeah I could again it's a question of

1490
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:50,490
what problem you're trying to solve I

1491
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:53,759
guess right i mean so bgb mpls VPN are

1492
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:55,799
great as long as your VPN reach ability

1493
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,900
is limited to that mpls cloud but if you

1494
01:07:55,800 --> 01:08:00,020
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for multi provider or inter</font>

1495
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:02,550
provider type arrangements then three pn

1496
01:08:00,020 --> 01:08:04,650
you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only appear at the bgp</font>

1497
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:06,270
level but also start fearing at the VPN

1498
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:08,100
level and exchange start exchanging VPN

1499
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:09,630
information and so forth that's an

1500
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">additional layer of complexity that you</font>

1501
01:08:09,630 --> 01:08:14,250
would have to kind of work towards

1502
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:17,279
assuming multi provider or a provider

1503
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:22,880
VPNs are an issue but another thing is

1504
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:25,759
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I can't see any reason why the</font>

1505
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:29,930
traffic a pleasant way to say this I

1506
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:32,430
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically providers are very</font>

1507
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:35,670
protective of their networks they'll

1508
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:37,170
like external people injecting

1509
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:38,310
instability into their network so

1510
01:08:37,170 --> 01:08:40,399
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools that have been</font>

1511
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:43,200
developed in the course of years to

1512
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:47,818
protect your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network like you know drop</font>

1513
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:50,880
packets really fast do select it select

1514
01:08:47,819 --> 01:08:53,460
a package drop when people who flap you

1515
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,020
know more than x times X number of

1516
01:08:53,460 --> 01:08:58,380
seconds and all kinds of little<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools</font>

1517
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:02,640
like that you know lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways to set</font>

1518
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:04,589
up route maps that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify you</font>

1519

prefix length all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of loads right</font>

1521
01:09:06,390 --> 01:09:11,339
here I can't see any reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it would</font>

1522
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:15,089
be any different when you're doing inter

1523
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:17,068
provider VPNs or you know that way you

1524
01:09:15,089 --> 01:09:19,049
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you some common sense and</font>

1525
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:23,310
protect yourself because the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy</font>

1526
01:09:19,049 --> 01:09:26,100
next door probably won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> do it for you</font>

1527
01:09:23,310 --> 01:09:27,480
niggas this question I have a quick

1528
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,620
comment on this one this quick question

1529
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:30,089
kind of digs to the heart of that

1530
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,970
trade-off that I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about too</font>

1531
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:34,439
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nut so it is Paul kind of mentioned</font>

1532
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:39,060
I think with bgp there's certainly a lot

1533
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:42,450
of tools we have where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that provider</font>

1534
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:44,730
to subscriber or user boundary can be

1535
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:46,229
pretty well defined and controlled we

1536
01:09:44,729 --> 01:09:48,540
have a lot of tools to do that that

1537
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:50,339
we've used over time and developed over

1538
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:52,800
time at the primarily at the provider

1539
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:56,160
edge boundary between providers but

1540
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:58,080
they're also<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to manage the routing</font>

1541
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:00,150
can they can be received from a from a

1542
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:03,140
subscriber network into the into the end

1543
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:07,290
of the service provider network it's

1544
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:08,670
where the concern lies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think again</font>

1545
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:13,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the trade-off is if you have a</font>

1546
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:16,500
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough network you can you can</font>

1547
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:19,290
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other kind of routing protocol</font>

1548
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:23,580

1552
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:36,510
that in the end the network and and that

1553
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:41,430
works again in a simple network but as

1554
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:43,200
we move toward more complex out seat

1555
01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:45,230
again outsourcing or a virtual private

1556
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:48,210
network for a larger more complex

1557
01:10:45,230 --> 01:10:52,349
network then you may need to move up to

1558
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:54,780
doing something like bgp however one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the concerns has been or one of the if</font>

1560
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:59,730
the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reduce complexity on the</font>

1561
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:03,990
customer premise and collapse it into

1562
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:06,360
the network running bgp out to the out

1563
01:11:03,990 --> 01:11:07,320
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers device it doesn't</font>

1564
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">really seem like a way to reduce</font>

1565
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:12,599
complexity to me so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

1566
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:15,150
are the again the trade-offs that are

1567
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:17,670
really being faced in trying to make all

1568
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:20,580
these work and maybe we did I think over

1569
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:22,080
time perhaps will evolve the tools so we

1570
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:26,450
understand how to do this better but

1571
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,450
it's still a little a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> early today</font>

1572
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:31,640
if I

1573
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:35,560
just just to add one one thing just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1574
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:40,130
not scare everybody away from<font color="#CCCCCC"> using VPNs</font>

1575
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:42,500
that the in a provider environment at

different mechanisms agree on on a kind

<font color="#E5E5E5">of an opaque core that provides a</font>

01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:09,530
there is no difference there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no issue</font>

1586
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:11,440
the customer sees a static route ospf

1590
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:23,150
information so so it is a different

1591
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:26,000
context a different virtual routing

settling the actual core in the

01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:35,450
overnight things and all the different

1596
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:37,129
VPN implementations that are talked

1597
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:39,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">about for this agree on that i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1598
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:40,520
right sure but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the question was</font>

1599
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">long a line</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you still</font>

1600
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:43,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">have those multiple processes running in</font>

1601
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:47,720
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> device and competing for resources</font>

1602
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:50,230
in that device so if somebody injects<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1603
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:56,030
full Internet routing table into their

01:12:50,230 --> 01:12:58,309
into their local<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP and improve subject</font>

1605
01:12:56,030 --> 01:13:01,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">yessum ugly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things can happen except or</font>

1606
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:03,560
why they're so huh unless there are

1607
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:06,380
other questions or comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> from from</font>

1608
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:08,680
the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh looks right yep</font>

1609
01:13:06,380 --> 01:13:08,680
good

1610
01:13:08,870 --> 01:13:14,700
my question is is every<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor comes in</font>

1611
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,610
and tells me they're ipsec compliant and

1612
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:20,460
none of them talk to each other and so I

1613
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:23,299
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're a little different is work</font>

1614
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:26,400
very more content provider and

1615
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:28,020
independent of any background so we

1616
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:29,280
provide our own VPN services through

1617
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,100
hardware and software and right now

1618
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:34,190
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 50 to 70,000</font>

1619
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:37,920
concurrent software and hardware

1620
01:13:34,190 --> 01:13:39,960
sessions and I guess we're coming up

1621
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:42,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">with issue of when we're going to be</font>

1622
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:45,120
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use more than one you know when</font>

on with like the I guess what is it UNH

stuff or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just happy if there's</font>

there's one prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the next ittf but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

tell your choice I'll steal you probably

1635
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:20,490
know this well I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know record zactly</font>

where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Baker's that they goes to</font>

1637
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:24,450
taking place but you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tracking</font>

1638
01:14:22,140 --> 01:14:26,640
them is one of these the problem has

1639
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:28,530
been a couple of missing pieces in the

1640
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,940
specs some of which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know about some</font>

1641
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:32,070
of which we didn't realize<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1642
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:35,490
important but when we know about that's

1643
01:14:32,070 --> 01:14:37,530
about solved is the certificate format

1644
01:14:35,490 --> 01:14:40,820
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been the big barrier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> base-level</font>

1645
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:43,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">interoperability that there was no</font>

1646
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:45,929
internet standard format for an x.509

1647
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:50,519
certificate so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your interoperability</font>

1648
01:14:45,930 --> 01:14:52,560
tended to depend on who's CAA your<font color="#CCCCCC"> IP</font>

1649
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">SEC vendor was using and trust or</font>

1650
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:59,100
netscape or what have you and now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> p</font>

cakes is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coalescing to a reasonably</font>

1652
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:04,350
coherent mass with luck that will

1653
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:07,889
resolve us<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the moderately near</font>

1654
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:10,580
future the other problem at work is just

1655
01:15:07,890 --> 01:15:13,230
starting on this though there's some

1656
01:15:10,580 --> 01:15:14,550
draft solutions out there he's been

1657
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:18,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the remote</font>

1658
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:21,000
figuration of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it basically dhcp</font>

1659
01:15:18,329 --> 01:15:22,469
over ipsec if you will a few other

1660
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,809
things but that's one of the big ones

1661
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:26,760
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned inside IP addresses once</font>

1662
01:15:24,809 --> 01:15:29,630
you set up the tunnel again vendors have

1663
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:32,070
their own proprietary solutions you

1664
01:15:29,630 --> 01:15:35,460
there is a working group that's being

1665
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:37,679
formed to try to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that issue</font>

1666
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:39,659
yes sir we have to compliment a desire

1667
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:42,119
to use legacy authentication systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1668
01:15:39,659 --> 01:15:45,179
secure ID cards and the Securities and

1669
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:47,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">so on this is also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be doubled</font>

1670
01:15:45,179 --> 01:15:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">up by that work so there are few missing</font>

1671
01:15:47,099 --> 01:15:52,110
pieces finally and there's a place to

1672
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:53,730
beat on your vendors there's the

1673
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:57,900
question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the administrative interface</font>

1674
01:15:53,730 --> 01:16:00,540
is provided if you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a CA issuing</font>

1675
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:02,790
certificates to your client it comes

1676
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:06,510
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your IP SEC box grade and how do i</font>

1677
01:16:02,790 --> 01:16:09,540
take that pickax I ATF standard

1678
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:11,909
certificate out of one client and put it

1679
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,469
into another one format and here you

1680
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:14,839
need to exchange format that's a little

1681
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:16,650
part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you its</font>

1682
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,449
administrative issue it local

1683
01:16:16,650 --> 01:16:20,070
implementation issue they have to be up

1684
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:22,980
on your vendors and say we demand the

1685
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:26,130
ability to run multiple clients with us

1686
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:28,138
server for example and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1687
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:29,880
missing pieces that I see people here

1688
01:16:28,139 --> 01:16:32,040
you know others<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to hear about</font>

1689
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:34,290
so i can bring it back to the ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me</font>

1690
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:35,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">know tomato in there what this would be</font>

1691
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,260
the last blood follow up here so we

1692
01:16:35,969 --> 01:16:40,889
would do<font color="#CCCCCC"> now stop though it might be</font>

1693
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:43,710
sick stuff for a while back we're

1694
01:16:40,889 --> 01:16:45,329
actually not going to use long time

1695
01:16:43,710 --> 01:16:48,119
anybody's CA because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

1696
01:16:45,329 --> 01:16:51,030
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> our do our own because we can't</font>

1697
01:16:48,119 --> 01:16:55,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">afford it for and you got 50 to 70,000</font>

1698
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:57,989
clients so when you know it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

1699
01:16:55,099 --> 01:16:59,820
independent of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> verify</font>

1700
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:01,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whoever comes back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a stat to a</font>

1701
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:07,590
way to import and export certificates

1702
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:09,889
them well Susan says that there is time

1703
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:14,090
for another question if there is one so

1704
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:21,110
but John's yes

1705
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:27,290
yes jar if you don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I can't</font>

1706
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:30,259
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I think that that's the same</font>

1707
01:17:27,290 --> 01:17:32,119
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever any other IP network especially</font>

1708
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:37,040
the big public ones how do you do that

1709
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:39,889
how do multi class to begin with I'm

1710
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:42,230
just kidding of course that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1711
01:17:39,889 --> 01:17:43,909
really I mean you're taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a complex</font>

1712
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:45,559
technology mixing it with another

1713
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,969
complex technology what you end up with

1714
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:49,159
it was another good game with another

1715
01:17:46,969 --> 01:17:52,580
another situation like with the better

1716
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:55,460
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about ipsec with lots of</font>

1717
01:17:52,580 --> 01:17:58,670
different little nuances I quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> frankly</font>

1718
01:17:55,460 --> 01:18:00,739
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could even begin to try to answer that</font>

1719
01:17:58,670 --> 01:18:02,239
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think right now we're just</font>

1720
01:18:00,739 --> 01:18:05,360
still trying to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issues</font>

1721
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:09,138
unicast the end to do multicast you

1722
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:11,540
can't do VPNs we have to mpls VPN unless

01:18:09,139 --> 01:18:15,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not saying that at all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why would you</font>

1724
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:18,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">begin to oh yeah I guess I think multi</font>

1725
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:22,400
VPN multicast would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> another like a</font>

1726
01:18:18,349 --> 01:18:26,119
multi multi cast I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> within one</font>

1727
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:29,000
VPN multicast is multicast it's an IP

1728
01:18:26,119 --> 01:18:30,320
network with its own space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1729
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,540
Vivian happens to connect to the

1730
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:34,280
internet in a public way then multicast

1731
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:37,719
off the public internet will work into

1732
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:40,550
it there's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> new and nothing all</font>

1733
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:42,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's basically the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

1734
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:44,300
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a way of being</font>

1735
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:46,369
able to multicast from a single point

1736
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:50,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">two thousand VPNs at that same point</font>

1737
01:18:46,369 --> 01:18:56,389
unless they agree to peer there in some

1738
01:18:50,690 --> 01:19:01,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that whether or not</font>

1739
01:18:56,389 --> 01:19:04,460
multicast determines its own growling

1740
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:05,960
paths will have an influence on whether

1741
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not you know whether you whether</font>

1742
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:10,099
multi catch is as unique as forwarding

1743
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,719
information or not we'll have a great

1744
01:19:10,099 --> 01:19:12,949
bearing on what type of VPN you can

1745
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:17,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement and have them interoperate</font>

1746
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:21,169
together you follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> me on that because</font>

1747
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">cific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in pls pls is use a unicast</font>

1748
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:25,150
routing system to determine 45

1749
01:19:25,610 --> 01:19:34,769
Howard in caste system which determines

1750
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:39,000
40 paths not based on unicast traffic

1751
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:41,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">interoperate with that that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> makes sense</font>

1752
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:48,869
or am I just is it time for is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

1753
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:51,090
for the bar already I don't know yeah so

1754
01:19:48,869 --> 01:19:54,150
yeah a lot of a lot of interesting

1755
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:56,699
questions I guess so I think with that

1756
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:58,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">will will wrap up and I'll turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it back</font>

1757
01:19:56,699 --> 01:20:00,239

1763
01:20:13,710 --> 01:20:18,809
issues to light so i guess to wrap up it
