aren't familiar the NSI registry split

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,670
off from the NSI registrar internally

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,320
where there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two different</font>

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,780
talking about the NSI registry and we

00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:39,360
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on the NSI registry side</font>

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:42,450
the actual registry began operations in

<font color="#CCCCCC">April fundamentally the core system</font>

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,460

<font color="#E5E5E5">Registrar registry protocol RRP that</font>

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,899
allows registrar's to check for domain

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> understand looking at the the</font>

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:15,960
the actual draft is I believe a draft

<font color="#CCCCCC">a rather extensive cutover process where</font>

we've been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in place a fair</font>

number of processes you know the usual

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,710
101 stuff so we can do that kind of

148
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:11,819
planning and if any of you have been

149

151
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:20,639
deadlines dead on but anyway in terms of

00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:24,568
what's running in terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gtld</font>

153
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,759
program we put out an RFP about a month

154
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:30,349
and a half almost two months ago the

155
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:33,509
whole objective of it was to basically

156
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:36,750
place the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD in root servers that the</font>

as close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

161
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:54,140
wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring some service level</font>

166
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:05,180
levels to continue to support this we

167
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,250
looked at a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different criteria</font>

168
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,950
in terms of evaluating the response we

stages of evaluating those proposals

00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,660
we've done some sites visits and we'll

fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great I know hello okay I'll</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">just do this growth income of course</font>

195
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,320
accelerating and with the advent of the

<font color="#CCCCCC">Registrar registry split this actually</font>

197
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,750
even accelerated more and this is really

198
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,049
essentially putting our resources to the

199
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:46,190
limits for example what it thinks that

200

the other route and<font color="#CCCCCC"> gTLD servers did in</font>

201
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,660
the past was be able to zone transfer

202
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:53,810
off of a and that's really no longer

203
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,650
possible as you know bind is a single

204
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:59,270
threaded process and now when it AAA is

205
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:01,340
so busy trying to answer queries that

206
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,069
when it does a zone transfer it starts

207
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,900
dropping packets like a banjee and we

208
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:09,490
certainly don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to happen it's</font>

209
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:12,650
on a fairly large piece of gear to in

210
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:17,120
getting ready preparing for buying

211
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:19,459
version 9 with multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs but until</font>

212
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,170
it's fully vetted we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick</font>

213
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:26,870
with on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech series okay another</font>

214
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,819
problem two is own propagation and this

215
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,580
is especially true for things that are

216
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,160
on either side of the pond we have a

217
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,710
site in London<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've had some</font>

218
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,770
problems with getting zone transfers to

219
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,990
as well as we have a site that at some

220
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,680
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> will go live that's in Hong Kong</font>

221
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,900
and that also has some problems with

222
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,979
propagation and of course queries per

223
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:53,840
second is growing so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a one of</font>

241
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:40,980
before in terms of what sorts of queries

242
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:44,370
hit a what types of traffic doesn't see

243
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:47,870
and it should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no surprise that a</font>

244
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:52,290
queries are certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most prevalent</font>

245
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:57,120
type followed by PTR and with seventeen

percent MX with six<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Annie going down</font>

says types 33 queries I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font>

250
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,709
what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably Microsoft</font>

251
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:16,080
okay here's a top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route debt service</font>

253
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,570
and of course it's very similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

254
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,420
has about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rough same sort of mixed</font>

with a queries PTR queries MX queries

256
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,839
and so on what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting about this</font>

257
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:33,330
one is a quad a queries actually there's

258
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:37,860
just a little bit off there on the on

259
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:43,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right hand side so maybe ipv6 may</font>

260
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:46,500
happen and here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay gTLDs servers net</font>

261
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:49,050
which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> only handles gTLDs come that</font>

00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">NORC and as you can see a queries are</font>

263
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:53,339
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big thing and of course there's</font>

00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:58,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">no PTR types are very little someone</font>

265
00:11:53,340 --> 00:12:00,150
less really messed up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one of</font>

266
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,450
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> big things is with all this growth</font>

267
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:05,760
is okay how we're going to handle these

268
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:09,360
things working in a 32-bit OS because as

269
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,550
you know a 32-bit OS a image can only

270
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,340
handle four gig that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

271
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:17,130
any 32-bit OS can handle to run a

272
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,600
process and we've been doing some

273
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:22,950
extrapolation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that and saying okay</font>

274
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:25,230
when will<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing died and this graph</font>

275
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,500
isn't quite right where it shows august

276
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:30,870
two thousand is being a 32-bit memory

277
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,090
wall where you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to a 64-bit OS</font>

278
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:37,260
it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's off to the right</font>

279
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:39,570
somewhat but not a lot right now we've

280
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,550
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> some tests internally and been able</font>

281
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:45,240
to show that we can handle

282
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:49,370
about 20 million million delegations for

283
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:53,160
come on a machine in a reasonable manner

284
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:55,470
we're currently at 12 so the time is

285
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,930
quickly coming to where there's going to

286
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:59,339
be a paradigm shift not only with how

00:13:01,529 --> 00:13:10,170
that but also with 32-bit OS is actually

290
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:13,430
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to serve this sort of data ok</font>

291
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:16,019
here's average queries per second for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

292
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,849
and as you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the growth trend</font>

293
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:20,070
is just growing it's just another

294
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,779
variant of what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier same</font>

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay yeah that's straight line and J</font>

297
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,910
that we're trying to do is try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve</font>

298
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:36,410
the problem of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to propagate</font>

299
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:39,689
these zones and remote locations and

300
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:41,310
we're kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of experimenting with doing</font>

301
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:44,100
some alternative means of getting files

302
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:46,050
from here to there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

303
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,240
that's looking perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of promising</font>

304
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:51,510
and satellite-based zone transfer

305
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,290
distribution and we can do some other

306
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:57,810
things like compress the zone files so

307
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,760
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it there in a much</font>

308
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:02,520
smaller size right now zone transfers

309
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,670
about 1.4 gig with<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm has in its</font>

310
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:08,010
present state to growing exponentially

311
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:10,529
and there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be certain some</font>

312
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,240
problems with some other so the other

313
00:14:10,529 --> 00:14:15,270
server operators I need to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

314
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,070
about handling files over to gig son has

315
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,329
some problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and there's some</font>

316
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,310
things you have to do in compile time

317
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,170
options and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to muck with a cut</font>

318
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:26,459
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and bind to actually fix it</font>

319
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:27,839
but we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the latency</font>

320
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:30,060
and congestion over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet getting</font>

321
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,829
to these sites is there's been all sorts

322
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,770
of access problems like I mentioned

323
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:37,620
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for hours for Hong Kong for</font>

324
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,930
example and with the frequency of his

325
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,440
own file distribution this is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

326
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,719
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> being problematic with being</font>

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,029
releasing something and herndon but yet

328
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,770
that zone transfer<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in Hong Kong</font>

329
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:52,050
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> not completed yet for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> previous</font>

330
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,870
day so you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really nasty source</font>

331
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,819
scenarios

332
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,320
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing satellite</font>

333
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:03,290
and if you compress it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get about 120</font>

334
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:06,910
megabytes for come from 1.4 gig so you

335
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,779
can see that compressing it helps and

336
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,130
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we like about</font>

337
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:14,660
doing satellites that will get perhaps

338
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:17,650
some fixed latency and congestion free

339
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:20,510
sort of transport and be able to

340
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:23,300
transport these zones at these various

341
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:25,040
locations in a reasonable time and by

342
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,459
approximately same amount of time at

343
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,890
same time and it will cost less load on

344
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,130
its own distribution servers right now

345
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:36,860
we're using basically hidden

346
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:39,650
distribution servers to propagate these

347
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,830
cells to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the publicly accessible zone</font>

348
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:44,810
servers today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be able to</font>

349
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:48,920
hopefully do some more frequent zone

350
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:51,170
updates now here's a timeline and

351
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,479
frankly this thing is not fully vetted

352
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:56,120
yet so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a lot of faith in</font>

353
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,370
this if things were in a utopian society

354
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,600
this might be true there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

355
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at and be able</font>

356
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure it works and we're just</font>

357
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">barely starting in delving into this but</font>

358
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,990
if so if it does work out well this

359
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:10,700
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like best case scenario being</font>

360
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:14,750
able to put this thing out and say end

361
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,890
of may so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to kind of</font>

362
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,690
switch gears a little bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

363
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:21,290
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> us security since that's kind of</font>

364
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:23,390
against more visibility now been able to

365
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,900
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a number of workshops in</font>

366
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:29,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sweden in the US and one of the things</font>

367
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:33,170
that's resulted in this is that is these

368
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,380
things are non-trivial<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up and it's</font>

369
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:38,029
kind of complex and it doesn't help that

370
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:42,860
the current implementation is really

371
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:45,260
buggy and I in that bind the<font color="#CCCCCC"> by neck a</font>

372
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,300
textear yeah sure it cannot go ahead and

373
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,459
display your keys and show your cigs and

374
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,839
and be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do NXT records but</font>

375
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:55,189
actually being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to verify these</font>

376
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:56,120
things is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> so easy and so one of the</font>

377
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:59,240
things that's going to come up for

378
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:02,089
example is on being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

379

00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:07,069
things going to be in a sec world no

381
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">longer will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you be able to be able to</font>

382
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:11,658
get a and

00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:15,189
query for dot with DNS SEC enabled

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:27,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work in an e DNS aware server and so</font>

387
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,549
in by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nate x-series just is not going to</font>

388
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,799
work for this so we got to look at by

389
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:34,240
nine<font color="#E5E5E5"> before Dean a sec actually comes</font>

390
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,710
you in close to implementation so

391
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,090
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that this means is ok if</font>

392
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:39,590
this does happen how is all this going

393
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,289
to work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this registrar registry</font>

394
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,779
split well what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to happen as you</font>

00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">as clients will go talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:06,529
and say okay and the registry will say

allow for keys to be signed through

as well as protection of the private key

00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:29,780
anything further so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll light so</font>

429
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:31,820
any questions so that in banquet to your

430
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,620
price information technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

431
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,840
wondering if there's any thing besides

432
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:41,989
the ssl authentication going between the

433
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:44,270
various registrar's there's sslv3

434
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:47,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">between the registrar's in the registry</font>

435
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:50,110
and then within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFP session there's</font>

436
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:57,740
also a password user ID password

437
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:59,570
authentication and kiya shon darlin

438
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,040
actually I'm hoping bill Manning's in

439
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:05,689
the room because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is probably more</font>

440
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:08,240
from him choosing the locations on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

441
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:10,310
network to put these particular servers

442
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,990
is always an interesting issue because

443
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,899
the network tends to be organic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

444
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:18,110
grows to wherever the servers are put as

445
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:21,020
we even saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> with NSI I mean we can</font>

446
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:26,179
remember the days of them with their t1

447
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:28,210
line in 1992 or whatever so how are you

448
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:32,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to decide where to put these</font>

449
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:34,190
servers when the network will change

450
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,370
depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you put the servers</font>

451
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:40,960
and if bills around I would be

452
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:43,520
interested in his research<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that too I</font>

453
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,740
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bill but I can</font>

454
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,840
somewhat speak for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roots / operators</font>

455
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:49,910
as well and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that the</font>

456
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:53,389
roots / operators are doing right now in

457
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:56,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">conjunction with kata is to run skidder</font>

458
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,360
they'll find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how close our various</font>

459
00:20:56,150 --> 00:21:03,410
sites are today to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the various end</font>

460
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,090
points that are querying us now it one

461
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,830
of the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know is how</font>

462
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:09,530
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have engineered the networks</font>

463
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,480
to get closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the root servers and as</font>

464
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,190
you spread these things out is there

465
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,740
going to be in sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of reengineering to</font>

466
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:19,820
put them closer to this or that as they

467
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:21,770
move okay so you're using Skinner a

468
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:25,510
skinner it's a tool that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using for</font>

469
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,510
the root server operators okay

470
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,800
