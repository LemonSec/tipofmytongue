morning there we go there we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go remember</font>

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,019
i come from a university we're supposed

otherwise you don't get a good grade

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:25,980
this panel is called tersely filtering

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,570
panel that's content free so I'm trying

9
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give a little bit of context but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Billy basically it has been rumored but</font>

and my errand insurance wouldn't cover

it please don't do that so what I want

57
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:16,890
discussion ensued and just because these

58
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:19,140
sometimes the essential points get

59
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,238
accidentally lost in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour mailing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">list discussions to put it politely a</font>

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,970
couple of us said maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should do</font>

62
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:34,410
this as a panel and essentially there

63
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:37,260
have been incidents in history some of

64
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:44,010
them pretty famous like the 7007

65
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:46,350
incident and the 129 / 8 incident where

66
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:50,130
massive amounts of routes were

67
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:53,340
accidentally leaked into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net and</font>

68
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:57,780
brought down significant parts of it the

69
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:03,530
129 / agents then took down two very

70
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:08,690
large providers for units measured days

71
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:16,019
nationwide so the more paranoid of us

72
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:19,228
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of filter routes based on different</font>

73
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,889
criteria we literally don't talk much

74
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:24,330
about how we do it between

75
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:27,939
I don't really know how Danny filters

76
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,008
and and there's a website on<font color="#CCCCCC"> which our</font>

77
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:31,870
current filtering policies posted and if

78
00:04:30,009 --> 00:04:36,310
you called are not they point you to it

79
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:39,400
I don't know where it is myself but I do

80
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,409
know how to log on and I still remember

81
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,748
how to log on<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some of our rallies</font>

82
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:46,659
this is actually a very live rather

83
00:04:43,749 --> 00:04:49,539
that's how I mean thanks to wireless and

84
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:56,250
everything that that is a Seattle router

85
00:04:49,539 --> 00:05:00,580
and that's its route<font color="#CCCCCC"> filton policy and</font>

86
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:05,259
here you see the default route being

87
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:14,849
filter here you see a policy that says

88
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:18,009
in a space<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accept a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nine-team</font>

90
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:29,219
know that an is allocating 20s<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

91
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:35,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're seeing is we filter based on</font>

what we know of<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin and wipes etc</font>

93
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:42,399
allocation policies the philosophy is

94
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,589
that's what they're giving out that's

95
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:48,279
what you should be announcing you

96
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:49,960
shouldn't be announcing more but we're

97
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:53,729
not filtering on that although i'll show

98
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:56,710
you a case where we are actually um and

99

you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be chopping it up into /</font>

107
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,758
varied there's been much discussion we

108
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:27,370
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that different providers have been</font>

109
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:31,249
more strict about<font color="#E5E5E5"> city space currently</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">we take old si space as you say it</font>

111
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:41,689
um what can you say this is actually

112
00:06:39,019 --> 00:06:43,399
more running on the router so and

113
00:06:41,689 --> 00:06:47,839
there's a lot of packets between here

114
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:50,059
and there we also get have the standard

115
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:55,339
filters people come to expect and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

119
00:06:59,929 --> 00:07:11,318
other tasty things like that the RFC

127
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:41,779
reject a very specific route looks there

128
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:46,879
we go we blew it didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we close it up</font>

129
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:50,569
or down we'll never find it again there

130
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,519
it is a very specific route because

131
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:55,039
somebody is announcing a route they were

00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,250
from being brought down by the next

149
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:59,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">you live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well I don't any audio or</font>

150
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,880
video aids I guess so I'll just kind of

151
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,130
lean this basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do pretty much</font>

152
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,230
exactly what very obtaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> mcpherson</font>

00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,780
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> qwest with you pretty much exactly</font>

154
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:11,670
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> vario it does we filter based on</font>

155
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:15,150
registry allocations because we think it

156
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,069
makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense a few other just one other</font>

157
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,540
thing we do the I didn't see Randy

158
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:21,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">mentioned which kind of makes sense i</font>

159
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">think is uh we don't accept</font>

160
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,230
advertisements of our routes from our

161
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,820
peers in other words if you know we

162
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,920
don't allow them to source like<font color="#CCCCCC"> rouse</font>

163
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,980
their subsets of our our solder blogs

164
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,839
are super nice just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

165
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,180
shouldn't be advertising those we do

166
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,130
have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home customers with some</font>

167
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,599
exceptions and that's something we

168
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,430
really like to get around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was</font>

169
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,920
like part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron micro</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bluff</font>

170
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:47,239
allocation thing last night whatever but

171
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,810
that's that's the reasoning for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

172
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,550
where we really like to go is 220 to a

173
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:56,609
world where we could filter routes from

174
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:59,160
our peers all routes on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> prefixed</font>

175
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,320
piraeus basis but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're a long</font>

176
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,449
way up to to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and to</font>

177
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">be able to do the source address based</font>

178
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,250
filtering presumably with the the same

179
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,790
policy so that spoofing wouldn't be an

180
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,860
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain as well based on some</font>

181
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,839
back-end database or some bgp

182
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,900
authentication mechanism i think is the

183
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,520
way to go and until we get there anyone

184
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,010
could take a room<font color="#E5E5E5"> named server you know</font>

185
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,540
mostly offline or do pretty much

186
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,890
whatever with the BGP route

187
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,069
advertisement which is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ugly</font>

188
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:31,170
stuff that's uh that's pretty much it i

189
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:32,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">think you know as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far as why and what</font>

190
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,709
not it's pretty much just as Brandi said

191
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,690
because we think it's the right thing to

192
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,590
do then if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't like it well it's</font>

193
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:50,460
unfortunate<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's it</font>

194
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:52,920
so we specifically do accept subsets of

195
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:59,610
our blocks from our peers because of the

196
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:03,150
multi home customer and that that but

197
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:06,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not saying Danny's wrong on this</font>

198
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:12,329
does vary widely between major ISPs and

199
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:15,810
some do some don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay other two panels</font>

200
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:18,390
are here not as ISPs but as people

Randy who is learning to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pointed out</font>

205
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,750
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an interaction</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> between the</font>

they're here in cases questions on

controversial topic

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:36,920
regard to accepting subsets yes it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

221
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,240
a big issue today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we have a few</font>

224
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,140
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's not the norm and if</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">someone screams loud enough for what we</font>

will do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because it makes sense but</font>

227
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,560
as a general rule to not accept our

<font color="#CCCCCC">advertisers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from our peers especially</font>

229
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,530
the important blocks like our internal

00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,329
name servers and our mail servers and

00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot it's something that we</font>

232
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:59,780
definitely think is right and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

233
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:02,210
it's insane if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

234
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:03,829
someone could not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only wait your</font>

235
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,570
customers would break<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network by</font>

236
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:12,920
advertising your routes to youth and

237
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:15,560
that can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very ugly for example if you</font>

238
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,219
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter lothbrok as a customer and he</font>

advertises you out back to you it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

241
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,620
exciting anyway fit theoretically

242
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:47,589
any other questions comments that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

243
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:49,089
we're now way ahead of soon yeah way

244
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:53,080
ahead of schedule let me think for a

245
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:55,630
second um we could have Greg talk now or

246
00:13:53,080 --> 00:14:01,589
we know it's too early to go out for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

247
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:14,980
break so won't be there Craig<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh God</font>

248
00:14:01,589 --> 00:14:17,020
let's see you want to yet the suggestion

00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:19,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">was made to recap the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> micro allocation</font>

fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we want to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again so just</font>

252
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:30,339
wanted to use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> John wants to say</font>

253
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:33,820
something first John claim from the ripe

254
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:35,680
NCC we're actually doing a lot of work

255
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that actually looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the routers at</font>

256
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,160
the moment to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them what's actually in</font>

257
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,600
the BGP table and I wonder how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

258
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">people actually know what they really</font>

259
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:45,850
look like some people here going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

260
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:48,310
a talk from our organizations afternoon

261
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:49,720
on some of these projects and one of

262
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:51,790
them came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me the other day with some</font>

263
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,589
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what's actually in those</font>

264
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:59,020
tables we could see 82,000 separate

265
00:14:55,589 --> 00:15:02,620
prefixes across seven peers more than

266
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,810
fifty percent of those r / 24 of the

267
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,029
prefixes that they see so we have this

268
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:10,119
forty four and a half thousand / 24

269
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:12,430
prefixes in the routing tables which<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

270
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,770
we've got a double check it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

271
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:19,000
quite surprising and three and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half</font>

272
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:21,040
thousand /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 s so that there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

273
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,260
of these small<font color="#E5E5E5"> rocks actually being</font>

274
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,310
routed it's not just a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount it's</font>

275
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,860
a large percentage of what we're

276
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,239
actually seeing I just wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> check</font>

277
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">off I think people should probably</font>

278
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,700
actually go and look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk i'm</font>

279
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,750
going to do a nice plug here and should

280
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,310
actually go and see what these people

281
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,310
have got to say it's quite interesting

282
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,880
well um I live near here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I left my</font>

283
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:46,180
laptop at home so I don't have my groovy

284
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:48,670
little slides we had a micro allocation

285
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:51,339

287
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:57,550
Advisory Council which I'm on we

288
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:59,829
recommend policies to Aaron based on the

289
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:02,290
community input and what the members of

290
00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:03,839
Aaron think and stuff like that and one

291
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:07,689
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're getting requested</font>

292
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:12,279
quite a bit is for longer portable

293
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:14,380
blocks for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of things like a key</font>

294
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:17,829

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:20,139
infrastructure some<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers at</font>

296
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:21,219
companies that are multihomed think that

297
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:23,500
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know they need a portable</font>

that you know they can't justify a slash

302
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:35,800
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we you know had a quite lively</font>

303
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,069
discussion that lasted two hours

304
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,880
remarkably about you know what you as

305
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:45,610
ISPs think of that if you know if we

306
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,470
took a block say that's a well-known

307
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:51,550
block that could be defined by net and a

308
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:54,490
mask and broke it up into you know some

309
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:56,790
longer allocations that that wouldn't be

310
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:59,980
subsumed in a larger cider at

311
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:01,899
advertisement and we didn't come to a

312
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,270
lot of conclusions we had some people

<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron one is for interconnect point</font>

00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,630
an interconnect point is and that

321
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,660
they're not globally routed but they

322
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,980
need to be unique and for root

323
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,270
nameservers those are the two things

324
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so far we've been able to</font>

328
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,220
basically we know what we discussed and

329
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:45,130
now the AC is going to go back and

330
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,290
discuss it<font color="#E5E5E5"> two more and if you all have</font>

332
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:54,460
oh oh and another shameless plug for the

333
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,360
errand of the policy meeting april third

334
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:01,600
through fifth in calgary yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

335
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,399
have one question<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff Rozelle um I was</font>

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">you say NT servers and TP NGP okay that</font>

339
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,370
was good totally unintentional yet funny

340
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:30,610
um I think maybe I'd like to stress why

341
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:33,190
people want micro allocations I wasn't

342
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:39,570
that the bomb but a lot of other people

343
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:42,250
here also want and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to think</font>

00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm so it's taking and speaking to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:31,750
they can quite happily with / 24 of

356
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:36,700

361
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:52,240
some of these providers have said is

what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have customers will see me</font>

363

<font color="#E5E5E5">registrations for instance were to take</font>

00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:12,610
for these kind of allocations then<font color="#CCCCCC"> mine</font>

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:36,550
why would they<font color="#E5E5E5"> let those people have</font>

388
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:22,390
with this is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you define a web</font>

389
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:24,370
server of significant whatever so is you

390
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,260
know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can identify the ones that</font>

391
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,510
we know we think are significant because

392
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,370
everybody thinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that their their site</font>

393
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:33,340
or their business or whatever is

394
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,199
significant and and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

395
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,389
could put some sort of definition around

396
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,400
it and bounce around it that could

397
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:41,710
actually be measured or enforced or

398
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,809
whatever then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we it would be</font>

be a talk or just<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the break this</font>

some concrete information I'll do that

595
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">but what I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is for</font>

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:55,550

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:07,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">point I wanted to make and I think it's</font>

601
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:09,350
a very valid point just to agree with

602
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">you on that there are routers there the</font>

603
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:13,520
next generation routers are all saying

<font color="#E5E5E5">quarter million routes mobile but note</font>

605
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:18,500
that as you will hear cleaner on today

606
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:21,560
it's not simply a matter of memory space

607
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,790
or processor speed it's a convict<font color="#CCCCCC"> oriole</font>

608
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,560
problem the bigger the routing table

609
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,270
more often it changes the more often you

610
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,010
have to do processing the more

611
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:30,110
processing you have to do not linearly

612
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:32,600
but more than that you've got additional

613
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:34,490
path information<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're set your go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,449
store and you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this additional</font>

615
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,130
information you've got to move around

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network it's it's not a simple</font>

when RC 2050 which is the current

allocation policy was determinant and it

622
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:54,260
and policy should be determined based on

623
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,850
what we think we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have rather</font>

about this because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font>

this policy on or whether there's going

we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make sure that that you</font>

understand what we're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and</font>

644
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:47,100
that we get input from the community so

645
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,899
that's more of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question for this group</font>

646
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,360
and that's why you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can tell you</font>

647
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:55,170
what i think is an isp but that may not

648
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:58,770
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay ready and you</font>

649
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:01,290
want a decision yes the next generation

650
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:04,080
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> rather's can take larger routing</font>

651
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:06,480
tables but you know our equipment

652
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:12,990
depreciate faster than 32 feet per

653
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:18,180
second squared that still is month that

654
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:23,130
is still finite time so there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> folk</font>

655
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:28,890
with not that don't have next generation

656
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:32,940
drivers out there and and if i SAT here

657
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:35,570
with large fancy robbers and advocated

658
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,880
policies which put at a disadvantage

659
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,889
those people who didn't have large fancy

660
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,080
routers<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

661
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:47,040
comment on that and that comment would

662
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:50,580
be justifiable but to get back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

663
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:55,020
base question on Targ you the other side

664
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">of my point is um you want to add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 or</font>

665
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,629
30,000 more routes for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group</font>

666
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,979
justifiable reason yeah we can eat them

667
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:10,410
per foot once again jumper on a highway

668
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:12,659
um one is one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked</font>

669
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:15,060
to a lot of the rule eyes peas about him

670
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:19,560
and I appreciate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the errand policy</font>

671
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:21,690
meeting is in Calgary Canada as opposed

672
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,350
to places where a lot of these rural

673
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:27,900
ISPs can afford to<font color="#E5E5E5"> travel to I think one</font>

674
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:32,009
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we see is how do</font>

675
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">we get that input into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin in a more</font>

676
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,060
too

677
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:38,790
fashion and how does that information

678
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:42,270
really review because I look at the AC I

679
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:46,949
don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the small provider</font>

680
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:49,770
well recommended or well the ACSM<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

681
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:52,080
the AC is elected by the membership so

682
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:54,389
please I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and and and</font>

683
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">we give the whole membership a whole</font>

684
00:34:54,389 --> 00:35:00,870
membership the whole membership issue

685
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:04,740
but the real question here is the fact

686
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:07,890
that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the small ISPs don't see a</font>

687
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:10,649

want to become a member and go spend

689
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,650
that money to get out no input a note

690
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,390
and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to go we're not</font>

691
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">going down that road there's no extra</font>

693
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,270
dollars a year yeah they're going to get

694
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,830
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> space for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Marin you remember I</font>

695
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,270
understand that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing</font>

696
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,120
micro allocations than how do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

697
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:30,360
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's an open there's an open</font>

698
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,880
mailing list yeah we've struggled with

699
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,940
this food for years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so from the ripe NCC</font>

700
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,170
perspective its outreach you have to go

701
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,850
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that these</font>

702
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,260
policy meetings are taking place<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

703
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:43,610
more importantly that the mailing list

704
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,780
of that and they can't give input I mean

705
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,040
you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach everybody but</font>

706
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,420
you can reach a lot of people if you

707
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,250
actually reach out<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and so you get</font>

708
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,620
all these mailing lists agree and I

709
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,870
think that I think my summary statement

710
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:59,130
there is is that Aaron needs to do far

711
00:35:54,870 --> 00:36:02,250
more outreach to the community than what

712
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,650
it's doing today okay we were to two

713
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:07,110
things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are here all three things ok</font>

714
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,850
we are here doing some outreach and to

715
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:11,610
the reason the meeting is in Calgary

716
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:14,160
Canada is because a kind soul in Calgary

717
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:16,170
Canada<font color="#CCCCCC"> often offered to host it and so</font>

718
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,910
if you're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to host a meeting in</font>

719
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,380
one of these rural areas i'm sure that

720
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:21,029
we'd be more than willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

721
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:23,430
meeting there the other day or even

722
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:27,330
extended all right great<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can talk to</font>

723
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:29,520
Kim the other thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the AC</font>

724
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,770
members are nominated and elected by the

725
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,130
membership and you don't have to be a

726
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:36,660
member to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be elected to the AC so if you</font>

727
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel that there's somebody in one of</font>

728
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:40,290
these locations<font color="#CCCCCC"> who wants you know you</font>

729
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:44,370
want to have on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AC to represent</font>

730
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,800
these these folks then nominate them and

731
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,270
you know they

732
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,760
have just as good a shot as anybody else

733
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:53,660
the other point is hard route table

734
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,760
issued and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott said about the</font>

735
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:58,609
growth and so forth is in fact a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

736
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,700
important valid thing but I also<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit</font>

737
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:05,150
back and I wonder why are some providers

738
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,710
out of their takings let's say 63 / 8 in

739
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:08,990
their various assignments out of there

740
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:13,070
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregating them down to the size</font>

741
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:14,629
24 level or I think I saw net 12 was

742
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,910
doing a lot of that recently as well

743
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:19,010
which is injecting a lot of routes into

744
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:21,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world we could probably help clean</font>

745
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:28,130
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up and that would help</font>

746
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:31,390
those routes he filters okay bad books

747
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:35,300
do you read<font color="#CCCCCC"> that purpose your choice</font>

748
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:40,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay hi</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> women</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> curly representing</font>

749
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:42,830
nobody and doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway up with the</font>

750
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,150
comment that was made to over there the

751
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:47,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">responsible attend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to point out</font>

752
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:48,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these days that as far as number of</font>

753
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,570
routes and the router table goes that's

754
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,820
overall size and memory allocations and

755
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:54,890
not is no longer necessarily the primary

756
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,660
issue but<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it pointed out it's</font>

757
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:57,859
processing sizing and stability the more

758
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:59,240
routes you add in there the greater the

759
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,100
odds are<font color="#CCCCCC"> that something is going to go</font>

wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that's something that</font>

shrink the routing table size but rather

to lessen the rate of growth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we understand Stan what's</font>

771
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:32,060
going on with respect to filtering it

772
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:34,700
against erence allocations I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slight modification to that</font>

774
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:39,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are organizations out</font>

there that are attempting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some</font>

reasonable a implementation of

geographical med based distributions of

778

their of their new locks so somebody may

779
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:52,210
get a slice 13 and split it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a new</font>

780
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:54,310
couple into some slide 16

00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,200
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> advertise those to their peers</font>

782
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:59,140
to try to encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best entry</font>

00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,000
policy and you know filtering against

the film us<font color="#CCCCCC"> the entire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> block doesn't</font>

785
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,330
permit that now by the same token those

786
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:08,368
people who split that up would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fools</font>

787
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:12,609
to not also source the original / 13

788
00:39:08,369 --> 00:39:14,589
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they got it it</font>

789
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:16,420
says to the rest of network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is my</font>

block it's advertised for my network if

you want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it come to me it also</font>

disappear off the network well the

00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,660
traffic doesn't get black hole there it

798
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,490
gets black holding your network which at

799
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,710
least has it gives it a chance of

800
00:39:36,490 --> 00:39:44,649
getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> through in the first place Thank</font>

801
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:47,230
You Kathy um when<font color="#CCCCCC"> is bad yeah what kinda</font>

802
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,330
porn be gotten for the backbones

803
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:54,339
listening to the smaller blocks when

804
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:57,580
they do get proposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> are they you mean</font>

805
00:39:54,339 --> 00:40:00,160
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boss last night yeah um I I</font>

806
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:03,098
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the well I can I'd hazard to</font>

807
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,480
say that we had consensus but there

808
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:07,390
certainly were a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

809
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,530
felt that if there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a defined policy</font>

810
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:14,740
and it was a bounded block that that you

811
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:17,589
know baby that they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thought that</font>

812
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:20,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">was okay but defining the policy is the</font>

813
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:22,750
issue and deciding what length and and

814
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:24,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of stuff is really the hard</font>

815
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:27,490
part about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if we could actually</font>

816
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:30,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">do that then you know they seem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

817
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:32,649
you know in favor of that no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

818
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:34,990
know if that answers your question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

819
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that everybody won't adopt</font>

820
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,129
it rather than some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying well</font>

821
00:40:36,730 --> 00:40:41,530
we thought we had the space<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our</font>

822
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:43,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">runners to afford a notice and we can so</font>

823
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:45,220
i decided to filter back the old ways

824
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,839
again well note that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

825
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,359
very beginning we can talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

826
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about what people can use</font>

827
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,529
for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own decision processes but as</font>

828
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:56,200
a community we can't make decisions

829
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,810
about things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there any</font>

830
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:00,700
trust issues about everybody agreeing on

831
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:01,299
this is not the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can do we can</font>

832
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font>

833
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:08,560
we've heard from the ISPs here they you

834
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:10,660
they they take the registries policies

835
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:14,230
as part of their decision process on how

836
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:16,899
they decide things other ISPs may or may

837
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:18,520
not they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to say yeah i</font>

838
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,140
know i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not saying we you know we're</font>

839
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,570
trying to force anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm just trying</font>

840
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:25,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know our people agreeing are</font>

841
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,710
people giving support certainly the

842
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,660
thing i<font color="#CCCCCC"> could see happening right is</font>

843
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,730
that right now if your<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual homes and</font>

844
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,379
you advertise the longer prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

845
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,720
subsumed within an aggregate that's

846
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,790
reachable and route it anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if if</font>

847
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,040
it isn't if somebody filters that they

848
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,870

849
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,370
there'd be a block and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if somebody</font>

850
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:43,870
filtered the block you couldn't get to

851
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:46,029
any they couldn't get to any one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

852
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:48,009
folks in the block but conceivably they

853
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:50,050
could charge you if you wanted them to

854
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,730
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your advertisement but you</font>

855
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:53,410
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

856
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:56,410
room would do and we certainly can't

857
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:57,879
suggest that but you know there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

charging for rent here at home charcoal

860
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:06,700
rattles yeah we'd be rich by now

861
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:08,410
actually that brings up on Thank just

862
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,210
one more since you brought up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue</font>

863
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">of charging I mean there's people like</font>

864
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:17,260
us who obviously we don't care about

865
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">money but it's LED TV by the way but you</font>

866
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:22,090
know you have a Rolls who will say you

867
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:24,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I could only afford so many charges</font>

868
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,610
to advertise so many smaller blocks and

869
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:29,020
then what do i do after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point</font>

870
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,570
charge your customers more I guess yeah

871
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:34,360
that precious economics that's the whole

872
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,130
point of this wonderful method of just

873
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:39,370
charging for route advertisements it's

874
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,930
that the marketplace decides whether you

875
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:45,250
think your information is valuable

876
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,950
enough we'll see actually over here hi

877
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:49,690
Patrick Gilman from onyx networks I

878
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:51,100
didn't meet the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boss last night and I</font>

879
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">think everybody here probably knows my</font>

880
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:55,700
views on the aggregation and smaller

881
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,500
blocks but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

882
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,439
okay well then you're miss my boss last

883
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:03,470
night but I noticed it Danny and Randy

884
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,390
both allow smaller blocks through their

885
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:07,459
filters when somebody multi homes and

886
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:09,200
most of the other large networks that I

887
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,270
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like you net and sprint don't</font>

888
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,930
filter on large blocks that filter on /

889
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:16,460
24<font color="#E5E5E5"> s at least that I've seen and I</font>

890
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:18,379
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home say</font>

891
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:19,820
a lot of times they're told by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

892
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,359
they go to their provider they get a

893
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:24,950
small block<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2423 maybe a 22 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

894
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,060
announced it out both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

895
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:27,649
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> they move they have to get that</font>

896
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,170
block back and remember and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what not and</font>

897
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:33,020
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that holes and filters and</font>

898
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,670
whatnot have to turn as well as the

899
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:36,680
routing table itself I would rather

900
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:41,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron just give somebody who multi homes</font>

901
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:43,190
a / 22 / 23 and I can look in Aaron and

902
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,290
find out who it came from where why it's

903
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:47,329
there who owns the route etc etc and

904
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,500
when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> change providers their route</font>

905
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:52,910
doesn't change and I don't have to

906
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:54,770
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> my filters etc so I since</font>

907
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:56,420
everybody's already accepting those sub

908
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:58,369
allocations by your own admission when

909
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:00,680
somebody multi homes I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering what</font>

910
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:02,980
objection there is to giving a micro

911
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:04,520
allocation of a 23 or 22 something

912
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,140
reasonable to somebody who's

913
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:07,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-homing so that we can at least</font>

914
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,890
nail down and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to change our</font>

915
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:11,540
filters every time they move well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

916
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:14,900
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if this is an objection but</font>

917
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,670
certainly if it's assumed in a larger

918
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:18,140
block I can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to the larger</font>

919
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,300
block and still be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there</font>

920
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:22,250
whereas if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an independent</font>

921
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,440
allocation I have to listen to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

922
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:26,270
have a question for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're</font>

923
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,099
only putting what you're putting an

00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,480
entry in for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this block and you know who</font>

925
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:31,130
it's coming from and you never have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

926
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,660
change it how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those are you</font>

927
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:35,660
willing to tolerate into your filters

928
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,879
before your router<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules over actually I</font>

929
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:39,200
just filter on 24's and let anybody

930
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,480
announce anything they want so that's

931
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:45,439
fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but as far as as far as</font>

932
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,240
accepting the larger block then that

933
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,940
implies for instance if Randy gives

934
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:52,040
somebody out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his / 16 or / 12 or</font>

935
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,079
whatever good 24 any punches in his

936
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,670
filter and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening to only the</font>

937
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,380
larger block<font color="#E5E5E5"> than Randy's giving that</font>

938
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,480
guy transit even if he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a better</font>

939
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,010
path through some other provider so we

940
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:02,930
increased performance Brandi doesn't

941
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,880
have to have sorry I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean to use</font>

942
00:45:02,930 --> 00:45:05,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">vario as an example usually picked on at</font>

943
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,450
school and

944
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,450
and you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it by now and</font>

945
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:15,910
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with him being able</font>

946
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:17,710
to deal with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah and and his</font>

947
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:19,509
network is now assuming the entire

948
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,980
burden for that which may or may not be

949
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">what something that he wants but I'd</font>

950
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:24,640
rather the customer get the best

951
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:26,529
possible performance so if he's

952
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,029
multihomed and you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s hops</font>

953
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:30,010
turn me into a s up through somebody

954
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:32,920
else I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go the other way even</font>

955
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:35,440
if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> own the cider okay I have one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

956
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,200
question for you so okay you're saying

957
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,020
that this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be allocations for dual</font>

958
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:44,080
homes yes ma'am okay and and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

959
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:45,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">you define because this is the gist of</font>

960
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,520
this whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

961
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:50,320
define<font color="#CCCCCC"> to home what what what criteria</font>

962
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,450
would you use to determine whether

963
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:56,590
somebody who's dual home gets one or

964
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:58,839
doesn't get one I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually and you</font>

965
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:00,220
know obviously this is sort of off the

966
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,390
cuff so there might be objections and

967
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:03,520
that's when asked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for but i would</font>

968
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:05,680
actually define it as anybody who has

969
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,450
two separate paths<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the internet if</font>

00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:23,170
feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it there's plenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

977
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:24,460
objections in that course Lisa along the

978
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:28,090
people who are single home and things

979
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:30,130
like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least for the that</font>

980
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:31,780
subset of people which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a finite and</font>

00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,760
relatively small subset compared to the

985
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:49,299
say that once you begin doing that then

not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> i p address allocation is an</font>

987
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:57,030
issue then you run out of a s numbers

quickly yeah there's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> 17 million 524</font>

00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:01,300
actually we give them a s numbers

00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,620
whether we give them an allocation or

991
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,050
not if they do they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up strings</font>

992
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:10,580
so running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of a s coverage becomes</font>

993
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:13,430
well it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little higher than the 60</font>

994
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,020
photos not relative to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation</font>

city<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well you're up next anyway</font>

1000
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:30,260
yeah I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say briefly just you know</font>

1001
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:31,670
we hash us over for two hours last night

1002
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:33,980
there's no sense recapitulating the

1003
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:37,490
entire argument Rob<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarkar from Chelsea</font>

1004
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:40,580
did but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a Norfolk up</font>

1005
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:43,009
mark made about charging for space and

1006
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:46,160
that's not what the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument was the</font>

1007
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:49,280
argument was that if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can summarize it</font>

1008
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:51,500
this way decision were clouds<font color="#CCCCCC"> delivery</font>

1009
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">were not a technical decision decisions</font>

1010
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,970
about what<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes listen to our business</font>

1011
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:58,610
decision everyone would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1012
00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:01,790
that they will choose good technical

1013
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:04,610
criteria<font color="#E5E5E5"> e for web apps they listened</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1014
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:06,470
and that management at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the respective</font>

1015
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:09,500
companies will listen to that but the

1016
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:11,149
bottom line is that the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of routes</font>

1017
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,910
and your routing capabilities a finite

1018
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:15,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">resource we can argue about why and how</font>

1019
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:18,319
fast that resource is growing but it is

1020
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,180
finite and at some point you have to

1021
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:21,740
make a decision about how many routes

1022
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:24,049
you can handle which ones you don't

1023
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,279
listen to and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do that</font>

1024
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:28,280
based on what's important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1025
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,060
customers if vario for example decides

1026
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:33,650
that listening<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the / 24 for one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1027
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,180
one of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> crops that we announced as a</font>

1028
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:37,130
backup route if they decide that's not

1029
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,569
important and the connectivity to my

1030
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,400
dialogue customers isn't important

1031
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:42,980
that's a business decision that vario is

1032
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,540
making and we can argue about whether

1033
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:46,280
that's good and bad but you know their

1034
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:48,800
shareholders ultimately will decide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1035
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,960
and their customers will decide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1036
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,320
think the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing here</font>

1037
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:57,290
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really just one of coordination again</font>

1038
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:58,540
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wars expressed Randy</font>

1039
00:48:57,290 --> 00:48:59,950
expressed earlier was that

1040
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,590
the reason that they filter based on

1041
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:04,210
allocation boundaries is to protect

1042
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:06,520
themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> from you know routes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

1043
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:09,370
black cloud and so on and you know

1044
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,670
that's a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be addressed</font>

1045
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:14,290
in other ways whether you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> well you</font>

1046
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:17,040
know for routing registry or what have

1047
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:19,960
you I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have been trying to say</font>

1048
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,640
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with some</font>

1049
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,740
set aside some space for micro

1050
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,080
allocations we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to say let's</font>

1051
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,629
create a coordination mechanism for

1052
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:33,190
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to know what sure the routes</font>

1053
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:35,290
are valid which arm I'd like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1054
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:37,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">something to that I think that uh like</font>

1055
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:38,950
with the micro allocations even the

1056
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:41,380
number of routes that are being

1057
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,660
advertised if someone's Marty<font color="#E5E5E5"> only two</font>

1058
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,430
or three or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks that's that's</font>

1059
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,049
two or three or four paths you know

1060
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,730
three or four or five times in my

1061

routers at the edges of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my network and</font>

00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:52,570
and yeah I am big routers but then again

1063
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:54,630
I have you know hundreds of thousands of

1064

past and<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of my routers today and</font>

1065
00:49:54,630 --> 00:50:00,070
ideally I'd be able to prefix filter in

1066
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:01,780
a domain and not allow someone to

1067
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:04,060
advertise allowed to me that they're not

1068
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,710
the originating PS or somewhere in you

1069
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,870
know a trend today is for that prefix

1070
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,610
and you know the larger the number is a

1071
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:11,859
pass will<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know any any router</font>

00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:13,630
today or you know I've seen a few rather

00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:16,060
than this the you know what they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1098
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:29,899
simple we know that allocations to

for routes we know allocations from

they're not hierarchical and basically

<font color="#E5E5E5">end-all be-all here is that we have to</font>

on the RNA see who have view similar to

00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:04,720
policies are completely separate what

00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:06,190
certain I skis choose to filter does not

of my customer you know connectivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

but they are related filtering policy

I was

1168
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,480
Oh

1169
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:39,520
micro allocation from well what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1170
00:55:37,660 --> 00:55:40,600
to happen to clarify that is they're

<font color="#CCCCCC">going to they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take let's</font>

1172
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,799
have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a downstream ISP and I given</font>

1173
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,840
with class 23 and they go to frontier

1174
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,390
global they're going to announce the 23

1175
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,830
global and I'm going to announce my 20

1176
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:52,359
but their 23 is always going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> link</font>

1177
00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:54,340
this more specific so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

1178
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:56,920
announce my 23 so that it sort of

1179
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:58,420
balances out a little bit and we could

1180
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:02,710
argue the merits of that if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1181
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:05,140
but it does happen i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that the real</font>

1182
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:07,270
thing is is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp that small isp</font>

1183
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that micro allocation would like to have</font>

1184
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:12,790
the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to move or change their</font>

1185
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:14,830
provider without having to go through

1186
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,570
the pain of remembering we're already

1187
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:19,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">pushing the stuff into the wrap table</font>

1188
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:21,310
anyway so does it make that much of a

1189
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:23,620
difference from a routing tables

1190
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:26,290
perspective if we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and do that</font>

1191
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,930
micro allocation the other point and

1192
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll say real quick as far as charging</font>

1193
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:37,270
for route space or charging or some sort

1194
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:38,920
of a settlement system<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love to see</font>

1195
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:42,820
that work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it will</font>

1196
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:46,390
anytime reasonable um the thing there is

1197
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:48,730
is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> macy's wants to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell</font>

1198
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:51,279
those fur coats to somebody sitting in

1199
00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:52,900
Taos New Mexico and Macy wants to be

1200
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:54,190
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to that is P and tiles New</font>

1201
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,190
Mexico so that they can get that

1202
00:56:54,190 --> 00:56:59,410
commerce so one point of it is instead

1203
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:01,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">of charging the edge is P you may</font>

1204
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:04,029
incorporate that into your overhead

1205
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,410
overall cost perspective as far as

1206
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:07,690
giving these smaller routes put out

1207
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:09,250
there and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of coming off the</font>

1208
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:11,290
cuff of that thought I need to be cooked

1209
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,780
more but anyway just as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the route</font>

1210
00:57:11,290 --> 00:57:15,190
table stuff is concerned the ISPs going

1211
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:18,100
to get at least two routes which doctor

1212
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:20,830
in many cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway what is the</font>

1213
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:26,589
allocation policy how to do with respect

1214
00:57:20,830 --> 00:57:31,110
to that well Macy's fur coats are<font color="#E5E5E5"> boning</font>

1215
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:31,110
towels<font color="#E5E5E5"> so get that crap out of town</font>

1216
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:45,689
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> what about it sure I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

1217
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:50,099
sheepish about it um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go</font>

1218
00:57:45,690 --> 00:57:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">down the rat hole of settlements and you</font>

1219
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:58,740
know among the people will do what's

1220
00:57:55,890 --> 00:58:02,490
best<font color="#CCCCCC"> for their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business yes if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its best</font>

1221
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:06,020
from our business<font color="#E5E5E5"> too hey Babette</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> macys</font>

1222
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:09,660
selling fur coats to thousands then

1223
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:11,580
that's life in the big city right um I

1224
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,890
do have what do you want to read a

1225

comment either<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody said I'm Miami</font>

1228
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:23,400
the issue I have with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob filtering is</font>

1229
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:25,740
determining your running into trouble

1230
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,109
with it it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I've had</font>

1231
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:30,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">occasion in the past to have someone</font>

1232
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:32,880
filter out incorrectly but then have a

1233
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:34,910
very tough time determining that this

1234
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,440
was indeed the cause of the trouble and

1235
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:40,230
would be very helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some sort</font>

1236
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:43,349
of policy or place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look up</font>

1237
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:45,960
information to debug such a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and</font>

1238
00:58:43,349 --> 00:58:48,270
I have to fess up i also have a piece of

1239
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,190
email from one of my not people pointing

1240
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:52,080
out that I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> being disingenuous when I</font>

1241
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:55,440
said I didn't know where our policies

1242
00:58:52,080 --> 00:59:02,720
publicly posted I do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not going to</font>

1243
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:02,720
quote URLs here but possibly some<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1244
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:09,560
think a bunch of us would send our URLs

1245
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:13,319
stating our policies or I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would send I</font>

1246
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:15,630
would see that various sent a URL to

1247
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:19,800
where you can find what our current

1248
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:21,660
policy is to manage to put up on an an

1249
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,940
odd collection at something like that

1250
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,339
yeah

1251
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,930
someone actually happy because this is a

1252
00:59:25,339 --> 00:59:33,890
point up there where this there's summat

1253
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:39,169
should be already there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we're how</font>

1254
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:41,259
much you I have a comment one thing that

1255
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:44,030
we try really hard to avoid is

1256
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:48,109
allocating based on people's desire not

1257
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:50,359
to have to redress and I think that I

1258
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:52,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in the room feel</font>

1259
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:55,578
but I have to rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> breast continually</font>

1260
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to apply for those addresses</font>

1261
00:59:55,579 --> 00:59:59,329
for those million cable modems that are

00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:05,150
readjust them continually so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

1264
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i don't know i actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

1265
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:10,280

1266
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:12,760
to redress I know it's difficult but if

1267
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:14,480
we base allocation policies on that then

1268
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:17,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have portable</font>
