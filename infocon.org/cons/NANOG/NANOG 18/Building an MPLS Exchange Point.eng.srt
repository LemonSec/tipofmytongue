00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,309
it's my pleasure to<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce Steve</font>

2
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:18,300
Feldman<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes all right let's see if this</font>

3
00:00:11,309 --> 00:00:19,650
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> works today ooh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all</font>

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,210
right I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to actually talk about</font>

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">something a little different instead of</font>

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,070
my usual may East my West apology speech

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,778
which I'm sure must have you heard a

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,760
couple thousand times already I'm going

9
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:34,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about an experiment that I've</font>

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,340
been trying basically I got the weird

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,969
idea what would happen if we tried to

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">build a exchange point out of mpls</font>

13
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:42,000
prompted of course by some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPLS</font>

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,020
router vendors who said<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be</font>

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,190
really great if people didn't change my

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,899
debt of our equipment instead of what

17
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:52,140
you're using now so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start when we set</font>

18
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,629
a context here this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the results</font>

19
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,530
of some testing I've done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lab</font>

20
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:56,430
unfortunately not nearly enough testing

21
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,590
the lab because you only got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

22
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:59,820
equipment a couple weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago so it'll be</font>

23
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">a whole section at the end of stuff but</font>

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">I still have to explore so please don't</font>

25
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,080
beat me up for the stuff I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

26
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet so much as I didn't want to this is</font>

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,560
kind of a feasibility proof-of-concept

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:12,659
type thing there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was no commitment on</font>

29
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,760
the part of mci worldcom or anybody else

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,950
to make this into a product just setting

31
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,810
that straight up front if it works maybe

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,189
someday yeah great if it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh well</font>

33
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,990
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> testes all of that ok I'll</font>

34
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,860
start with the requirements what we're

35
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,110
trying to do to grow the maze we figure

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,750
we need support for gigabit speeds right

37
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,820
now we can support OC 12c with them

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,579
existing maze we need to know<font color="#E5E5E5"> beyond</font>

39
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,559
that obviously still needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at</font>

40
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,539
layer 2 I don't want to be taking

41
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,930
people's<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp writing tables and screwing</font>

42
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,130
them up and nasty things like that we

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,950
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remote</font>

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,229
connections colocation space especially

45
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,460
our colocation space is finite so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

46
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:57,360
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to support people come</font>

47
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,449
in from other places typical exchange

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,579
point security issues like we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

49
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,439
provider a to dump traffic and provider

50
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,389
be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to happen to feel fitting</font>

51
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,959
maze all the time a point defaulted

52
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:11,599
somebody and screw up everybody else

53
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,930
along with that hold you I can't spell

54
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,670
bandwidth

55
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:22,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">gagement supposed to be management means</font>

56
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,450
that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to preserve the current PVC</font>

57
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,650
like structure of a tma where you can

58
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,459
actually subscribe for a certain amount

59
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">of bandwidth be guaranteed it and be</font>

60
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:36,480
policed on it too<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you can limit</font>

61
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:38,810
how much somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can send you and yes</font>

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,219
to the people who want to be able to do

63
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,939
you be our best effort type stuff yeah

64
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:48,659
that's a requirement to maybe we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

65
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:50,760
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> someday and the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet which we</font>

66
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,280
kind of learned what we know going in

67
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,840
but it but it's been obvious to us we

68
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,340
can't introduce a new technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

69
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,510
trying really really hard to be

70
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,120
interoperable with the stuff we have

71
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,439
there before it's been there before we

72
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't want to make everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can</font>

73
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:09,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">possibly avoid it buy all new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment</font>

74
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:15,599
to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this mpls satisfies one of those</font>

75
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:18,929
requirements let's see a packet over

76
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,099
sonet feature of mpls is nice for us

77
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,540
because it's where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router</font>

78
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,599
manufacturers seem to be devoting most

79
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,108
of their development resources right now

80
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,548
we have OC 48 c<font color="#E5E5E5"> OC 192 even pause today</font>

81
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:31,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">i haven't seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any bit evil live in TM</font>

82
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,859
interface on a router with those fees

83
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:37,909
certain not in general deployment and in

84
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:40,379
my side effect as you lose the cell tax

85
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:41,909
another nice thing about mpls is that

86
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,518
it's a standard that's independent of

87
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,720
the physical medium so in theory at

88
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,909
least you could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enter our</font>

89
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,609
probability again between your paws and

90
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:54,179
your ATM and maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

91
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:55,680
variants maybe even<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 someday so you</font>

92
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,359
could preserve your hardware investment

93
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,919
so after one else pls encapsulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

94
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,560
it but at least it's defined how to do

95
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:04,139
that and yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know there's a package</font>

96
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:08,459
sizes and stuff but let's refer to

97
00:04:04,139 --> 00:04:11,939
further way just to be complete there

98
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,680
are lots of alternatives mpls one of

99
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:17,099
them of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ATM like we're doing</font>

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">today problem with that is nobody like i</font>

101
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:20,789
said nobody's really building higher

102
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:23,099
speed than OC 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> read our interfaces</font>

103
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:25,020
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> celtek still doesn't go away</font>

104
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:25,590
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> slowed and figured out a way to</font>

105
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">make it</font>

106
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:31,049
operate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the existing land</font>

107
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,020
technology frame-relay pretty much the

108
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,240
same set of problems it's nicer in a way

109
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:40,889
that mpls because it's simpler to

110
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,540
configure currently there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3</font>

111
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:43,530
involvement so you don't have to figure

112
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,330
how to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a deal with you writing</font>

113
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:49,080
tables and I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that later and</font>

114
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:52,380
talk and they seem interoperability

115
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,349
issues and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody really did builds</font>

116
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,840
a real fast frame relay switch turns out

117
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,090
you can take some of the existing mpls

118
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,349
LS ours and make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> into frame relay</font>

119
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,299
switches by settings and configuration

120
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:05,400
variables<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't tested that it</font>

121
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,370
probably works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't tried that</font>

122
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,510
yet and of course Gigabit Ethernet with

123
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,550
which a lot of people are doing right

124
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:13,409
now gigabit ethernet is probably the

125
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,200
best choice for an environment where

126
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,340
you're sitting in a large color area and

127
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,130
everybody's running wires across the

128
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">room it's harder if you have to bring in</font>

129
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:23,880
connections remotely especially if you

130
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,750
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> avoid things like net edges in</font>

131
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,969
the middle it's not impossible because

132
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:31,740
you can do things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like run giggy over</font>

133
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,900
dark fiber if you're in an environment

134
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:35,690
where that's one of the worst possible

135
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">to obtain the dark fiber to do that with</font>

136
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:41,310
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bandage bandwidth management stuff</font>

137
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:43,169
and security issues there are enough

138
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,560
hopes now in some of the newer switches

139
00:05:43,169 --> 00:05:48,840
that like you do some security and vlans

140
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,130
and stuff like that that will let you

141
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:52,919
achieve sort of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same kinds of</font>

142
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:55,289
effects as you get now with with ATM so

143
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:59,130
it's less of an issue than it was even a

144
00:05:55,289 --> 00:06:00,000
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago anyway i'm testing mpls so</font>

145
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,880
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about for the</font>

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,260
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this presentation first test</font>

147

was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment i had and just</font>

148
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:12,810
try setting up and pls to make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

149
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:14,849
knew how to do it the test environment

150
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:20,370
here consists of<font color="#E5E5E5"> two juniper and forties</font>

151
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:22,469
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> cisco 75 something with one of</font>

152
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,800
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> m40 set up as the exchange points</font>

153
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:29,789
which and the other two router setup is

154
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,870
customer routers you can't probably see

155
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">them at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom but there are</font>

159
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,650
configuration so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> test was</font>

160
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:43,199
really just to build

161
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,388
LSPs between the two and customer

162
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,639
routers and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could actually</font>

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,780
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did bgp any bgp session</font>

across it and actually for a traffic

165
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,739
across it I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the kind of</font>

166
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,210
thing that sounded obvious like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ought</font>

00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:58,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but had anybody ever tried</font>

168
00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,150
it well I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to try it so this is</font>

169
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring part configuration on the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Juniper appear router basically just set</font>

171
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:08,720
up an LSP to the cisco up here on the

172
00:07:05,729 --> 00:07:11,940
other side with an explicit path and

173
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,310
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned off the constraint based</font>

174
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,120
routing and I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the reason for</font>

175
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,750
that in a moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also turned off</font>

176
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,949
decrement TTL on the grounds that well a

177
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,800
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reasons for that actually Lana</font>

178
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:27,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">will get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into that now one of them is I</font>

179
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that everybody needs to see</font>

180
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,210
what's happening in the middle of an

181
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:32,340
exchange point but the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and perhaps</font>

182
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,198
more important reason is that I don't

183
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">want the routers in the middle of the</font>

184
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,009
exchange point to have defaults or to

185
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,610
carry full bgp tables or anything like

186
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:46,260
that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it did decrement GTL a</font>

187
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:48,120
traceroute the ICMP the TTL expired

188
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,740
would actually never make it back to the

189
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,750
sender because it would never<font color="#CCCCCC"> out so</font>

190
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,000
he'd end up is a missing cop in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

191
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,289
traceroute and that's ugly anyway so

192
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,729
here's an explicit path that goes

193
00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:03,330
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle I exchange router to</font>

194
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:08,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">the far side customer router here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,258
peering session to the other side I

197
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,520
actually did set multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> cop as part of</font>

198
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:15,690
the experimentation and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> never took it</font>

199
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,758
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that still worked and</font>

200
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,289
in fact I imagine it won't for we still

201
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,250
get to again in a moment and the

202
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:26,940
addresses are set to the loop backs on

203
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:29,190
the on both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pier riders on the</font>

204
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,080

<font color="#CCCCCC">Juniper anything here again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use an</font>

207
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:43,289
explicit path going back you notice here

208
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,180
that there is no statement to turn off

209
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:50,290
the constraint based routing and no

210
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,359
statement to turn off the CTL decrement

211
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,680
I wasn't able to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

212
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,870
documentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> any reference to the</font>

213
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,859
capability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that that doesn't mean</font>

214
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:59,980
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there just means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

215
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,050
how to do it but the lack of those

216
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,779
things does cause some problems which

217
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about in a moment and finally</font>

218
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:08,649
here's the configuration of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guy in</font>

219
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,779
the middle all I'm really showing here

220
00:09:08,649 --> 00:09:12,610
is whether this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the site this is a</font>

221
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,800
BGP configuration Francisco same kind of

222
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:17,579
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pointing back tied to Jennifer</font>

223
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,540
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange configuration</font>

224
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:20,769
specifically but there's no bgp

225
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,639
configured on it there's no default

226
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:27,370
route on it all it has is static / 32 s

227
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:31,630
back to the loopback interfaces on the

228
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:33,819
customer writers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so here's what</font>

229
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,130
happened when they did this first

230
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:38,620
problem i ran into the cisco would not

231
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,480
build the LSPs unless I had an igp

232
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,399
turned on it wouldn't work with default

233
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,779
routes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I turned on is is and</font>

234
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything came up like I was supposed</font>

235
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:49,329
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be GP session came up I was actually</font>

236
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,470
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send packets across these things</font>

237
00:09:49,329 --> 00:09:51,910
I didn't show in my diagram by the way

238
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,769
the test host sitting on the sides there

239
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,199
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP routes that are installed</font>

240
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:58,029
and forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all that but anyway I</font>

241
00:09:56,199 --> 00:10:00,279
was able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pass traffic across this</font>

242
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,139
thing it work just fine the only real

243
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:04,600
problem I had was missing hop sorting

244
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:05,860
the trace route because the cisco didn't

245
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:12,579
do the decrement or did the documentary

246
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:15,910
TTL when I didn't want to ok so now

247
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:18,969
comes the more interesting test one of

248
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other constraints of the may service</font>

249
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:26,949
as it is now is we want our customers to

250
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:29,350
be able to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us when they should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

251
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:31,329
able to communicate<font color="#CCCCCC"> with each other it's</font>

252
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,699

256
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:41,620
the 8am thing going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

257
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">something similar here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many for security</font>

258
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,550
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I haven't found a good way yet</font>

259
00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:49,870
with mpls of having a router that's

260
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:53,439
receiving an LSP RCP request to say no I

261
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,310
don't want it so right now best way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

262
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:56,560
have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle that will</font>

263
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,630
do it juniper has a feature called

264
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,540
circuit cross-connect which essentially

265
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:02,680
lets you splice LSPs together so in this

266
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,920
diagram

267
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,449
to customer routers have built LSPs to

268
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lsr any exchange has built</font>

269
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,529
a cross connect between the two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

270
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,029
so it essentially looks like one long

271
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:20,080
LSP but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in the middle</font>

272
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:22,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">of controlling it here's the</font>

273
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:26,800
configuration on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juniper side it's</font>

274
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:30,520
just a simple one hop LSB to the city

276
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:38,760
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> see SPF the magic here is that</font>

277
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:42,910
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the LSB terminates on the</font>

278
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:45,670
exchange router there's no route to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

279
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,899
far end pier so you have to add that by

280
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,660
hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the install statement</font>

281
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:51,550
does you need it need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have rats the</font>

282
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,630
next top or vgp doesn't work so if this

283
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,920
installs that when the LSP comes up

284
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:59,279
similarly on the cisco side pretty much

285
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:05,469
the same magic build a tunnel<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

explicit path that turns out or doesn't

288
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,610
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the case and</font>

289
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:15,490
again I set up a static route pointing

290
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:19,990
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wheel bgp pier pointing to the</font>

291
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:23,740
tunnel so that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp can pick it up as</font>

292
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:27,370
a next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and here's the magic on the</font>

293
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:31,300
exchange router here's building<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

294
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:33,070
connection basically what you're doing

295
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:36,490
is you're splicing together the incoming

296
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,959
connection with the outgoing one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh</font>

297
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is part of it though this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

298
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,880
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I build build the LSP s from</font>

299
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,950
the exchange router to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer</font>

300
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,250
routers and here's the part where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

301
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:49,510
glued them together with the connections

302
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,790
with statements called LSP switch and

303
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:53,260
basically you just tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the name of</font>

304
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:54,730
the incoming LSP and then the outgoing

305
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:56,050
one and it glues them together and you

306
00:12:54,730 --> 00:13:00,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to do it in each direction since</font>

307
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:01,469
LSPs are unidirectional<font color="#CCCCCC"> and here's what</font>

308
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,640
happened when they tried testing it

309
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:07,990
first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happened was my juniper</font>

310
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:09,670
crashed fortunately juniper was giving

311
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,930
us really good support and within<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

312
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:13,469
days they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a new version of code</font>

313
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,329
with their bug fixed

314
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,180
and got it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and running in it</font>

315
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:20,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">immediately worked basically as well as</font>

316
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:24,300
the previous case same set of problems

317
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:29,069
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the GTL document and all that but</font>

318
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:32,250
I'm traffic past vgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> past and it just</font>

319
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,140
did its thing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that showed the circuit</font>

320
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:38,160
cross-connect actually will do what I

321
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,650
wanted to do in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok here are</font>

322
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,780
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things I didn't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the test</font>

323
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:44,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were a few more hundred hours</font>

324
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:47,910
in a day I could have done some of this

325
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:49,079
ATM really would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to make</font>

326
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,350
this work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with our existing IT</font>

327
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:54,210
environment we have some ATM interfaces

328
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,260
on both sets of routers I just never<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font>

329
00:13:54,210 --> 00:14:00,810
a chance to hook them up and see what

330
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:02,910
would happen I do know that this point

331
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:05,760
at least juniper is has a somewhat pre

332
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:08,730
standard ATM implementation so it's not

333
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,000
clear that it would work right today but

334
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,700
will at some point I haven't been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

335
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try it yet with more than two piers</font>

336
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,580
there's no reason why that shouldn't

337
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,720
work but better make sure also haven't

338
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,500
been able to try it yet with more than

339
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,390
one ms are in a car at<font color="#CCCCCC"> this point that</font>

340
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,900
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be not as easy for me to test and</font>

341
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,160
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I only have the two junipers and</font>

342
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,020
Cisco doesn't appear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sec</font>

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">request connect like feature yet at</font>

344
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,970
least again in the documentation that i

345
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:37,590
can find I'd love to test performance

346
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,940
and see if you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pass more</font>

347
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:45,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">than one packet per second like a king</font>

348
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:48,330
does another one problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did run into</font>

349
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,490
was the way I had a configured I ended

350
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:53,970
up setting addresses on each side of the

351
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:57,990
point-to-point circus between the

352
00:14:53,970 --> 00:15:01,140
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> switch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange</font>

353
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,700
router so that consumed up o / 30 for

354
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:04,350
each one of those in addition to the

355
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,930
address that's consumed for the loop

356
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,790
backs let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a way to reduce</font>

357
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:10,920
or eliminate that so we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font>

358
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:12,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">eat up as much address space and</font>

359
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,709
building one of these and you think it

360
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,150
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's much</font>

361
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:17,760
further down the road in my mind at

362
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:21,420
least is building it an exchange where

363
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:24,270
you can actually have LSPs true

364
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,010
interpreter LSPs essentially you they

365
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:26,760
originated somewhere in one providers

366
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,400
backbone interment

367
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,960
someone had a provider's backbone and

368
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,740
they're really we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> passing</font>

369
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:37,770
transparent PVC like things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that case</font>

370
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:40,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">um those are things that I test so</font>

371
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,189
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some preliminary conclusions it's</font>

372
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:46,530
not quite yet ready for prime time

373
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:48,210
mainly because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these little features</font>

374
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:49,949
that aren't quite implemented there or

375
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,740
if they are my didn't find<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in the</font>

376
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">documentation right now the</font>

377
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,520
implementations that are there are tied

378
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,410
really to the application of traffic

379
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,630
engineering which is where the demand is

380
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,130
certainly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able</font>

381
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweak it to make it do what I wanted</font>

382
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,189
was pretty good but there are still a

383
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:08,550
few more knobs needed especially in the

384
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:11,640
cisco side to make really do what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font>

385
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">but it has potential i think all those</font>

386
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,310
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need doing are really just a</font>

387
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,950
matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> of somebody sitting down and</font>

388
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:24,020
writing the code to do it and telling me

389
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:26,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">how it works and it could work so the</font>

390
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,000
results of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> test so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far are qualified</font>

391
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:32,880
success which I think are capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

392
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,920
doing quite a bit better I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

393
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,939
could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quite a viable product of</font>

394
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,360
course like I said I can't guarantee

395
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:42,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll do this at any time but it's nice</font>

396
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know that we could just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

397
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:47,250
words of thanks to Juniper Networks for

398
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,900
lending us the<font color="#CCCCCC"> M 40s and for their</font>

399
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,300
really fast response when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found the</font>

400
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,860
bud with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross connect and also to</font>

401
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,689
cisco systems which offered a lot of

402
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,830
support and offered to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lend us some</font>

403
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:58,500
equipment but it turned out we already

404
00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,560
had what we needed in the lab<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

405
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,510
finally here's my contact information

406
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:07,010
usual this presentation will be up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

407
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:10,430
the web<font color="#CCCCCC"> for tlie after i'm done up here</font>

408
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,430
any questions

409
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:17,990
okay okay

410
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:28,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're your last content slide made the</font>

411
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:30,630
assumption that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls could either be</font>

412
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,520
used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> TE purposes or for the purpose</font>

413
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:37,670
that you were using it why why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you</font>

00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:40,800
call what you were doing te it's really

maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a let's try to put this into</font>

417

words the purpose of traffic engineering

as defined in these implementations

419
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:55,530
right now is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp shortcuts so</font>

420
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,700
within the interior of a providers

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:58,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">network you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get from point A to</font>

point B over a traffic engineer circuit

423
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:03,360
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to do the same thing</font>

424
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:05,610
that's outside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp domain and that's</font>

425
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,320
really where the weeks have to happen is

426
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:13,080
decoupling a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than I GP</font>

427
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:14,580
