00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:11,550
welcome hi good afternoon everyone I'm

service

6
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:25,759
today I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about about</font>

7
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:28,880
project what followed motivations for

8
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:32,590
the RAS and the status<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:36,019
the perfect idea can you hear me<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:38,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> better what motivations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

11
00:00:36,019 --> 00:00:41,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">own motivations and goals of our is</font>

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,400
status of project and prototype that we

13
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,110
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up for this project and some</font>

14
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:48,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting results so far we have seen</font>

15
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:51,290
from the project prototype and the

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:54,530
future developments of our is the

17
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:57,339
motivation well this morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> our most of</font>

18
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:00,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">you seen like how well the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PTP works and</font>

19
00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of everyone trusts everyone</font>

20
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,810
area model and how long we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go ahead</font>

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:08,149
with that stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at it and a lot</font>

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the results with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Craig as shown in</font>

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:12,380
the morning could have been actually

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,960
seen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if this R is worst in place</font>

25
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,649
and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use of have a look at this</font>

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,179
data we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the BGP</font>

27
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,660
announcements are originating from

28
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,670
independent sources and we are at the

29
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,100
farm and networks which are the far away

30
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,290
points can never trace it unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

31
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,419
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the origin from the remote</font>

32
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,340
points that you hear it so you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

33
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,350
follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back and see what was the</font>

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:39,110
problems and why it happened and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

35
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,880
and so on so what essentially this is

36
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,679
going to tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where you would</font>

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,020
have been how or where you would have

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,200
been routed yesterday on the autonomous

39
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,360
system baseless so this will help you to

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,970
check against the policies which are the

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,520
routing registry databases or against

42
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:59,780
what you really wanted is what's going

43
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">on or not so with this we started a goal</font>

44
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we want have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> initially an</font>

45
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:07,158
interactive<font color="#CCCCCC"> cody which is essentially</font>

46
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:09,259
probably a giant looking glass which

47
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,220
cannot send any packets but it has a

48
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:15,470
history of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp updates where you can go</font>

49
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,560
back in time and ask for what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tape</font>

50
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:21,260
state of a routing table from a point<font color="#CCCCCC"> A</font>

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,350
to point<font color="#CCCCCC"> B</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and which is essentially the</font>

52
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:27,739
game is so we provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> any interactive</font>

53
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">tool query which is command line as well</font>

54
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,450
sugar based interface you will also

55
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide raw data who's interested in</font>

56
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,399
that and probably can run it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on other</font>

57
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:40,490
tools or other software which can take

58
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so how do we do it is we want the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">collective default free bgp updates from</font>

62
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:57,620

some of the book possible queries to

you as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the users can ask for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it or we</font>

67
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,160
will discuss it in what can be

<font color="#CCCCCC">Quarian prefix powers a prefix yesterday</font>

71
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:23,090
over a period of time and same goes for

over a period of time and more queries

82
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:53,480
you can request and we will be happy to

83
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:56,210
implement them the project is a very

84
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:00,459
young project we started six months ago

85
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:02,870
of most in<font color="#CCCCCC"> July 1999 we started with a</font>

86
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:06,080
design document which is available on

87
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,330
the left side and then we sometime in

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,940
October<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aoife set up a fast route</font>

89

collector to color the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP updates and</font>

90
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,548
<font color="#CCCCCC">started putting them into database so</font>

91
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,790
now we have around roughly<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 10 years</font>

92
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:22,219
hearing with reproductive and for Rory

93
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:25,300
now we have in the right meeting that 35

94
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,450
you plan to announce this query tool for

95
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">for beta testers and tested we want to</font>

96
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:36,560
set a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> more bgp sessions and in some</font>

97
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:38,960
time may that is 536 into the person we

98
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,300
want her more pious and define well

99
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">formally there how the</font>

100
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:46,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> center phase should look like so for</font>

00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,180
this we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the final set of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what we are planning is at each exchange</font>

103
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:55,000
points you see in the exchange points we

104
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:58,150
put a remote collector which bgp

105
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,060
sessions with all the possible peers out

106
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,609
the which gets a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit btb feed from them</font>

107
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,889
since we cannot be everywhere he also

108
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:08,470
will have some ebgp sessions running

109
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:12,520
from the default free border routers on

110
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:16,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">nsps all this data is collected to write</font>

111
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">NCC sunken collector will have bgp</font>

114
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">inserted in the database where you can</font>

115
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:33,430
create as a command-line interface or a

116
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:36,190
CGI or web forms so how do we collect

117
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:40,330
the data we have autonomous system

118
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:42,280
numbers is 12,000 654 you will appear

119
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">with all the possible peers are in a</font>

120
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:50,020
change point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and few ebgp points plant</font>

121
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:53,590
the initial estimate is to go for say<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

122
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:55,090
such major collectors in the pipe in CC

00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,919
region which is pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,330
openness another four neighboring parts

125
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:05,560
and each exchange we estimate 70<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS or</font>

126
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:08,409
so so each of the son of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PS announcing</font>

127
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:13,990
whole routing table<font color="#CCCCCC"> to up perceivably of</font>

130
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:23,020
was all it does is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> collects bgp for</font>

131
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:26,169
announcements and packed with a sports

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:29,279
and other bgp attributes and time stamp

133
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:32,139
it and save it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fun binary format</font>

134
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,050
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> also take snapshots which is to</font>

135
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,969
create a state of a routing table so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

136
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:40,120
essentially look load is not short and

139
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:51,240
collectors don't announce any routes not

140
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:51,240
forward any traffic it just listens that

141
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,360
so this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the final</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> set final say that</font>

00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,610
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want luck to you and then for that</font>

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,370
whole project to us and so we set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a</font>

145
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:09,940
prototype which is stunning since

146
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">October 1999 so far we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten peers</font>

147
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:15,280
and which is from eight distinct photon

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">immerse systems and the collector we are</font>

149

data<font color="#CCCCCC"> dead end with database and indexes</font>

152
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,520
so that you can cover it send different

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:33,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">queries to it so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the raw data plus</font>

154
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,719
snapshots and the index data comes to

155
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:40,300
roughly forty megabytes per pure per day

156
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,160
it's kind of large amount of data we

157
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:46,000
don't know how how long we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can keep this</font>

158
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:51,130
data online if you plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go for 700</font>

159
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:54,729
years over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the period of time and these</font>

160
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:58,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the rough list of peers we have some</font>

00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:15,880
syndrome you might notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have</font>

167
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:18,130
peering with two locations with the same

168
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,440
autonomous systems which was not

169
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,960
initially what we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of but yeah</font>

170
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,300
after doing this we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we do see</font>

171
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,460
some interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects due to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP</font>

172
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:30,640
mesh and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long it takes to propagate</font>

173
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,140
from one and two other and so that now

174
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,289
so then we said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's an</font>

175
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,750
interesting stuff we should go over and

176
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:39,968
so fix up for our locations we try to

177
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">appear with the same autonomous systems</font>

178
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:42,690
numbers

179
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,200
and then the person w presently develop

180
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,640
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Perl scripts and the CGH face this</font>

181
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,370
roughly look like something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

182
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,339
which will be formally announced at a

183
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:59,830
535 which is in a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of weeks namsun</font>

184
00:08:57,339 --> 00:09:02,170
down let's paly essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> says you can</font>

185
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:05,350
send to type of queries one based on

186
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:08,170
network prefix another one based on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s</font>

187
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,940
origin so where the prefixes origin then

188
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,719
you can specify the time a<font color="#E5E5E5"> period of</font>

189
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:15,600
time which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking for and then</font>

190
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,620
you can either look for all updates

191
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,709
announcements and withdrawals or

192
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,260
individually the last box you see as a

193
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:25,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">PA is a drop-down box which shows the</font>

194
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,020
list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> peers so you can either choose</font>

195

<font color="#E5E5E5">up here and when you enter this as a</font>

198
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,060
which essentially you see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fastest</font>

199
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:43,600
first part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the output is taken from a</font>

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">rip snapshot which shows these other</font>

201
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,250

204
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> staff so each of this updates we</font>

205
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,690
note the prefix in the time at which

206
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:02,829
this was arrived at us in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier from</font>

207
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:05,200
which it was littered the a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s path so</font>

208
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:08,349
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> information is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually possible to</font>

replay<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a sequence some of the tools</font>

210
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,420
like mr t and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp simulation so you</font>

211
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:16,000
can recreate the routing state at any

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,250

214
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,380
this tool is still under development<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

215
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,000
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for feedbacks in fashion</font>

216
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,240
as we announced it or if you have any

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,310
particular interest in to see some data

218
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,079
which lot of the stuff which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Craig</font>

219
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,439
was mentioning could have been actually

220
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:40,000
seen here like the 32nd<font color="#E5E5E5"> roots</font>

221
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,709
announcements and you will see actually

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,260
see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fur there in n factorial</font>

223
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:48,180
problems of that oscillating<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in the</font>

224
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,430
patterns and

225
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:53,640
and what we saw some interesting results

226
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:56,849
from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming this prototype this is</font>

227
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,149
again the what it shows on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one y</font>

228
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:03,240
axis x axis in them till date which is

00:11:00,149 --> 00:11:06,870
running from 15th number till 20th for

00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:10,320
building the y axis<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix updates or</font>

231
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,970
withdrawals so this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

232
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,130
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of years ago the</font>

233
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:17,430
scene was just opposite the patrols was

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,620
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the updates announcements now</font>

235
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:22,170
the scene as<font color="#E5E5E5"> just reverse in Silicon see</font>

236
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,930
everywhere number of patrols is far far

237
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:27,569
less than what has been announced on the

238
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,609
other some of the blocks of quite wider

239
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:32,430
if you notice it that's because the

240
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:34,890
collector was<font color="#CCCCCC"> should shut down for some</font>

241
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:37,649
reasons like software crash hard disk

242
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:39,810
failure or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> example since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

243
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:46,140
are still in and prototype stage we have

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:48,719
some of those<font color="#CCCCCC"> problems to this under</font>

245
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:51,060
father will all be observed is like if

246
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,970
heaps this<font color="#E5E5E5"> period is the second other</font>

247
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,729
graph with a period<font color="#CCCCCC"> is same as that and</font>

248
00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:01,170
the oil axis is number of prefixes we

249
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,940
see so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two the blue one this is two</font>

250
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:06,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty one which i have taken from</font>

Jeff Houston of Telstra and the green

252
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:12,420
one is a strictly clearly which is right

253
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,400
on CC and the red<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is if we take all</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">seven peers which we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have during that</font>

255
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,050

256
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:20,940
prefixes which are announced it's

257
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,520
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> far more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what every</font>

258
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:25,410
individual player can carry but if you

259
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,930
plot all this seven individually what we

260
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,750
see is the difference is minor a couple

261
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:34,319
of thousand of five but collectively the

262
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:37,500
difference is quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> high and for example</font>

263
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know Oregon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root collector today</font>

264
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,660
has something like hundred ten thousand

265
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:44,370
prefixes so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of border</font>

266
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,069
routers out the rich are carrying large

267
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,140
number of the fixes I don't know how

268
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,620
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you have filters like if it is</font>

269
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:56,160
more than 75,000 or some able some

270
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,810
number stop it or things like that this

271
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,930
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something to look at it before doing</font>

272
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,930
that

273
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:07,639
and other is the distribution of number

274
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:09,920
of prefixes for some dimension that it's

275
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:13,490
the maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of prefixes you see /</font>

276
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,699
24 it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than half of it this is</font>

277
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:21,259
taken again overall<font color="#E5E5E5"> of seven peers union</font>

278
00:13:16,699 --> 00:13:24,649
of them so there are most perceived

279
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:28,880
peers out this prefix out the up to / 30

280
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:38,360
and even / 32 other so well this is this

281
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:40,670
interesting thing we saw so they still
