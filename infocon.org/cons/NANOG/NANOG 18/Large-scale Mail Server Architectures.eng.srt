1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:08,729
ok so I'm how<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming loose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:12,269
company called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Blue team you may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:15,450
met yesterday given here i'll talk about

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:20,609
large-scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail architectures so now</font>

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:25,910
we're up<font color="#E5E5E5"> at layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seven but still will</font>

6
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:32,340
be some<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing by large-scale I mean</font>

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:34,559
mail server installations with from a

8
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:41,790
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred thousand users and</font>

9
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:43,440
upwards so basically three feature or

10
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,000
distinguishing distinguished features

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:53,640
from for any kind of ASP application not

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,870
just mail that sets them apart from from

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,539
enterprise systems one is the kind of

14
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:03,390
scalability scalability<font color="#E5E5E5"> require neither</font>

15
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,869
is high availability since these are 24

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:10,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">by 7 systems per definition and the last</font>

17
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:12,960
one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ability to do management on</font>

18
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,380
the system while it's in operation for

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,429
the same reason it's a 24 by 7 system

20
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:24,539
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture you can</font>

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">see I try to illustrate that ok people</font>

22
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,829
know the best practices<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the industry</font>

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,919
is quite advanced on how to build

24
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:35,970
scalable systems scalable web system

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,850
scalable mail systems also have a fair

26
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:42,119
understanding of how to build high level

27
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,070
high availability systems not cheaply

28
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:50,789
but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build them but also</font>

29
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:54,658
extremely low maturity in how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

30
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:57,329
nan actually systems that can be managed

31
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,530
wireless while the traffic wireless

32
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,960
services up and running without

33
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,770
disturbing traffic so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk about</font>

34
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,340
all three of these or talk mostly about

35
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:10,560
well kinda how all about scalability

36
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,769
since that's the most understood of

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,330
these problems

38
00:02:12,769 --> 00:02:19,110
so the challenge here is really to build

39
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:22,200
a scalable hi Val abilities system which

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,819
is not too expensive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is easy to</font>

41
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,379
manage while the system is up and

42
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:32,339
running without disturbing traffic ok

43
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:34,560
the basic we have three base

44
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,510
architectures for<font color="#E5E5E5"> email system one is</font>

45
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,970
the simplest possible one where you have

46
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,629
one mail server either a single

47
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:47,299
processor over multiple with a huge male

48
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:50,429
storage because this system is doesn't

49
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:52,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">first it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't scape what you can't</font>

50
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:55,200
you're comparing a bigger multiprocessor

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,720
about your sooner or later you hit the

52
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,488
hit the roof<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scalability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> none other</font>

53
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,410
serious problem here is of course crash

54
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:07,890
recovery you either need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the journaling</font>

55
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:10,440
file system or something like that to be

56
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,869
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly recover from a cash in a</font>

57
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,739
system<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this so this is quite</font>

58
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,930
uninteresting when we talk about

59
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,880
large-scale systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> next step up is</font>

60
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,609
shared storage architecture what I mean

61
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,700
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have several</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mail servers you</font>

62
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:29,579
spread the load for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic among</font>

63
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,959
them for example by and level 4 switch

64
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:36,840
or even dns round-robin but all all in

65
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 service share the same male</font>

66
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,200
storage so my mailbox can be accessed

67
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:46,440
from any server which is the reason you

68
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:51,418
can use simple load balancing gear in

69
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:54,660
front of it trouble with the with this

70
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:58,680
kind of architecture is is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

71
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:02,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">storage it's what most you see down here</font>

72
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,959
a couple of alternative universe sequel

73
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:09,269
database some fiber channel system and

74
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:11,720
common theme of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that either they</font>

75
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:15,919
don't work very well or a very expensive

76
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:19,918
or they have both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these problems</font>

77
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will focus on is is what</font>

78
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,940
you see at most big ice piece when you

79
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,940
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> remains systems it</font>

80
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,620
distributed storage architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

81
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,800
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail store is partitioned</font>

82
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,949
among a large number of mail servers so

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:37,770
my mailbox resides on a particular

84
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:42,449
subject and can't be accessed at all

85
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:46,320
from another server and in this case the

86
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:50,280
storage can be what she could be local

87
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,169
disk typically it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DBM database</font>

88
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,948
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that berkeley database</font>

89
00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:58,198
database but are another of bunch of

90
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,030
interesting problems in an architecture

91
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,639
like this so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of the slides</font>

92
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,638
vessel discussion will focus on on this

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:11,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so let's start with scalability</font>

94
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,840
this is the first slide again what

95
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:16,139
scalability for architecture like that

96
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,929
is we can divide that into the three

97
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,180
problem areas basically load balancing

98
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,060
and you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I mean with load</font>

99
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:27,210
balancing in this case queuing mail

100
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,970
queuing and message routing for smtp and

101
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:34,049
session routing for either pop or<font color="#E5E5E5"> imap</font>

102
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:36,720
depending on how you read your mail so

103
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,380
start the load balancing when we have an

104
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,750
architecture lipase a balanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> load</font>

105
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:47,340
means that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an even distribution</font>

106
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:49,139
of mailboxes on each server because the

107
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:52,349
number of mailboxes on the server

108
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,810
determines the load<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the server so</font>

109
00:05:52,349 --> 00:05:56,669
load balancing is basically a manual

110
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:00,000
operation of moving mailboxes between

111
00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:04,020
servers man oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> man preferably automatic</font>

112
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,770
in some way and you sure need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

113
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:11,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">for for a number of reasons one is that</font>

114
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:13,639
if your typical eyes PU you go quite

115
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,250
fast so I need to add more servers and

116
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:18,330
then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a rigid</font>

117
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,210
redistribution of your mail accounts

118
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,710
from one one server to the to another

119
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,150
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also you might have customers that</font>

120
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">themselves are going so you have bottle</font>

121
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:33,799
domains that

122
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:36,469
quite fast okay so this is what load

123
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:41,540
balancing a monster in an architectural

124
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:44,810
art is and a naive way of doing for

125
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,490
moving mailboxes would be to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> copy</font>

126
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:50,720
them from the server to another which is

127
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:53,060
of course not working you'll see if this

128
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,410
mailbox is accessed while you do it you

129
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:59,930
risk losing mail so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a simple</font>

130
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:02,030
simple algorithm for doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

131
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:04,790
the task here is to move mailbox from a

132
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:07,369
server a to server be redo is that you

133
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:11,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">first create the new mailbox and lock it</font>

134
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:15,169
and then change the basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

135
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:20,210
routing tables for mail transparent

136
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:21,770
session routing to the new mailbox which

137
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,229
me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one is locked which means</font>

138
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:27,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Pope user cannot access his</font>

139
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:31,909
mail at this point and the smtp incoming

140
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:34,790
inbound mail is cute<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Danny move the</font>

141
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:37,460
contest on all my box<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new and annual</font>

142
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">unload the new mailbox than your up and</font>

143
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:45,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">run so you have a short outage here for</font>

144
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:52,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">four pop users which is how to avoid in</font>

145
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:55,219
in an architect Lucky's ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> next problem</font>

146
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:58,190
which has to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scalability is</font>

147
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,250
one of probably the most serious problem

148
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:05,270
for a large male installation which is

149
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,669
skewing and the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

150
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:11,599
that that suddenly you've got large

151
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:15,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">volumes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a cubed nail mail to queue</font>

152
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:18,140
for some particular domain typically

153
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,910
some big and slow domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are a</font>

154
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:24,469
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you might know could</font>

155
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:28,100
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of courses for that will</font>

156
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,320
happen one is that their mail servers

157
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,680
are down it's impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to connect turn</font>

158
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">narrow is that they you can connect to</font>

159
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,510
them but they just disconnect which

160
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:40,699
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queue it and try</font>

161
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:44,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to resend it yourself later</font>

162
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:46,760
or they can be misconfigured either

163
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,900
because they run some strange mail

164
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:54,530
server software from from some

165
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:56,350
particular wonder or or that I have what

166
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:58,459
what they do basically is that they sent

167
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:01,580
temporary error codes when they mean to

168
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,830
send permanent error codes and temporary

169
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,140
votes means that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queue it in</font>

170
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:09,110
your system and<font color="#CCCCCC"> one other happens you</font>

171
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,120
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get floated by stuff you</font>

172
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,930
have the queue which can happen really

173
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,780
really quick so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very common</font>

174
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:21,229
situation at the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would guess any</font>

175
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:25,280
big ISP and it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be handled and the</font>

176
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:27,590
way to handle that really is to first to

177
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,589
detect the situation very quickly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

178
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:34,100
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an alarm system that</font>

179
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:37,790
actually monitors the queues nothing not

180
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:40,220
only the size of the cubes but also the

181
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:45,069
contents so they can say that whoops now

182
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:48,740
we have grown but very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly and the</font>

183
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:54,350
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are going is that food</font>

184
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:57,340
calm has seventy percent of the males in

185
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:01,280
the queue so what we should do in that

186
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:06,320
situation is somehow to create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new</font>

187
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:10,329
cube for that problematic domain either

188
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:15,500
on if our software allows it on the same

189
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:23,090
host or dedicate a real a machine for a

190
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:26,560
particular domain so that's that's how

191
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,940
it should be handled very often at least

192
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,949
what i have seen it's not a way it's

193
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,950
handled because well

194
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:45,660
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really not supported in quite</font>

195
00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:50,189
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> common solutions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next</font>

196
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:52,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that's that's important for scale</font>

197
00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:55,829
abilities is messed message marketing

198
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,929
and session routing and here the main

199
00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:01,138
issue is actually how to handle virtual

200
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:06,899
domains should have quite a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

201
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:10,259
your own big isp you can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

202
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,509
number of ways one ways to for example

203
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,730
allocate the separate IP address for

204
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:18,689
each word of the main you host which is

205
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,699
probably not a good way to do it because

206
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:26,849
it's not very scalable and it's hard to

207
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:30,299
to maintain sort of the Sun my way of

208
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:34,170
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is to have a particular for</font>

209
00:11:30,299 --> 00:11:38,730
example my you see here my real email

210
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:45,509
address and the ISP rear<font color="#CCCCCC"> ives it either</font>

211
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:49,939
actually rewrite the smtp come on to to

212
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:52,829
my real name or keep that knowledge in

213
00:11:49,939 --> 00:11:56,549
internal instruction system to some

214
00:11:52,829 --> 00:12:00,779
internal address that points to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

215
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:05,579
server male 3 this example where my

216
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:07,679
mailbox resides if we have a rewriting

217
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:11,969
scheme like this we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font>

218
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:15,720
the whole blue tail<font color="#CCCCCC"> bertil domain by</font>

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:19,490
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> reigate matching between between</font>

220
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:23,879
machines rather of course other

221
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:27,029
addressing schemes we can use so example

222
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,949
solve of systems that support is is son

223
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:30,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">may leave the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alias file and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

224
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,979
use the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> for doing stuff like that</font>

225
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's also an alch dropped for</font>

226
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:42,160
four message marketing based on

227
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:46,000
l-dub directors but if you do that for

228
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:48,610
inbound smtp you better do it for pop

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,370
and imap as well otherwise the

230
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:55,720
alternative is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle the</font>

231
00:12:51,370 --> 00:13:00,370
inbound smtp quite well but your pop

232
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:03,130
users are bound to connect directly to

233
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:05,740
the mail server that the pop server

234
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:07,900
where their mailbox is residing which is

235
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,550
not at all a good solution for<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

236
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:14,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">reasons one the most</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

237
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:16,740
that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very hard to to re relocate</font>

238
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,300
that mailbox because it would require

239
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:25,780
changing client software which is a bad

240
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:28,449
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so typically end</font>

241
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,640
up with a architecture like this that

242
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,010
you have a two layer architecture the

243
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:36,580
bottom layer here is the actual mail

244
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:39,460
servers but that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end point mail</font>

245
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:42,790
servers and the first layer the two

246
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:48,270
machines up here are that's a real a hub

247
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:51,280
basically which where you do routing and

248
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:53,650
also hooking all kinds of spam filtering

249
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:59,760
you want to do bodies checking stuff

250
00:13:53,650 --> 00:14:03,910
like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the the the the</font>

251
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,790
address you publish in DNS so the MX

252
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:10,870
records for for all bottle domains point

253
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:13,569
to the routing hosts here one good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

254
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:17,920
without is that the IP addresses of the

255
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:20,650
the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer mail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> servers here are</font>

256
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,870
not visible we need not be visible on

257
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet so you can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run</font>

258
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:31,529
this on a private network behind the the

259
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:34,199
robbing houses<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

260
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,540
this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> common I mean most most</font>

261
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:39,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">lice big guys peace have something</font>

262
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:45,410
similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> rat okay then you also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

263
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:50,550
to handle both both outbound smtp and

264
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:54,870
pop/imap in a similar way so you see

265
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:58,279
here what we what should do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that case</font>

266
00:14:54,870 --> 00:15:01,199
is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to extend the</font>

267
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,769
responsibility of this routing layer the

268
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:07,709
first topmost layer to also handle

269
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:14,579
directly handle outbound smtp and pop

270
00:15:07,709 --> 00:15:18,059
proud can I map rally which<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture</font>

271
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:20,430
illustrates the Pope client goes not it

272
00:15:18,059 --> 00:15:24,139
goes with one level of interaction as

273
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:26,819
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly as the inbound smtp</font>

274
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:29,939
outbound smtp you connect your

275
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:34,079
smtpclient to their to the message

276
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:35,969
routers and they decide what to do and

277
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,839
then of course they have to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

278
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:41,879
your client is to be considered to

279
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:48,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">belong to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the local domains you can</font>

280
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:50,850
relay from from that client so here you

281
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:54,420
end up with an architecture basically

282
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:57,360
where you do all message routing or pop

283
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:59,399
IMAP routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> or spam filtering in the</font>

284
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:03,000
first layer and the second layer is

285
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:06,540
basically reduced to two pop servers I'm

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:09,470
observers and local delivery so you

287
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:12,660
don't even need to run an full-blown

288
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:16,709
empty a like somewhere in the second

289
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,740
year here so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of the</font>

290
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:22,258
state-of-the-art<font color="#E5E5E5"> scalable mail</font>

291
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,149
architecture there is the one big

292
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:28,589
advantage disadvantage with its

293
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:32,429
architecture and that is that each tier

294
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:37,390
tier<font color="#CCCCCC"> two server here is singing point of</font>

296
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:45,280
wipe out the entire service but if one

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:19,219
can reconfigure it in a running system
