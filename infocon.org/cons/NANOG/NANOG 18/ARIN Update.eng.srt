60
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:25,190
in mind that those 96 / 24 s were

61
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:26,570
contiguous with the previous allocation

62
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:34,070
so that puts them back on the bit

63
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:36,640
boundary this next slide shows you how

64
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:41,540
much ipv4 space was issued by Aaron in

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:45,980
1998 1999 measured in /<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-fours in</font>

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:35,420
global and local visual registry

217
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,310
policies but but to do that you really

218
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to be involved I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,130
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you all keep yourselves aware</font>

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:46,700
and understand what's going on with with

221
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:49,640
IP in the future and it'll benefit all
