1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,770
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pleasure to introduce my</font>

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:10,019
colleague sue Harris good morning this

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,940
is up just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a minute I don't stand in</font>

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:17,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">front of Mike's very well so sue how am</font>

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:22,619
i doing I got fat no yes the green

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:26,730
lights on can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear me okay um this</font>

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,619
is a quick look at a global<font color="#CCCCCC"> community's</font>

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,289
draft that I cool it with a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,489
people I really think the credit goes to

10
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,079
the other people in some of the

11
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:39,750
paperwork goes to me let's go through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

12
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,590
fairly quickly this is an addition of

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,820
global bgp communities this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp</font>

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but i think i'll go back and make</font>

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:50,610
sure everybody's heard the community

16
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:53,129
jargon which is bgp communities they

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,079
call her out you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what was first</font>

18
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,320
proposed by anchor chin as he did some

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,460
work with MCI and now it's used

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,100
throughout the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in various</font>

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,860
places to<font color="#E5E5E5"> color out some simplify policy</font>

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,409
you can add delete communities and they

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,810
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have local suit local influence</font>

24
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,330
between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a esas and the ass hack is</font>

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,830
actually used beyond two hops it's not

26
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:18,270
really guaranteed because you can add

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:20,729
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> delete so this proposal suggests to</font>

28
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,408
globally defined communities it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp</font>

29
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,420
which means best common practice

30
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:28,080
suggestion and can be done with the

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,939
cisco route maps at this time juniper is

32
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,310
implemented some of the functionality

33
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:36,229
and denting with evidence is upcoming

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,310
versions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get is you say okay I</font>

35
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,610
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> him to the rest of the people</font>

36
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:44,130
avoid me<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to put that in or</font>

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,590
prefer me and what happens with avoid me

38
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,780
is a cisco route map<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's a local</font>

39
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,659
preference to a very low value and you

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,369
go out prefer me sits the low preference

41
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,869
to a high value and that's something you

42
00:01:53,369 --> 00:02:01,530
take care you'd be a part of your policy

43
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:03,689
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this has been discussed on</font>

44
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,829
the ID our mailing list for people who

45
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,559
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the ID</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your mailing</font>

46
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,840
list it's the eye dr<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter-domain</font>

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,670
routing working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and that</font>

48
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,300
discusses bgp issues

49
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,130
and some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the feedback I've got and</font>

50
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,080
the reason I'm sitting here this morning

51
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,180
is I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear feedback on people's</font>

52
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,150
ideas whether this is a good idea urn or

53
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">a bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea I've talked to lots of people</font>

54
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:28,560
some people say they they really like

55
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,020
this because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a good way to</font>

56
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,910
handle this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very problem where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,920
influence policy two or three hops away

58
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,560
some people say they'd really like to

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,929
bring back something besides community

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,690
because their current policy with

61
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,160
communities is so baked in so even

62
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,859
though it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really morning what I'd</font>

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">really like is to have comments on this</font>

64
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,420
I don't know if I can wake you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all up</font>

65
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,220
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for comments but if not if</font>

66
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,079
you'd send comments to the idea or<font color="#E5E5E5"> list</font>

67
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:57,030
what we're really looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

68
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,989
comments on it so we either send it

69
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,090
forward as 90<font color="#E5E5E5"> or draft it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp and</font>

70
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:05,519
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing BCPs in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because there</font>

71
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,090
isn't any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other location for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PC piece of</font>

72
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,590
these questions on this comments people

73
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:14,130
who looked at the drift I got a

74
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,530
wonderful draft here where I gotta

75
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,799
comments Nate I do recommend if you read

76
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,359
the draft to actually send the editors

77
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:23,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> author's comments we'd love it we'd</font>

78
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,180
like to actually go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on with the version</font>

79
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:35,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that sort of proposed it for ID are</font>

80
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:37,019
looking regret<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes go ahead yep I think</font>

81
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,930
this has I'm Alex blind concentric

82
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,850
network this has two main problems

83
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,670
problem number one is a very practical

84
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:47,060
problem which is that current<font color="#E5E5E5"> vendor</font>

85
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:49,500
handling of communities is very basic

86
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,750
suddenly the way Cisco operates route

87
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,810
maps mean that if you have n orthogonal

88
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,900
sets of communities you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically need X</font>

89
00:03:54,810 --> 00:04:02,220
to the N set of router nap statements to

90
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,109
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> and properly which is a bad the</font>

91
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,970
second problem that I have with this is

92
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,190
a general concept is this lets people

93
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,660
who are downstream from me and maybe

94
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:11,940
downstream from downstream from

95
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,980
downstream of me in<font color="#CCCCCC"> influenced my</font>

96
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,720
routing policy and I may well not want

97
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:19,060
them to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to influence my ratting</font>

98
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,130
policy and

99
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:25,030
if you if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to let them do</font>

100
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:27,190
that you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more complex</font>

101
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:29,169
and difficult to implement manners of

102
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:30,669
stopping them do that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually want</font>

103
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">to enforce my rocking policy on my</font>

104
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:39,849
customers okay but can<font color="#CCCCCC"> I ask a couple</font>

105
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:41,169
questions in response in it if we didn't

106
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,030
have the implementation problem with

107
00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:46,659
cisco which was noted by some other

108
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:50,109
people at talk to if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually had</font>

109
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,060
flexible better flexible route mix would

110
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,190
this be a reasonable thing I mean I need

111
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:56,770
to separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and you're saying yes</font>

112
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:58,180
or no on that I heard no because you

113
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:02,409
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone to influence your</font>

114
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:04,810
policy down the road at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it</font>

115
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:08,650
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a reasonable thing for people</font>

116
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:11,530
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to pass up the the transit</font>

117
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:14,229
change their wishes is to the way in

118
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:16,000
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> things get routed but you need to</font>

119
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:19,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to have some form of more</font>

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,060
complex and policy control at the top

121
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,669
and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to process those wishes</font>

122
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,050
with your policy and basically you end

123
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,549
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in preventing pearl in your router</font>

124
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:32,200
which I'm not convinced as a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

125
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:36,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and apush Barry I don't think I'd</font>

126
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,620
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use / alex i think another way</font>

127
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:42,630
and ask your way of looking at the

128
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:46,330
problem out how and raises is the

129
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:50,320
vulnerability security attack he's not

130
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:52,719
trivial let's remember we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

131
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,940
authentication of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp announcements okay</font>

132
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,630
yeah and there's that whole weakest area

133
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,430
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hesitant to go too far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into this</font>

134
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,190
considering a result of Steve's talk

135
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:08,440
yesterday okay that was a joke<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

136
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:09,910
supposed to laugh and sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric rise</font>

137
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,760
the case may I think that was posed to

138
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,560
crying um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know people know but</font>

139
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,659
within a half an hour of Steve buildings

140
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,000
talk on coordinated denial of service

141
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:22,330
attacks yahoo was brought down by one um

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,970
and and your first bullet up there the I

143
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,729
drwg mostly in favor what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

144
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,120
say is it's the most polite I've ever

145
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,340
seen

146
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,340
