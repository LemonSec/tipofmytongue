1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:09,059
this presentation is about anybody

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,040
everybody hear me yep good this is this

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,690
presentation is about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> death plastic</font>

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,700
measurements project we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a</font>

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,250
drive for the last three years and are

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,259
we now going from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a experimental state</font>

7
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:24,480
into a service that can be offered to

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,029
anybody's who is interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay on the</font>

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,070
slide you see the URL of the of the

10
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,948
project and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're following this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,950
URL after of the transparencies I mind

<font color="#E5E5E5">you there's a underscore between the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o2</font>

14
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:45,390
nanog so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to show you the</font>

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">next 30 minutes or so Oh games working</font>

16
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,690
on the introduction now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll tell you a</font>

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,050
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our goals of the projects</font>

18
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,030
next<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the implementation because</font>

19
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,769
if you have implemented the thing you

20
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,090
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop services and products of</font>

21
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,239
people can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually use in day-to-day</font>

22
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:07,650
operation shows show a few examples of

23
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:09,539
those around with conclusions so what do

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,909
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do well the goal of the</font>

25
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,220
project cost read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was it is to</font>

26
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,619
determine inter provider quality

27
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,408
parameters and so far we've been

28
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,720
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on three first one is delay</font>

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,950
which is the time for packets to travel

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:29,548
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the source so nice be somewhere or</font>

31
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">users a nice piece number two it's this</font>

32
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,829
nation related to that one is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet</font>

33
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,979
loss rate and it's a fraction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of packets</font>

34
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,350
that send out but never arrives third

35
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:42,329
one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing that's the paths</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

36
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,220
the packet takes from source to

37
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,779
destination at the IP address novel

38
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">fortran our lists but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's something</font>

39
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,890
we haven't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looked into its</font>

40
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,780
bandwidth which is the amount of data

41
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,470
per unit of time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can send from</font>

00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:06,520
other design parameters<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we since</font>

44
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,220
we're an organization of of is peace we

45
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,530
want to limit us to entice be traffic

only<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't mean that the techniques</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">young</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your our networks things they can</font>

50
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,810
it's just that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it next thing</font>

51
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,730
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we wanted to do active</font>

52
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,849
measurements where we actually control

53
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:30,880
and generate our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> test traffic that</font>

54
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:33,459
way we're certain what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> standing</font>

55
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:37,030
and we also avoid all private privacy

56
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:41,049
issues related to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do spying on</font>

57
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:43,209
packets that happen to pass by we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

58
00:02:41,049 --> 00:02:45,790
want to do this one way so we measure

59
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,830
from a source to a destination and not a

60
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:50,500
ping like thing from source destination

61
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,120
and back and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason for that is that</font>

62
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,090
a lot there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> h symmetric</font>

63
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,489
routing and asymmetric<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipments and if</font>

64
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:59,620
you do one way measurements you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

65
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:02,100
know what you're measuring and<font color="#CCCCCC"> two way</font>

66
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:05,019
you can always get back to just add<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

67
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">the results</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get from to measuring</font>

68
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:12,250
from A to B and you add up the results

69
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:14,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">you get from measuring from B to a since</font>

70
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:17,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> control and we want to</font>

71
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:19,480
be sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right thing</font>

72
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,829
and people aren't fiddling with our

73
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,950
equipment we have an independent

74
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:26,170
platform for doing our measurements it

75
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:28,238
has to be well controlled and since this

76
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:30,190
shows results about how good people's

77
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,069
networks are just to be well controlled

78
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,100
scientifically available and of course

79
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:38,138
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're not alone on desserts so we'll</font>

80
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:43,340
follow the developments RFC's and

81
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:46,200
internet-drafts so

82
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:50,790
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do these measurements well on</font>

83
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,319
the slide you see the typical situation

84
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:54,900
you have to ice<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace let's call them a</font>

85
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,679
and B to each have their internal

86
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,230
networks shown here in green somehow

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,269
they're connected up to a border router

88
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:05,159
then there's the red connection which

89
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:08,459
can be a direct line or can go to

90
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:12,629
multiple people and you go to the other

91
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:15,239
guy what we do is we install so-called

92
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:18,238
test boxes and those are shown here in

93
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,070
orange at both eyes<font color="#CCCCCC"> peace the boxes are</font>

94
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,599
connected to a part of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the border</font>

95
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:28,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">outer save GPS clock and I'll still show</font>

96
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:32,300
you in a minute why that's needed and

97
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:35,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we have two of these boxes and</font>

98
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">then we can do measurements and</font>

99
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,229
basically here as you delay by sending

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,780
packets from the box at a to the boxes

101
00:04:40,229 --> 00:04:45,508
be and here you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why we</font>

102
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,489
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPS focuses it's one way you have</font>

103
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:49,470
to be sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the clocks are</font>

104
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:54,000
synchronized and synchronization<font color="#CCCCCC"> is B</font>

105
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,699
has to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> independent of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and</font>

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,300
of course if you count the packets send

107
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:02,070
sent from a and you can't compare it

108
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,229
against the packets that never arrived

109
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:07,409
would be you can you can determine the

110
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:11,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">loss get routing you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> straight shirt and</font>

111
00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:13,409
this whole setup is symmetric so the box

112
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:17,039
at a is not only sending packets to be

113
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:20,610
it's also receiving packets sent by the

114
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:25,830
box at<font color="#CCCCCC"> B and you continue like that you</font>

115
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:29,039
create a whole mesh so what do these

116
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:34,469
tests boxes look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's a it's a</font>

117
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:37,919
wreck on<font color="#CCCCCC"> pc pending 219 233 some memory</font>

118
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:41,099
a bit of disk space and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even though</font>

119

120
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:46,620
the machine these days we still have

121
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,039
something like ninety-five percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

123
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,990
fork GPS log books at satellites in the

124
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,710
sky so it needs an antenna

125
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:01,970
up until now we have had a clock which

126
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,638
was mounted in the back of the unit

127
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,889
which meant that we had to run expensive

128
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,620
coax cable from a computer room to the

129
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:13,430
roof of the of the ISP which was

130
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:17,900
complicated and sometimes that even

131
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:19,130
possible in the news we're now moving to

132

as a black box from the NCC so besides

participating in the project just have

145
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,200
these boxes they put it in Iraq say

146
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:05,960
connected to internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 220 switch it</font>

147
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,430
on and that's must they ever to do

148
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,200
except that we occasionally have to ask

149
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,200
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to press the reset button to her</font>

150
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,979
so

151
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:18,599
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS quartets in the back of</font>

152
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,068
the current boxes and actually I'm

153
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:22,469
pretty proud of it since this was the

154
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:26,879
first prototype and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw them together</font>

155
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:29,330
myself and nowadays is just a simple

156
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:35,729
plastic dish which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on on top of</font>

157
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:39,748
your site where this box is located well

158
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:43,709
we have 43 boxes at<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice piece as of</font>

159
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:46,139
februari first at the moment some 35 of

160
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:48,089
them are taking data give your hardware

161
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:51,539
problems there's a box box is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still</font>

162
00:07:48,089 --> 00:07:53,909
being installed and on the left side of

163
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,938
<font color="#E5E5E5">looks like you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see the Glitzi globe and</font>

164
00:07:53,909 --> 00:08:01,289
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red dots indicates where the boxes</font>

165
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:03,990
are and ok we just produces globe and

166
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:06,740
now it's already outdated since for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

167
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:08,879
next for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> folk I have to make a</font>

168
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:10,349
picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the back of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the earth as well</font>

169
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,800
since we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> install the Box in New</font>

170
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:16,438
Zealand so we have 43 boxes at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

171
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,819
moment and we plan to double that in the

172
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:24,229
course of two thousands well well and

173
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,229
i'll tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how in a few slides</font>

174
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:35,579
so now you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have this box is doing</font>

175
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,760
measurements and what do you get for

176
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:42,419
operational use well the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing you</font>

177
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:45,899
get is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the simplest thing is to it's the</font>

178
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:49,800
raw data if you have a box you get all

179
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:55,110
the data that's sensed by the box at

180
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:58,620
your site or<font color="#CCCCCC"> received by it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font>

181
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:00,120
it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want a</font>

182
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,760
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of course we have some data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discs</font>

183
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,190
cultural policies in place since the

184
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,920
data that you get gets with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> box also</font>

185
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,870
tells you something about networks which

186
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,060
data is traveling and you can misuse

187
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:17,819
that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in versa this isn't that</font>

188
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:21,180
interesting so we'll provide also

189
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:22,889
provides lots of network delays and

190
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,219
losses and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show an example in a</font>

191
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:28,260
slight or two we have their outing

192
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,360
vectors<font color="#E5E5E5"> will you frequently the trade</font>

193
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,180
routes that tells how exactly how you

194
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,690
get from the box from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source box to</font>

195
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">the target box those are sort of the</font>

196
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:41,970
basic metrics you can do and the next

197
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing we're working on our garage</font>

198
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:48,980
metrics and we have networks alarming

199
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,449
that alarms in places about two months

200
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,920
we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on summary possible</font>

201
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:55,620
planning purposes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show an</font>

202
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,490
example of that we plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that</font>

203
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:01,050
fully operational by April and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

204
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,269
network performance course that's

205
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:05,819
basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next stamp and that should</font>

206
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,920
be should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be there by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about you and of</font>

207
00:10:05,819 --> 00:10:09,870
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot of in a lot more in</font>

208
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,229
the data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've always interested in</font>

209
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:19,830
hearing suggestions of some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font>

210
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:25,710
to do something with the data right

211
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:28,160
so if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> half a box you'll get</font>

212
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:31,230
access to web page that looks like this

213
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially along the left side you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

214
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:37,550
column which starts with<font color="#E5E5E5"> GT 0 1 which is</font>

215
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:40,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the first box and then goes goes down</font>

216
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:44,189
all the other boxes that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source</font>

217
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:47,250
and on the right hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> side you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a row</font>

218
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:49,860
of targets and if you click<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a random</font>

219
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:54,450
combination you'll see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

220
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:57,060
looks like this which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> performance</font>

221
00:10:54,450 --> 00:11:01,920
of a fairly good connection we found<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

222
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:04,949
ads for pots in here top left is the

223
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,099
delay we<font color="#E5E5E5"> measured as a function of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

224
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:13,020
of day so this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the spot was</font>

225
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:15,570
generated on March 31st of last year so

226
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:20,010
it covers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 24 hours just before that</font>

227
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:22,140
and you see that so it's been tied to

228
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:26,990
midnight and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the delays were</font>

229
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:30,030
fairly constant top right is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

230
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:32,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution of the delay so it's all</font>

231
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:36,089
all the data points we had during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

232
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:40,500
24-hour periods bins and shown as

00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,970
distribution bottom bottom left is and

234
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:47,400
status and control button it won't

235
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:50,100
discuss debts and bottom right is about

236
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,670
showing the package that arrived and you

237
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,530
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but since</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all bots green</font>

238
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:59,250
every fact that we sent along this

239
00:11:55,530 --> 00:12:01,380
connection actually arrived well this

240
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:06,270
was it was a good example we also found

241
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:11,520
bad examples on that and here's one so

242
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:13,410
again you have top left that's the lace

243
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,960
as function of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time you see that it's</font>

244
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:20,380
well except for for a brief period from

245
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:27,210
minus 19 2 minus 15 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corresponds</font>

246
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:30,040
to five to nine in the morning delays

247
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:34,030
fluctuated sort of scattered all over

248
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">the place and what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also see is that</font>

249
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:40,420
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom right you have to the plot</font>

250
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,310
that shows packet losses and you see

251
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,349
that from nine o'clock in the morning

252
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:49,260
packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> losses for this connection</font>

253
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,260
started to go up up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty percent</font>

254
00:12:53,649 --> 00:13:00,369
you can also do is quick we do take a

255
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:04,269
query our database with with writing

256
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:09,939
vectors and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bathroom for</font>

257
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:12,550
long walks another and changes in indy

258
00:13:09,939 --> 00:13:14,709
started practice often explained change

259
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,628
the delays which you quite frequently

260
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:21,878
see is that the delay is constant and

261
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:24,160
then there's a sudden jump and if you go

262
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:28,480
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the to the IP address level it's</font>

263
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:33,399
usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> related to a router being added</font>

264
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:35,949
or bad better changed and on the bottom

265
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:38,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just she see an example which</font>

266
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:41,498
actually gets by requiring our database

267
00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:45,399
so january twenty nine with the

268
00:13:41,499 --> 00:13:47,589
connection with nine hubs and the words

269
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,660
and on favorite treat the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

270
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:51,850
suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone up and he then look at</font>

271
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">trade shots you see that the resnet shop</font>

272
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,949
introduced and the part is slightly

273
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:55,949
different

274
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:05,429
and that brings me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> my next point so</font>

275
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,989
called delay alarm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it's it's nice</font>

276
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:09,449
to see these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pots of delays but that's</font>

277
00:14:06,989 --> 00:14:12,569
yesterday's data it has some interest it

278
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:14,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">has some interested you also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

279
00:14:12,569 --> 00:14:17,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">know when something goes wrong and</font>

packets are completely lost or delay

281
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:24,779
suddenly go up and delays one of the

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,730
it's taken<font color="#CCCCCC"> system back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route and so</font>

285
00:14:33,869 --> 00:14:39,649
that's that's why we have developed in

286
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:42,540
the alarm and that's shown in this slide

287
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:46,910
should start by looking at the left pots

288
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:50,420
you see the delay for 24-hour periods

289
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:54,420
and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look just above the red error</font>

290
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:56,040
arrow you see this on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jump and this</font>

291
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,149
is minus 20 so that's four in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

292
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,040
morning and this is a performant change

293
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:05,730
of course we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in control the</font>

294
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">network's so we don't know what happens</font>

295
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,639
but if you're hosting a box you probably

296
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:16,429
like to know that something broke or

297
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:20,249
sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> Edison getting a lot slower then</font>

298
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:24,269
we also you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> see some see a big sort</font>

299
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">of from here that's facing the peak</font>

300
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:29,009
shown in between the green bars and

301
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,360
that's not an alarm that's something

302
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,329
where people come in since<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

303
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,519
corresponds to 29 in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 25 the</font>

305
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:40,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the time that users of the</font>

307
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,959
on and on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link and this</font>

308
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:48,119
increasing to delays and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the alarm that</font>

309
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:51,118
we have will trigger on these sudden

310
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:55,410
gems but it won't trigger on on day

311
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:59,480
night effects and and other usage

312
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,480
patterns that we can sort of predict

313
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:05,720
so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we do it we basically</font>

314
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,390
calculate medium and percent or delays

315
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:11,930
and we compared it against the previous

316
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:15,319
days and as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> ninety-five percent</font>

317
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:18,859
of the delays are outside the expected

00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:21,500

324
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:41,240
setting the alarm we also clear it if

the unusual condition disappears at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

15 minutes this is something something

329
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:53,510
we can still June we can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as</font>

330
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,819
short as you as you like but the

331
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:59,450
consequence of this is that you'll get

332
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:06,080
more false alarms so it's tunable but at

333
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:10,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">your own risk so it's just the typical</font>

337
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:22,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a half four months what we typically</font>

338
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:28,369
see is that there are six alarm set

339
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:30,350
messages for each box each day most of

340
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:33,560
them if we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually real effect so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

342
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:41,810
little statistical fluke we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

contact with the decides that actually

344
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:48,590
get the alarms get some feedback if what

345
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:52,040
we saw actually correlated with Darren

347
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,240
people seem to like this more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

348
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting angry customers on the phone</font>

349
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,510
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> neta so slow and like I said</font>

350
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,080
this is tool to detect<font color="#CCCCCC"> short-term</font>

network performance

352
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:14,668
so what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term then well get a</font>

353
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:18,419
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask is how do the</font>

354
00:18:14,669 --> 00:18:21,419
lace develop over time in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

355
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:23,279
gets lower and if it gets slower how

356
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:28,409
fast is it gets lower and when should

357
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:32,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">you buy more bandwidth this is typically</font>

358
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:34,919
things that develop over months to do

359
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,299
half a year or a year and at that point

360
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">it becomes hard to look at all the</font>

361
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:41,639
individual measurements since you have

362
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:43,470
hundreds of thousands<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data points you</font>

363
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:47,728
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make up lots</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that takes a</font>

364
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:49,440
few minutes you see that it's you see

365
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:50,999
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you wanted so</font>

366
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,129
you feel a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit with your script</font>

367
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:56,460
your own it again you wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> for five</font>

368
00:18:53,129 --> 00:19:00,359
minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's yeah after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two or</font>

369
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:04,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">three cycles you're just bored so what</font>

370
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:07,619
we do then is summarized the thing we

371
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:10,738
summarize the data for six hour

372
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:12,809
intervals in percentiles and we define

373
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:17,179
three percentiles the two and a half

374
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:21,330
percent percentile so that's the lowest

375
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:25,049
the delay corresponding to two<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

376
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:27,299
half percent of the measurements this is

377
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:30,029
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best case and it's roughly</font>

378
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:33,269
roughly equal to the line speeds between

379
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:35,849
source and destination we also

380
00:19:33,269 --> 00:19:39,929
calculates the fifty percent over the

381
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:43,889
median which is sort of what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average</font>

382
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:45,840
user will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see and the 97 a half</font>

383
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:50,008
percentile which is the worst case over

384
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:56,759
a day now if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this okay you reduce</font>

385
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:59,690
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 numbers for per day</font>

386
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,309
or still handful for each<font color="#E5E5E5"> month and</font>

387
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:05,330
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are things you can eat them much</font>

388
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:05,330
easier play with

389
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,679
so what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the moment is</font>

390
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:14,320
actually plot them over time and this is

391
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,389
the behavior medium behave you see for

392
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,120
one of the connections amount of October

393
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:25,199
and so he had the pot has to be polished

394
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">up a bit but basically the x-axis is</font>

395
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,450
unix time and on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see in rats the</font>

396
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:35,019
days so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts at the global force in</font>

397
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:39,549
the dental and from the 31st on the

<font color="#E5E5E5">y-axis you see the delay and the for the</font>

black red green and blue points

400
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:49,360
corresponds to the various intervals of

401
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:52,870
the day and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see here is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">starts network around fine on october</font>

407
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:11,830
it was a usual network condition that

408

that continued for until the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

417
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:44,019
him and ask him what happens so these

418
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:47,139
are here you can also look at this in a

419

projection and then of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see</font>

two peaks and the side just providing

the plots for first typical side we

00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:08,900
we just happen to be so the behavior is

426
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:15,920
more or less constant over

427
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:19,520
periods of all months next thing is its

428
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,260
network performance course well why do

429
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to do it is well if you have a</font>

430
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,910
test box at your sides and there are

431
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,760
hundreds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them elsewhere in the world</font>

432
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:32,330
needs to give 200 connect connections

433
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:35,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">unless you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at 200 plots and</font>

434
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:38,510
we have several parts so it's a big pile

435
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:42,160
of paper and if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

436
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:45,830
on a daily basis it's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> work and</font>

437
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:47,630
if you give this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your manager he's</font>

438
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:49,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably bored after looking at the</font>

439
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,550
first two parts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he just said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

440
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:56,149
what's summary so we'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> create one</font>

441
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:58,610
number so we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a score</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">network scoring method for network</font>

443
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:03,050
connections when we've artificially sets

444
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:05,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you have a perfect connection will</font>

445
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:10,129
give you score for thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and perfect</font>

446
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,440
means no packet loss minimal delay that

447
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:14,450
is given the distance between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> boxes</font>

448
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:17,870
of usually cannot go any faster than

<font color="#E5E5E5">speed of lights and a little variation</font>

450
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:27,020
in the delays so day or night the DA's

451
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,439
are about the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> any network is it</font>

452
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:32,270
just congested and of course he also to

453
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,860
score zero which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is no</font>

454
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:38,860
connection at all or it's just

455
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:41,449
unworkable be bad if you play with it

456
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,629
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a with a formula</font>

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:48,800
like this or for a score between two

458
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:51,620
points which essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I want blunt</font>

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:54,889
explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> is's and running out of time but</font>

460
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:57,290
essentially it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> three fact three</font>

461
00:23:54,890 --> 00:24:00,650
contributions the last contribution a

462
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,149
delay very a delay contribution and a

463
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:06,380
variation in interview

464
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:08,780
contribution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we were sold to</font>

465
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:11,270
need this that this is something where

466
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,430
we're going to calculate 80 and compare

467
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,920
against previous results and then

468
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,380
provide you with a list for the

469
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:20,690
individual connections and then do the

470
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:23,210
average for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the connections</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

471
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,040
if the score and you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

472
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:28,010
afraid that this will end up in the

<font color="#CCCCCC">serve web page so that brings me to my</font>

478
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:46,460
last point what if you want to find this

479
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,250
interesting and you want the hosted test

480
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:52,330
box well that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change and it's</font>

481
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:55,010
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the better so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

482
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:58,760
this project was funded from the thumb

483
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:01,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">drive general budgets so we were limited</font>

484
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:05,030
to giving the boxes away inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

485
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:07,699
community only and we had to put a limit

486
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:10,610
of one box four sides or one box per

487
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:15,890
member but most people have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

488
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:17,629
one pops a zit once they might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

489
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:24,410
install a box at each of their pups or

490
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:28,870
or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an interest</font>

491
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:32,150
outside tribe area well so as of a

492
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:35,000
prosthetic alee calls and buy as many

493
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,800
boxes as he or she likes because with

494
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:43,580
the restriction that we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

495
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:45,980
to produce it now boxes the model will

496
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">be that you pay one for the box in and</font>

497
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,860
it's one of these tests boxes about two

498
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:54,800
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> half thousand US dollars and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll</font>

499
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,889
also pay a yearly fee and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> afraid</font>

500
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,990
that i can give you a number on that

501
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:02,480
will be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the same order</font>

502
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:03,450
surprise of the test box for operating

503
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,240
it

504
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:09,899
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NCC running the analysis coats</font>

505
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:16,230
provide you with all the numbers we

506
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:18,500
showed you on the previous slides and in

507
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,389
parallel with that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also will offer a</font>

508
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,370
possibility to do private experiments so

509
00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:27,418
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> we we've always said okay we have to</font>

510
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:30,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">smash them test boxes and we just</font>

511
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:33,179
measure on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the small mesh and show</font>

512
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,428
everybody the results some people might

513
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:37,049
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say okay I have five pups I</font>

514
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:40,049
think just want to really be my five

515
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:43,710
bucks and yes that's possible then as

516
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:46,740
well details and this is mainly

517
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:50,669
political and stuff like that well we

518
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:54,960
discussed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> at right 35 out of this</font>

519
00:26:50,669 --> 00:26:56,100
month at which<font color="#CCCCCC"> point well if you're on</font>

520
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">the right list you will see the</font>

521
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:03,928
announcements appear so to conclude I've

522
00:27:01,409 --> 00:27:06,600
shown<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have a set up to measure</font>

523
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:10,110
network delays in packet losses if

524
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,689
product for daily for daily use we're

525
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:16,289
always looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> more sites interested</font>

526
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:20,809
in those in one of our boxes and just to

527
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:24,629
finish off with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the contact information</font>

539
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:03,559
all I'm a satisfied user<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just want to</font>

540
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,330
say that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty neat stuff I'm</font>

541
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,899
good computer science it's good

542
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:13,909
operations and it actually does useful

543
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:16,370
things secondly there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> warning which</font>

544
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:21,679
I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not think can be sufficiently</font>

545
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:27,800
stressed which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box requires an</font>

546
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:30,140
antenna and for those of us in pops in

547
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,520
carrier what are called carrier class

548
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,330
facilities hopefully they're a little

549
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,059
better than that um this is exceedingly

550
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,840
difficult yeah that's that's why we're

551
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:44,750
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards a different clock and I</font>

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,629
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not if the thing works as</font>

553
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:50,059
we think it works and we're in the

<font color="#E5E5E5">process of testing this all all you have</font>

555
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:55,850
to do is a half is access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the roof</font>

556
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:58,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the possibility do run cat 500 all</font>

legal departments and contracts and

560
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:10,610
horrible<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we shouldn't be</font>

the right crew is wonderful they're easy

567
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:26,210
to work with the technology is great the

568
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:31,520
boxes are solid it's getting to the roof

569
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:34,520
is hell and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's a problem</font>

570
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,670
Hank and scaling and I'm wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

571
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:39,080
you're going to approach that it's that

572
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:41,570
the boxes themselves are not

573
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:44,389
self-sufficient in other words my box

574
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,860
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> website that I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font>

575
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,910
to and it tells me how<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's doing</font>

576
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:52,610
talking to all the other boxes there's a

577
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:55,640
centralized facility where the data are

578
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:59,330
collected and massage and if this

579
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,250
becomes popular which I hope it does

580
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:04,580
what are the thoughts of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

581
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:07,110
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to scale that</font>

582
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,540
internationally and and one suggestion

583
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:11,790
that I've made<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the past is to start a</font>

584
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:14,070
conspiracy of operators over here to

585
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:16,379
help break it into two<font color="#CCCCCC"> pieces at least</font>

586
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:18,510
across the pup whatever I mean what do

587
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">you folks thinking on that and I will be</font>

588
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:27,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">in amsterdam in two weeks or whatever to</font>

589
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:31,830
whine about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there too yeah i think</font>

590
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:36,900
our web server as such can handle can

591
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:38,370
handle the data processing processing I

592
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,530
mean it's something we're thinking about

593
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:43,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the moment we have one big son</font>

594
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:45,629
machine processing it and at some point

595
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,830
we have to paralyze that and just buy

596
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:52,680
buy buy a few more machines to do to do

597
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:55,500
the processing and where we do where we

598
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:59,100
do this I mean if we just take all these

599
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">boxes at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mcc or put them in various</font>

600
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:04,340
places all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is still to be</font>

601
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,340
studied

602
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:10,669
hey
