expanding this is this shows about

80
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:36,370
traffic growth this is five minutes

81
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:40,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">average this 300 maybe p s is January</font>

82

last year and this year we recorded 780

83
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:53,070
and I expect in one year it will become

84
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:59,370
1 point 4 Giga<font color="#E5E5E5"> bps so the traffic is</font>

growing constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably if we reach</font>

86
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:07,630
1.4 probably we may also encounters some

produce also some operational specs I

150
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:12,759
mean we do not produce sparkles with

151

we had this exchange point for about

172
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:28,600
like two years but only I'd say in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

if they connect directly in the switch

00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,800
of the exchange point they will be

203
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:00,950
providing free internet access so the

because telecom little eyes Brazil are

00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,960
still very expensive when the prices are

222

going down but their servers are very

223
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,860
expensive compared to the USA we have

n 100 switch several raha router is

00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,010
also do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of logging so you can get</font>

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:39,320
some statistics there is a static

234
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:44,120
statistical is not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much and we have</font>

235
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:48,640
like a peak of 27 mags going in and out

236
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:50,750
in the switch is the weekly traffic and

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,230
going through switch of the exchange

238
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:58,250
point we I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the ESPYs in</font>

239
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,810
Brazil they have to pay like the

depending on where they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to</font>

pay like<font color="#CCCCCC"> two thousand dollars for are</font>

242
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:09,559
you online or more so it's very

243
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:13,520
expensive so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have set the minimum</font>

connecting speed to the I speed up to at

some high speeds that it's too much and

247
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,890
there is some ice peas which are

248
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:31,730
connected like at eight mag which is

mostly global one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighteen t in the</font>

250
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,140
future plans we will collect some

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,600
statistics on stability a number of

then to operating the equipment the

00:17:50,179 --> 00:17:55,730
equipment is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough for now so we</font>

00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:57,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan should get some my statistics on</font>

stability and the number of the ESN

259

this you know you can do some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar with been working on</font>

referred to in the in the previous talk

465
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:30,520
ATM service internet working but all

466
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that aside all of all the customers get</font>

467
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:36,040
a full mesh of PVCs so we try to make

468
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:38,919
this thing as transparent as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

469
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,990
ingress policing so it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> BR you know</font>

470
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,700
again we're trying to be transparent and

471
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,890
I've got to put this last bullet up for

472
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:48,130
bill every time that there's little to

473
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:49,660
no congestion loss at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago</font>

474
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,450
exchange I mean around the periphery of

475
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:54,210
course was going to be but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Spees have</font>

476
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,950
been real good about upgrading their

477
00:29:54,210 --> 00:30:00,100
ports to a higher capacity so on our

478
00:29:56,950 --> 00:30:03,820
egress buffers we don't see very much

479
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:05,139
congestion loss at all there you go go

480
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,389
so now you've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can ask</font>

481
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:10,720
me afterwards about you know where is

00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:12,460
the congestion in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet snapshot</font>

483
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:14,770
of where we are today there are 104

484
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:20,750
connections which is pretty good<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

485
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:23,690
high peaks at 2.4 I'm I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get that</font>

486
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:26,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I think we're all we kind of reach</font>

487
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">about I'm looking forward</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a point</font>

488
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:29,540
where we can say that we're the largest

489
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,280
exchange in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world but we're kind of</font>

490
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,740
to the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> now where we can say or</font>

491
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:35,210
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest ATM exchange but</font>

492
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,000
we're the largest exchange depending on

493
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:40,640
what day of the week because we kind of

494
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,980
go back and forth between<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> East for a</font>

495
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,020
while we were running about 2 to about

496
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,580
two and a half to 2 300 megabits per

497
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,740
second higher than their peaks but I

498
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,300
think they're higher now so I you know

499
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:53,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">we go back and forth that's still that's</font>

500
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,860
quite a bit of traffic about<font color="#E5E5E5"> sixty</font>

501
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,500
percent of the connections are<font color="#CCCCCC"> oc-3 a</font>

502
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:59,570
lot of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to OC 12 the you</font>

503
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,300
know particular the major<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISPs movement</font>

504
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:04,760
of toasty 12 so that's a thing and its

505
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:08,659
last bullet you know it's a tangential

506
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:11,930
issue but there are some huge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

507
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:17,540
should say colocation facilities being

508
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:20,210
built in Chicago like 15 story buildings

509
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:23,870
with you know a hundred thousand square

510
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:26,720
feet per floor one of the examples is an

511
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:28,520
ex an old printing press building that

512
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,290
its enormous and these things are being

513
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,180
turned into colocation and they call me

514
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:33,649
of course because they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get nap</font>

515
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,290
connectivity extended to these

516
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:38,690
facilities but it's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

517
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to say you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know you've got three</font>

518
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:44,510
million square feet of globe Colo space

519
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:48,350
being built in your city Chicago's a hub

520
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:54,379
and every way all right rolling right

521
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:58,939
along this is like in the last 60 days

522
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:01,460
where we've been some changes and some

523
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,410
that are about<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen if you're on</font>

524
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,260
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't be I'm sorry if</font>

525
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:09,050
you're on there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should if you're</font>

526
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:11,390
not you should be i'm sorry also i think

527
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:13,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> accurate we have a big</font>

528
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:18,410
bubble coming through your two cables

529
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:21,830
was you know an event so we locked down

530
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:23,960
in a big way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing happened i</font>

531
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:27,020
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nothing happened in and</font>

532
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">November towards December for sure so</font>

533
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,090
we've got a big bubble of connections

534
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:31,780
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

535
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:34,189
through now the things are rolling again

536
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:36,770
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also kind of interesting that it</font>

537
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,030
shows a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of the different</font>

538
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,190
kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> connectivity we support of</font>

539
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,530
course as a large number of ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

540
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,110
know several more<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting in OC 12 then</font>

541
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:48,070
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of international</font>

542
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:51,379
connectivity in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europeans are</font>

543
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,970
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very active in the last 60 to</font>

544
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,890
90 days and getting connectivity in and

545
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:57,710
a couple of corporate customers motorola

546
00:32:54,890 --> 00:33:01,700
com disco are putting their own

547
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:04,760
connections right into the nap this is

548
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,620
what the nap looks like it's pretty

549
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">straight forward force we're up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to four</font>

550
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,899
switches now most of the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

551
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,470
going on in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 550's at the bottom</font>

552
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:17,630
trunk together with OC 48 we we maintain

553
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:21,110
these five hundreds at the top to do the

554
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:23,000
ds3 connectivity but ps3's are kind of

555
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:25,689
going away these days and so most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

556
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,900
work is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in the core 550's</font>

557
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:31,720
I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> pictures on the website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

558
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:34,340
pulled one off<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuck it in this talk</font>

559

560
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:41,179
switch site you'll be dramatically

561
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:43,040
decidedly under impressed by three or

562
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:46,310
four ATM switches in the cabinet that

563
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,480
are the largest exchange of the water in

564
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:51,169
the world depending on the day you're

565
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,790
looking at them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that was it for</font>

566
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:55,520
Chicago I think I did a good job of

567
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:59,450
being right to the point there's my

568
00:33:55,520 --> 00:34:01,879
contact information<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kevin Pietersen is</font>

569
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:03,860
the real hands-on guy there's Kevin in

570

<font color="#E5E5E5">the back Kevin you can raise your hand</font>

571
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:08,359
this is a wonderful opportunity to

572
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:11,800
actually put a face on them on the name

573
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:13,880
our website has contact information and

574
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,760
some were pretty pictures of the

579
00:34:25,699 --> 00:34:31,089
that is 70 customers the total number of

580
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:33,920
ports is quite a bit higher that's typo

581
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:36,680
I'd be a real trick that's better than

582
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:41,110
like 700 mega and we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> 700 mega</font>

584
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,130
and about 1.4 gig so you know it's an

585
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,770
interesting exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think actually</font>

586
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:50,050
i'm running the two largest ATM exchange

00:34:50,050 --> 00:35:01,830
should be proud or ashamed but this is I

00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:04,569
like to think of this one as mini me ok

590
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:06,460
there's some pakka contact information

locations that are either operating or

608
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:58,740
very close to operating in Palo Alto we

609
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:01,000
opened a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ground-floor expansion space</font>

610
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:04,089
since the original exchange was in the

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">basement and that is mostly full we have</font>

612
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:09,100
signed a lease for a second facility

613
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:11,500
elsewhere in town lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> dark fiber</font>

614
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:16,509
between them and that will be open later

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:20,730
in the year<font color="#CCCCCC"> over at tysons corner about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">va1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there will be lots of dark fiber</font>

624
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:46,340
a lot of other towns so there won't be

625
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,259
quite so many people trenching to this

626

building<font color="#E5E5E5"> as have trench to the Palo Alto</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">go there are people doing installs now</font>

629
00:37:53,810 --> 00:38:02,509
but we're not officially opening until

630
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:05,959
sometime in March<font color="#E5E5E5"> mfn has fiber hotels</font>

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,750
being a wholly owned subsidiary can

634
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:17,540
build an exchange in any one of those or

635
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:22,610
all of them all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that needs is a</font>

00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:26,000
successful story to tell and as to which

637
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:31,460
ones we're opening in next I would be

638
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,770
fired if I said so I won't but customers

639
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:36,380
will pretty much tell us what to do in

00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:39,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> regard and if you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested</font>

644

the form if you build it I will come so

645
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently we have many flavors of</font>

647
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,590
not adding any more fitty connections

648
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:05,210
the pity that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have is an albatross</font>

649
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:07,760
around our neck we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be rid of</font>

650
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,770
it soon those of you who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are customers</font>

651
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,660
know how much pressure I'm putting on

652
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:17,450
customers to get rid of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> fitty we're</font>

653
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:19,879
looking into some other switching

654
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:21,950
technologies but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the shorter term</font>

655
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,840
than that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply have to get higher</font>

656
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:26,629
density<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gigabit Ethernet than we have</font>

657
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,230
now there are I think for customers

658
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,120
attached at gigabit speed and

659
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:34,010
indications are that another 40 would

660
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:36,700
like to do that and the current switches

661
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:39,080
are not dense enough so we will be

662
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:41,210
changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of switch that we use</font>

663
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:43,970
probably before we change the kind of

664
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:47,720
protocol that we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally think</font>

665
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:51,339
that mpls or 10 gige are going to be the

666
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">next big winner</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this space</font>

667
00:39:54,020 --> 00:40:02,099
and as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote purine you saw on</font>

668
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:04,890
Lance's slides that we are planning on

669
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:08,069
putting some Giggy between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ames</font>

670
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:12,900
exchange point and packs this will not

671
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:15,119
be bridged as the a<font color="#E5E5E5"> West and Mae West</font>

672
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,809
aims are done this will be two different

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">fabrics simply for the purpose of</font>

so anyone who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be comparing with</font>

678
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:33,480
people in both exchanges will still have

<font color="#CCCCCC">to buy a port from two different</font>

680
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:38,880
providers if you will and that will keep

681
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,770
us from having to answer the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> G</font>

that particular trunk link those yeah

684
00:40:45,180 --> 00:41:10,520
enough said about that that's it see

685
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:21,960
well my dad told me as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always open to</font>

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:29,129
the electron says the molecule I've lost

689

I'm sorry the item says to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> molecule</font>

three I be X's up in operation in terms

of the interconnection media there are

really three forms of inter connection

the point-to-point folks are using dark

fiber and you can drive that or whatever

right ah you guys my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean darlin</font>

999
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,919
this is probably a question for Keith

1000
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:45,040
the links hosted a conference call for

1001
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:49,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">all its participants over the January</font>

1002
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:52,119
y2k party I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering how well that</font>

1003
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:55,660
was received and whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

1004
00:55:52,119 --> 00:56:00,090
participants might look towards the

1005
00:55:55,660 --> 00:56:11,920
exchange hosting other interest amor

1006
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:13,300
communications in the future the most

1007
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">exciting thing that happened was a</font>

1008
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:20,650
little bit of hacker activity that we

1009
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:22,930
saw really<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I think it was it was</font>

1010
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:24,490
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> to conduct a exercise it was</font>

1011
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:26,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to conduct a whole load of the</font>

1012
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:28,779
y2k preparation we did quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

1013
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">work there and i think it was useful</font>

1014
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:33,460
about teaching us how to handle major

1015
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:35,859
events and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> due diligence and all</font>

1016
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:37,869
the rest of it frankly I'd much rather

1017
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:39,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">than partying with my friends and family</font>

1018
00:56:37,869 --> 00:56:41,440
than participating in teleconference /

1019
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,609
doesn't not a reflection on the good

1020
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,470
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who participated in the</font>

1021
00:56:42,609 --> 00:56:49,150
teleconference certainly you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

1022
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:50,439
here to facilitate coordination in the

1023
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,450
industry that's what we're here to do

1024
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,030
and if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinks that they're</font>

1025
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:58,859
appropriate events or opportunities in

1026
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:58,859
the near future very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to do that</font>

1027
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:11,660
and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you everyone who did</font>

1028
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:21,650
participate others<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the treat is</font>

1029
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:24,589
coming after just a hobby oh um well not

1030
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:28,940
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> length the link between the Ames</font>

1031
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:30,470
exchange and packs will that be them how

1032
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:32,330
is the management<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that done alone</font>

1033
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:34,009
with the 100 Meg ports<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimate will not</font>

1034
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:37,040
be oversubscribed or is that just going

1035
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:44,750
to be I'm just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering how management</font>

1036
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:46,400
of that will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done right the first the</font>

1037
00:57:44,750 --> 00:57:50,420
management of the individual links will

1038
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:54,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">be handled by each entity so I'll worry</font>

1039
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:57,560
about the link for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Mae West and Paul</font>

1040
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:59,630
will worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> his and since it is</font>

1041
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:05,830
dark fiber no we do not plan on over

1042
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:08,360
some surviving the links<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

1043
00:58:05,830 --> 00:58:11,060
important thing to remember here is that

1044
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:15,050
there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be two links I'm remoting a</font>

1045
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:17,390
switch in Lance's facility bridged on<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1046
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:20,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">my switches he's remoting a switch in my</font>

1047
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:23,779
facility bridged onto his it is

1048
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:25,460
certainly taxes policy being owned by a

1049
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:31,630
dark fiber carrier that there shall be

1050
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:35,270
no congestion when we do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1051
00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:37,700
Steve's facility will try very very much

1052
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:39,980
to keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> this on policy all the Steve's</font>

1053
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:42,470
facility is harder to get into since

1054
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:45,700
it's owned<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the commercial sector</font>

1055
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:45,700
rather than the military

1056
00:58:48,849 --> 00:58:55,549
I had Steve Feldman two questions first

1057
00:58:53,059 --> 00:58:58,099
one is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lance there was something</font>

1058
00:58:55,549 --> 00:59:00,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple weeks ago about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with</font>

1059
00:58:58,099 --> 00:59:08,079
fragmentation between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Giga switch</font>

1060
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:08,079
and the SSR what came of that anything

1061
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:20,369
I believe the problem you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> referring</font>

1062
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:24,560
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> was I think Paul you might have found</font>

1063
00:59:20,369 --> 00:59:28,500
this if you have to customers that are

1064
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:33,440
talking fitty fitting two fiddy on the

1065
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:33,440
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> Giga switch that has the fastback</font>

1066
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:42,000
the fast ethernet cards in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was told</font>

1067
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:48,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm a verified miss that it could or has</font>

1068
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:50,430
in the past it will not allow a MTU of

1069
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,869
greater than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1500 it basically starts</font>

1070
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:55,230
dropping packets doesn't do the

1071
00:59:51,869 --> 00:59:57,150
fragmentation what became of it I

1072
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:59,160
haven't verified it yet I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1073
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">encourage the route servers to move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1074
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:04,350
fast ethernet along with everybody else

1075
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay my second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is for Bill</font>

1076
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:17,490
Norton and that is are you really

1077
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:20,520
starting to reuse your jokes hi Jeff oz

1078
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:24,509
I read their out<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers right now to</font>

1079
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:26,220
clarify the problem that we saw if they

1080
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:28,980
don't fragment bit is set the pack it

1081
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:32,069
does get dropped what the don't fragment

1082
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,500
bit is clear the switch will do the

1083
01:00:32,070 --> 01:00:36,060
right thing and fragment the packet but

1084
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:38,550
the course breaks path MTU discovery

1085
01:00:36,060 --> 01:00:41,720
that's been the solution on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the route</font>

1086
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,720
servers themselves to shut that off

1087
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:55,160
when when are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too fast</font>

1088
01:00:48,710 --> 01:01:03,170
ethernet when can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get you there next</font>

1089
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:08,598
week real talk Jeff's from Merritt I

1090
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:13,540
thought I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> just point that out ok no</font>

1091
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:13,540
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions we will</font>
