<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I have two honors first one I get</font>

to be the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaker of the day second</font>

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,990
one I get to follow Jeff Houston it's

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,730
like they hate me okay anyone who fits

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,680
the followed Jeff you know you're always

6
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:23,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be second but it's the way it</font>

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">is great presentation I'm going to go</font>

8
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:26,079
pretty quick and what I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

9
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:28,660
up is the fact that we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very</font>

10
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:31,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting year in the US government</font>

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and how it deals with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet going</font>

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,120
to highlight what's happened and I'm

13
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,680
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a little bit about what</font>

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,629
might be happening because we've also

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,190
had some changes recently this will be

16
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:45,329
some questions at the end but this is

17
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:49,570
mostly a thought exercise few folks okay

18
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:54,370
so see if we can get a next page out of

19
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:56,109
this thing here we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay recent</font>

20
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:59,519
internet developments a couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

21
00:00:56,109 --> 00:01:03,579
that happened the big one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happened</font>

22
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier this earlier last year actually</font>

23
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,690
year and a half ago but finished last

24
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">year we had the FCC open Internet</font>

25
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:11,800
reclassification<font color="#CCCCCC"> order for folks who are</font>

26
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,600
here yesterday you got to have lunch

27
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,160
with some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC staff which was</font>

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">very nice they talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font>

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,429
engage with<font color="#CCCCCC"> them on on open matters and</font>

30
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,979
why it's important well this is one of

31
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ones that's going to be a hot button</font>

32
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,350
coming up mush what they did is<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

33
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:32,170
change the definition of Internet

34
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:35,130
broadband service for the last 30 years

35
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,540
as since we've really had an internet

36
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,470
internet service has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been an enhanced</font>

37
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:44,410
service and what's occurred is that as

38
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:49,000
of the is a way of implementing net

39
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:51,429
neutrality the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC issued an order which</font>

40
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,970
remanded internet service we categorized

41
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,880
it as a basic telecommunication service

42
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:00,250
so put it in the same world as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

43
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,310
phone phone lines now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

44
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,660
interesting when you do that you pick up

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:10,539
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of regulation everything from what</font>

46
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,250
the how much can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you charge phone</font>

47
00:02:10,538 --> 00:02:14,429
service is something the file tariffs

48
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:17,590
for and it's regulated entity

49
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,590
obligations for things like contribute

50
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,840
contributions to you

51
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">Russell access funds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and similar things</font>

52
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,060
so the FCC did is they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay rugby</font>

53
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,400
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not an enhanced</font>

54
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,560
service it's a basic telecommunication

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,709
service and because it is it's now under

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,420
our regulation very nice one way to

57
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,849
expand your authority is to change the

58
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:40,458
definitions underneath your definition

59
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,530
of authority so now it's suddenly

60
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:44,540
subject to their authority<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they</font>

61
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,239
said but all of the parts that we don't

62
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,780
need we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to forbear we're going</font>

63
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:53,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not use will refrain with respect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

64
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:56,660
the internet from several hundred

65
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:58,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">aspects of telecom regulation the only</font>

66
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:01,760
thing we really want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is no you</font>

67
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,980
can't block people you can't throttle

68
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,739
people and you can't engage in pay

69
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:11,450
prioritization and that is the essence

70
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:13,849
of the 378 page reclassification<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font>

71
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:16,480
the open Internet order basically they

72
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:19,220
said look if I SP<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow interfere and</font>

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,649
choose winners and losers for their

74
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,170
customers services they can use and

75
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,870
services they can't and do preferences

76
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:28,970
then we'll hear the complaints about

77
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,280
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ability to act</font>

78
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,680
they set up a process where you could

79
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,190
complain and they said if we set this up

80
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,750
and we forbear all of our other

81
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">authority it should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font>

82
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,489
job and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it probably is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> except the fact</font>

83
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you don't know whether the FCC next</font>

84
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,599
year or the year after or five years

85
00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">from now might decide to take all the</font>

86
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">authority it has those hundreds of other</font>

87
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,959
provisions and bring them back on the

88
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:55,099
table<font color="#CCCCCC"> and use them so it's an</font>

89
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting way of getting the job done</font>

90
00:03:55,099 --> 00:04:00,260
and it did work regardless of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

91
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,620
you think net neutrality is a good thing

92
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:06,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">or a bad thing the manner by which it</font>

93
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,880
was done is definitely an interesting

94
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:11,030
item we're thinking about because

95
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,090
effectively the internet is now

96
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:18,798
regulated but they have decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to</font>

97
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:20,329
exercise all of their rights to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so in</font>

98
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,299
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of this so oh so how do I</font>

99
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:26,659
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I do Aaron Aaron</font>

100
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,210
set IP registry you guys know us and we

101
00:04:26,659 --> 00:04:31,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't take positions on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 99% of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

102
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,270
stuff but we do get asked occasionally

103
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,190
how it will affect the IP number

104
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,620
registry in fact in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did get</font>

105
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:39,930
asked that I said please make sure you

106
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't accidentally change numbers and so</font>

107
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,410
there actually is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement in the</font>

108
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,260
open Internet order that specifically

109
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,260
says this doesn't change how I p

110
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:52,020
addresses are administered because you

111
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:54,090
could easily read it as doing otherwise

112
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,400
and making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like phone numbers so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

113
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,599
put something<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that effect Aaron</font>

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,969
doesn't take any position on these

115
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">because basically every service provider</font>

116
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:05,130
in our region uses Aaron and and some of

117
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,510
you feel one way and some of you feel

118
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:09,060
another so even though we're a trade

119
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:11,090
association there's very few matters we

120
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,980
actually advocate and take a stance on

121
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:16,739
this open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet reclassification</font>

122
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:18,570
order is likely to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hot potato in</font>

123
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,950
the coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> year I'll come back and talk</font>

124
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there were some other</font>

125
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,229
developments um we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually heard about</font>

126
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,610
one of these earlier and I put it here

127
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:29,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">dmca online designated agent</font>

of receiving takedown notices you really

131
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,740
should go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the library of congress</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

134
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">important our speaker earlier today</font>

135
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,560
Jennifer was very nice to point out that

136
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:47,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do it and you ignore the</font>

137
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
notices you actually do have the ability

138
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">to lose the safe-harbor provision</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

139
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,860
probably don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that let's</font>

140
00:05:53,100 --> 00:06:00,420
see section 230 of the CDA yeah so

141
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,860
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this interesting thing going on</font>

142
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:04,470
that people should know about which is

143
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the Communications Decency Act</font>

144
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:11,300
basically exempted intermediates from

145
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,670

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,320
some liability about what

161
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,280
and this will affect you because

162
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,870
obviously as a service provider you

163
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">generally don't worry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the content</font>

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">this depending</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on how it falls could</font>

166
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:06,160
easily affect the hosting organization

168
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,350
and computer crime statutes yeah that's

169
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,849
another good one so you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

170
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:14,320
we do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer crime statute out</font>

171
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,480
there in the US and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:20,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">countries have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> similar and that computer</font>

173
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,810
crime statute basically says that if you

174
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:25,030
attempt to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a system that you're not</font>

authorized to you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

176
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:29,349
committing a crime now this is different

177
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">than violating your contract you sign up</font>

179
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,720
terms of use and there's a contract

180
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:37,479
there no I'm actually talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,940
you intentionally use it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

182
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,470
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to well its come</font>

183
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting with terms of use because</font>

184
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,940
what if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use it in a way they</font>

185
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't want you to like you use a screen</font>

187
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:54,370
they say don't use a screen scraper are

188
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,219
you violating the terms of use or are

189
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:59,650
you committing a crime and that's pretty

190
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,870
important to know actually it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

191
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,820
sizeable difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between having a</font>

192
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:06,070
dispute with someone end creating a

193
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:07,870
criminal act this clarified in the

194
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,360
federal courts last year pretty clearly

195
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,130
you're not committing a crime if you

196
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">just use something in a way but you're</font>

197
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,120
an authorized in a way they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't expect</font>

198
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:19,719
that you're an authorized user it's not

199
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,490
clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the state cybercrime statutes</font>

200
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:25,390
so we have some cases going on right now

201
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:26,710
where various states have said it's a

202
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,140
crime to do the same thing the federal

203
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:31,539
law does to use something contrary to

204
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,240
the Terms of Service and that's a

205
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,400
criminal act under state law this is

206
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,260
active in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> courts as well so those</font>

207
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the developments of last year that</font>

208
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,020
you folks might want to pay attention to

209
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,490
let's talk about what we might see

210
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:47,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually I see the skipped one we go</font>

211
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,560
back one this one thing that happened

212
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:53,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">last year the US government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,029
registries like that dnf sex signs root

<font color="#CCCCCC">like port numbers and and mine types</font>

this has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> done by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nominally at</font>

the request of the US government for all

225
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years and what happened is over</font>

226
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:32,509
the last two years we've had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a process</font>

227
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:35,269
so that instead the respective

228

communities so the i kin community for

229

230
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:41,959
and the protocol the IETF for the

231
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,630
protocol parameter community are all

232
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,540
contracting with I can or its affiliate

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PTI affiliate to do the same thing</font>

234
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,790
and effectively we put those contracts

00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in place and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia said we don't need a</font>

just now being done at the request me to

287
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:00,770
say so not because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say so so we</font>

288
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think the IANA functions</font>

289
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:06,110
transition is going to materially change

290
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:08,180
but you know Laura's law if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gets</font>

291
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,520
picked up by the US Congress and law as

292
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,400
a past you know abiding by law can

293
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:15,530
change a number of things FCC open

294
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:19,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet reclassification order okay</font>

295
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:22,420
this is already in a major change so

296
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:24,260
enforcement is changing meaning there's

297
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,589
circumstances that are not being

298
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:30,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">enforced now for example under the open</font>

299
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,810
Internet order you could decide that

300
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,700
free services<font color="#CCCCCC"> bundled free services</font>

301
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,660
weren't appropriate we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> do have</font>

302
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:40,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">mobile providers who are offering free</font>

303
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,390
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to certain like video services</font>

304
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,820
and they're no longer being pursued by

305
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:47,990
the FCC the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC has said basically we're</font>

306
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,880
not looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this in fact we're</font>

307
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,650
looking at the old framework to try to

308
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,420
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do it we have a new</font>

309
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:55,640
FCC Commissioner the FCC has five

310
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,240
commissioners this time<font color="#CCCCCC"> free are seated</font>

311
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:03,170
we know the new FCC Commissioner chair

312
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:05,810
Ajapai and his filing for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

313
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,030
Internet order when it was filed in

314
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,579
opposition of it is good reading if you

315
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:13,010
want to understand what the current FCC

316
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,830
Commissioner thinks of the current open

317
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet order you can see his comments</font>

318
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:21,290
when he<font color="#E5E5E5"> voted against it we could end up</font>

319
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">with a circumstance so the FCC just</font>

320
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,439
defers enforcing the open Internet order

321
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,560
we could also end up in a circumstance

322
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,540
where they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> open a proceeding</font>

323
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,849
and we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday in the FCC</font>

324
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:35,069
when the SEC staff were here once they

325
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,770
open a proceeding it's time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment</font>

326
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,390
so pay attention because<font color="#E5E5E5"> proceeding</font>

327
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,430
opens you would like to get involved

328
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:44,520
some of you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to get involved</font>

329
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,439
and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these provisions stay</font>

330
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,930
in place some of you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get</font>

331
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,630
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say these provisions should</font>

332
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:53,459
go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it doesn't matter the point</font>

333
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,410
is get involved is what's going to be

334
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:57,780
important because there probably will be

335
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:01,110
a proceeding that revisits part of this

336
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:04,439
there is a potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this to end up</font>

337
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:07,020
not an FCC matter the FCC ends up in

338
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,900
forcing communications policy and

339
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:12,000
developing policy within the legal

340
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,730
framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible legal framework</font>

341
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,500
will be reopened this could all end up

342
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US Congress and well they've got</font>

343
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> busy here ahead of them this</font>

344
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,380
health care thing apparently is big and

345
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,110
there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they need</font>

346
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but this may still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end up</font>

347
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,570
being discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and revisited in which</font>

348
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,089
case it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same topic get involved</font>

349
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,060
but it's not the FCC it's your local

350
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:42,510
congressman and something to think about

351
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:44,699
and there's also some discussion so all

352
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,870
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about protecting consumers we</font>

353
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,580
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an agency in the US</font>

354
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:50,310
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the Federal Trade</font>

355
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,530
Commission that full-time worries about

356
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:53,729
consumer protections and so there's some

357
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:56,250
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> of whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or not some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

358
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:58,590
roles aren't an FCC matter anyway maybe

359
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,800
they should be FTC which will make for

360
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,150
an interesting dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay not going to</font>

361
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,459
see much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> on that I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

362
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,890
one is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so increased discussion</font>

363
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,600
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and user attribution this</font>

364
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:11,430
is driven by the sum of the cybercrime

365
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:16,800
discussions that we heard earlier this

366
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:20,160
morning there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a concern that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

understand every user of every IP

address what we want to get to is the

383
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:06,569
right isp so we can actually use<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawful</font>

order we can actually serve them on

appropriately adjudicated warrant or

386
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,360
subpoena rather than going to an ISP and

387
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,670
having them refer them to another isp

388
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,770
then says they delegated it to a third

389
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:19,479
isp now they've gone and gotten three

390

court orders when they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

Congress or the congressional oversight

00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:45,550
committees so something to pay attention

400
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:47,470
to that is my 14 minute whirlwind tour

401
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,910
what's happening in the US government

402
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,730
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet I'll take some questions</font>

but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am the last speaker so let's get</font>

404
00:16:51,730 --> 00:17:02,050
this over quick I had Lee Howard

405
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:04,420
unaffiliated John we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> loss</font>

of communications and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then computer</font>

00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">was about is that going to affect Aaron</font>

whether nan all to be affected by that

415
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:26,589
if it were reinstated which particular

416
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:28,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">profile then the travel ban yet well so</font>

417
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,429
we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a circumstance where the US</font>

government currently has a travel ban

that's currently being appealed and

420
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,730
they're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually decide what</font>

will be the temporary circumstances

422
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:41,290
before they in the months that they'll

423
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:43,690
hear the merits of the travel ban and

424
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,710
that will affect parties we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already know</font>

425
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,909
there's an upcoming itm meeting

426
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:48,529
there are people who are concerned about

427

their<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to go to it and come back</font>

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:54,799
affect<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron our upcoming meeting as New</font>

430
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:57,919
Orleans and well that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strange place</font>

431
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,779
it's still<font color="#CCCCCC"> within the country boy it's</font>

432
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,700
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country we're currently in</font>

433
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:03,500
its not within every country in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the air</font>

434
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,480
in region it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not within every country</font>

435
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,820
in the Aaron region but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the majority of</font>

436
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:10,520
people attending<font color="#CCCCCC"> an iron meeting Canada</font>

437
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,110
u.s. and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Caribbean so we're unlikely</font>

438
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,610
to be affected there are other<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

439
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:16,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">Governance organizations that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> likely</font>

440
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:18,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be affected we don't see that we will</font>

441
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,520
see that coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tober meeting</font>

442
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,929
because when we get larger meetings we

443
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,668
go with nanog ban against other

444
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:27,500
attendees it is possible that will have

445
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,940
implications but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we also don't know</font>

446
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,250
whether it'll be in effect at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

447
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,559
so we have actually what happens that is

448
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,440
part of what i was asking it is also you

449
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,000
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet governance</font>

450
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations where sometimes it's a</font>

451
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,240
really good thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have nano as we</font>

452
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,950
errands deaths are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network's times</font>

453
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,510
like mind you to have Aaron's death as

454
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:50,299
the ad and I can meeting or GF or

455
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:51,980
something like that we'd affect their

456
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:54,049
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue this right we've</font>

457
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,970
actually done a quick review with

458
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:58,879
respect to Aaron regarding staff

459
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,679
advisory council board attendance we're

460
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,899
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have it</font>

461
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:05,840
an impact but that's more coincidental

462
00:19:02,899 --> 00:19:07,039
of composition than it is we do know in

463
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case as they said if I can where</font>

464
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,179
there is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact but the good news is</font>

465
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we don't see anything immediate for</font>

466
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:16,220
us and long term as I said this is

467
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:19,370
something that's actively being killed

468
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,380
in the course<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I don't anybody behind</font>

469
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:25,520
me another kind of quick question the

470
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,539
animal so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is interesting</font>

471
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,370
there's obviously if there's a lot going

472
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,289
on it's done the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the u.s.</font>

473
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,178
government does affect a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us but</font>

474
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:35,330
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> both Aaron and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nana's aren't just</font>

475
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:38,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US can we should we see a review of</font>

476
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,100
other governments like hey there's this

477
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,750
other government<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada there are</font>

478
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,060
probably Canadians in the room it would

479
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,560
give

480
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,210
but their laws more than us laws and

481
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,340
they're all these governments in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

482
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,200
Caribbean right so since I was asked to

483
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">come and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the implications of</font>

484
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,040
what's happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US government</font>

485
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:54,929
that's why I'm here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I am going to DC</font>

486
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">I recognize we actually do track</font>

487
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:59,160
developments in Canada<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and the other</font>

488
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:00,840
25 countries from the Caribbean that are

489
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,210
in the Aaron region for how they impact

490
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron developments but again folks most</font>

491
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:05,940
important thing we're tracking this to

492
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,890
make sure it doesn't interfere with

493
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,550
registry operations we're not advocating

494
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:12,960
we don't take positions because if you

495
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,120
have every<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and hosting company</font>

496
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,940
participating you have the full rainbow

497
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,010
of views<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to you to get</font>

498
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved but I'm happy to come talk</font>

499
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:24,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> regions if they ever get</font>

500
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:26,760
to the point where they impact us as

501
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,940
potentially like the US government<font color="#E5E5E5"> is so</font>

502
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:35,040
famous of doing hey thanks any other

503
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:37,520
