8
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:41,170
of closing this meaning but I thought as

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:46,030
usual I would share<font color="#CCCCCC"> some information and</font>

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:48,430
thoughts with you I'm short excuse me so

13
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,559
they're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little enjoyable as a peek</font>

14
00:00:53,050 --> 00:01:04,899
into what others thought it seemed like

15
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:09,789

41
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,410
these folks through their sponsorship

42
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:34,209
dollars make it possible so thank you to

44
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">one value which is return on investment</font>

45
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:42,850
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm glad the feedback from our</font>

46
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:46,050
sponsors was that you all stop by their

47
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:49,120
table or their their exhibit and

48
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:51,970
participated in conversation picked up

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,170
some schwag<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's important for them to</font>

50
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:59,680
feel valued<font color="#CCCCCC"> here so thank you some</font>

51
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,260
statistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> always my job to sort of give</font>

52
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,430
my summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to read them</font>

53
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:09,910
all but it was surprising to me that we

54
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:14,280
had 969<font color="#CCCCCC"> patrick one we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this little</font>

55
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:18,310
inside but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was a little nervous</font>

56
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,220
frankly that coming into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week we</font>

57
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,560
were under what I thought registration

58
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,109
would be but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> went over 900</font>

59
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:30,220
significantly which is why Patrick one

60
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:32,440
in the bedding contest not surprising if

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:35,920
you look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the statistics to</font>

62
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:40,209
see that attendance at nanog NCT and

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:44,140
juniper core value sets I think are back

64
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:46,000
home providers and hardware gear someone

65
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,839
asked a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about the trout thank</font>

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,970
you the travel situation I think for

67
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,100
nanog the impact of the travel band

68
00:03:53,970 --> 00:04:00,880
travel legislation before us is really

69
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">for folks getting to us given most of</font>

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,599
our meetings and our purposes in North

71
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:07,720
America we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going you have a</font>

72
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:10,420
travel<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in the US but it could</font>

73
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the in attendance because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do have 22</font>

74
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:18,399

75
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to our meeting we don't do I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vary</font>

76
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,659
down into the statistics but of course

77
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,940
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any band and any one</font>

78
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:30,370
country over another but it does speak

79
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:36,520
to the vast coverage of the community

80
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:39,250
that we serve oh I get the word weapon a

81
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:42,940
little bit of demographics I made the

82
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:45,220
slide bigger this time it gives you some

83
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:50,160
indication of who's here at the meeting

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we see that there's a lot of sectors</font>

85
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,370
self-defined but if you compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

86
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:59,770
chart to history we're still very true

87
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:05,230
to serving the industries that we have

88
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:08,200
