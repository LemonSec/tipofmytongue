00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,960
hi good afternoon and this is basically

2
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">a project that started because of a</font>

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,550
young George good friend of mine and he

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:21,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">was talking to people and they were</font>

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:26,050
wondering about magic for and the effect

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:30,849
on earth once both service providers and

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:34,239
web<font color="#CCCCCC"> holsters so what's the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

8
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">different protocols but we seem more and</font>

9
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,089
more networks where I beliefs takes only

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:42,040
is run with nat64 so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is mostly</font>

11
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,670
mobile operators are doing it these days

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,170
android has<font color="#E5E5E5"> 46 for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> excess and apple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">use explain their net fixed for</font>

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:53,230
detection but some people do really

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:56,669
strange stuff to their website<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there</font>

16
00:00:53,230 --> 00:01:01,239
are cases where things just break so

17
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,280
what do content providers know about the

18
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,979
effect of what they host on people

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,360
visiting their services from behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> mad</font>

20
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:12,760
64 and people who are willing to deploy

21
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,830
at 64 they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font>

22
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,420
okay if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> deployed this technology</font>

23
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,539
what's the effects going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on our</font>

24
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:24,700
users so that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we started doing</font>

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:27,670
some testing it got started by young

26
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">works for intern Society and his own</font>

27
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Institute and and me doing the the</font>

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:38,260
programming and my girlfriend doing the

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:41,890
the logo it's basically built on young a

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,880
gnat 64<font color="#CCCCCC"> testbed he has a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> setup where he</font>

31
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,200
has different metrics for

32
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,500
implementations from different vendors

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:49,689
and people can just type in the right

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,310
dns server in their system and try them

35
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:55,270
all out and compare them to each other

36
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:58,930
and see what the effects are so it's a

37
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:01,990
public test of this everybody can use it

38
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:05,710
it's completely open and here's a setup

39
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:08,960
using 8 a 10 boxes he has follow all the

40
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,690
boxes yes jewel software implementation

41
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,580
Cisco running so everybody who want to

42
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,200
test with<font color="#E5E5E5"> nat64</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just use one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

43
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,990
setups all the instructions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,450
there for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website tester we built</font>

45
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:27,530
and we're using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> jewel implementation</font>

46
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:30,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the third one on this list this is</font>

47
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:33,050
the cluster in<font color="#E5E5E5"> yarm data center he lives</font>

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,090
really close to a to a telco pop and

49
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,790
just has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of racks with lots and</font>

50
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,700
lots of equipment and all the different

51
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:42,890
implementations of for example metrics

52
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:46,119
for there so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea on</font>

53
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:48,829
on the seller the hardware running on

54
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:52,610
now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the biggest</font>

55
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:55,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem some people put really really</font>

56
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,800
strange stuff in their dns and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

57
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:00,440
maybe they're the requirements are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,360
customers say you have to support v6 so

59
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,329
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> just put some random quad a record</font>

60
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,560
in just to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me the requirement or they</font>

61
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,160
just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what they're doing but</font>

62
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,380
we've seen things with<font color="#CCCCCC"> CA before maps</font>

63
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:15,980
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> is there we've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> link-local</font>

64
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,820
addresses in<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns we've actually seen the</font>

65
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:23,780
nat64 address of the the 64 ff9<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

66
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:27,260
version we've seen the documentation

67
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,420
prefixes in there there must<font color="#CCCCCC"> be more</font>

68
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">than just this but we've seen really</font>

69
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:35,000
really strange stuff and there's a

70
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">really big problem with this and it's</font>

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,190
called happy eyeballs the happy eyeballs

72
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,980
algorithm for a dual<font color="#CCCCCC"> specs visitor falls</font>

73
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,290
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to before really quickly so even if</font>

74
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,140
somebody puts junk in there v6 dns

75
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,000
records<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat nobody notices because</font>

76
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:53,179
everything just falls back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> before and</font>

77
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,220
it just looks right to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer so</font>

78
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:58,460
even when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who really bad stuff in</font>

79
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:02,359
their dns for most people it will it'll

80
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,740
still just work of course if you're

81
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">visiting from a v6 only environment or</font>

82
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:12,110
such as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a one that uses nat64 you only</font>

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,730
have v6 so you will not fall back with

84
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,070
happy I ball to the v4 address you will

85
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,870
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep you using the v6 records</font>

86
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,858
and if that one's broken the website

87
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,520
will just be broken so for normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual</font>

88
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">stack custom</font>

89
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:31,159
first this stuff isn't the problem for

90
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:34,250
netflix for networks it is so this is

91
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:38,210
one example is really confusing because

92
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,370
with www you get proper before addresses

93
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:45,198
if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> type the domain name without</font>

94
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:48,039
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> www you actually get the old 036</font>

95
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,419
address which makes no<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense whatsoever</font>

96
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:56,750
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is stuff you can actually see</font>

97
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:58,609
in real life so what what happens if you

98
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:00,919
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run an ad 64 network</font>

99
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,740
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a net DNS 64 server that does</font>

100
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,409
vns mapping and you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

101
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,180
configure it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ignore certain v6</font>

102
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:10,669
addresses just pretend they don't exist

103
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:13,370
and just provide an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethics for mapping</font>

104
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:16,609
as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those as well so even the way if</font>

105
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:18,680
the website<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a v6</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quad a records just</font>

106
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:21,099
ignore<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just use the D for records and</font>

107
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">mess with that because v6 is broken and</font>

108
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:26,139
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of how you can do that you</font>

109
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:29,419
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say okay we have dns 64 in bind</font>

110
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:32,300
but you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just exclude for example</font>

111
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:37,310
everything that's outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the 2003</font>

112
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:39,830
range so this would fix it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your</font>

113
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,500
customer so if you're deploying nat64

114
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,508
this is what you want to do but of

115
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,090
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our test case then we don't</font>

116
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:51,020
want this we actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show the</font>

117
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:55,190
cases where it breaks so in our setup we

118
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,490
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't take this what you also</font>

119
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,669
need is the break be in effect a bit and

120
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:05,409
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the NSX is made for</font>

121
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:07,969
protecting the domain data<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a DNS data</font>

122
00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:10,969
except what you're doing with the DNS 64

123
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:13,009
is creating take records so that's

124
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:16,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what dns egg is trying to</font>

125
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:18,710
prevent so if you are doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns fix</font>

126
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:22,130
form and mapping you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to</font>

127
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:24,080
break a break dns x otherwise it won't

128
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,830
create mapping records for dns x

129
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,990
timezone so it's a it's a bit ugly and

130
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:33,440
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explorer is not the nicest</font>

131
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,240
technology but it used a lot in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

132
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,860
this is what you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with if</font>

133
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,400
you use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll show you some examples</font>

134
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,040
of of different cases where websites

135
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,239
break in the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> scenarios this</font>

136
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:51,530
one for example the website about

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:54,920
firewalls still waiting for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> timeout</font>

138
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:57,710
nothing's happening and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

139
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:00,980
turns out this website<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really secure</font>

140
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:04,700
on v6 and because they're a quad a

141
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:07,580
record is colon colon<font color="#E5E5E5"> ffff kollam some</font>

142
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,979
IP address so on v6 it will never work

143
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,530
and in our net<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 a test case like i</font>

144
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,660
said if your if your<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual stack you're a</font>

145
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,659
happy I both implementation your browser

146
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,430
will just try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect with v6 they</font>

147
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,730
won't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response in 200 milliseconds</font>

148
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,040
it'll fall back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> before problem solved</font>

149
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:30,140
but on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 64 is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will just break and it</font>

150
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:32,870
will wait for that time out another case

151
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:35,419
we've seen the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Annette is good web</font>

152
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,400
server does respond to 36 except on

153
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,620
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get the website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and on v6 you</font>

154
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,919
get a hello world page or a simple error

155
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:47,510
message or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

156
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:49,849
know it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too common as</font>

157
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,530
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people configure the DNS and they</font>

158
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,560
configure the web server but they don't

159
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,239
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put on the right website and</font>

160
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,150
one of the reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this happens is</font>

161
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,300
that people especially the north of many

162
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:05,000
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are v4 only and they do the</font>

163
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,610
web<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosting on v6 but the office network</font>

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,230
is tools before the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> running the</font>

165
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,330
monitoring tools run it from a v4

166
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:16,669
network so they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even notice if</font>

167
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're v6 setup is groping and there's</font>

168
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:21,950
another example<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually a</font>

169
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:24,410
geolocation based on before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the</font>

170
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,820
real website on v6 you do get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

171
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,350
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't show you any content</font>

172
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,990
because the content it depends on

173
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:33,070
geolocation and apparently they don't

174
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,260
properly do geolocation on aunty six so

175
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,580
v6 website just can't give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> any data</font>

176
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,990
because it can't determine where you're

177
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,969
coming from this is actually confusing

178
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:45,710
one I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why this happened but</font>

179
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:47,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was a website</font>

180
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,090
that didn't have a four day<font color="#CCCCCC"> record so it</font>

181
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,219
was before<font color="#CCCCCC"> only but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we access it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

182
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:56,450
the nat64 gateway we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

184
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,870
is your apache web server page so this

185
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:05,449
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a confusing one because it shouldn't</font>

186
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:07,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">even notice that it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different so it</font>

187
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,530
should have just worked and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I still have</font>

188
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to debug this one see what the what the</font>

189
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:15,650
underlying reason it but it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

190
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:19,280
cases we<font color="#E5E5E5"> run into now this is also an</font>

191
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:22,340
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> one and this one shows what</font>

192
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:29,720
a website where the main website runs on

193
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:31,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">36 and it does a emerges and all the a</font>

194
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,610
lot of styling<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff like that are</font>

195
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:38,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually coming from a v4 only server so</font>

196
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:41,060
the website runs partially on v6 only so

197
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,339
on normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> I before it just works on that</font>

198
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,760
64<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works because nat64 just make sure</font>

199
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:50,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4 content is accessible both</font>

200
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,370
on ipv6 only the main website works with

201
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,260
all the images are broken this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

202
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:56,450
sad<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean this website could very</font>

203
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,960
easily be completely v6 accessible if

204
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:05,690
they fix those images so getting there

205
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:07,400
but not all not quite and say same

206
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:09,530
example is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> here it's not the images</font>

207
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,990
but it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the CSS styling at</font>

208
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:19,760
that's missing so content of the website

209
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:22,490
works but just plain old HTML and like<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

210
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,130
said if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put in a broken for a record</font>

211
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,330
you get broken websites in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> indie</font>

212
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">setups this is actually a screenshot</font>

213
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the test site already and in the</font>

214
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,250
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the before only one on</font>

215
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:37,610
the left you see the nat64 version on

216
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:39,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to see the v6 only version and</font>

217
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how it works just</font>

218
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:43,160
put in a URL<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can see screenshots</font>

219
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,100
from the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> version side by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

220
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,910
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what what the result</font>

221
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,910
would be for a user

222
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:59,300
this this this one is actually you can

223
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,820
if you see at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom right you see</font>

224
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,010
the one percent in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the bar which</font>

225
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,990
basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the web server</font>

226
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:11,330
responded to a two v6 and then it either

227
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,460
redirected to some other a URL or

228
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:16,160
something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that one broke</font>

229
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:20,000
so the first URL works but<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

230
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,530
after that is broken you can see it in

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,470
the bottom you can see all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the resources</font>

232
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,660
and you can see on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fourth line it</font>

233
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:29,090
says it says bad gateway which basically

234
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,250
the feedback we got from our proxy

235
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:34,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that said ok sorry but I can't</font>

236
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:40,460
access it so probably a redirect to a v4

237
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:41,630
on the domain and visible but what it

238
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,420
looks like if you actually look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

239
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,340
resources you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on before</font>

240
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:49,189
only an ethics for most of the resources

241
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:52,610
all the images and<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSS stylesheets all</font>

242
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:59,240
of that works on v6 only it starts well

243
00:11:52,610 --> 00:12:01,700
but then breaks so what are all the

244
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,290
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> were actually testing well like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

245
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,240
said we're testing on that 64 we're

246
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,980
testing on v6 only because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

247
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,290
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though it wasn't part of the</font>

248
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:10,760
original<font color="#E5E5E5"> question and it's really</font>

249
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:14,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to test that because that's</font>

250
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately where we want to go and and</font>

251
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,020
then we we spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time looking at</font>

252
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,630
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> different things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we could test</font>

253
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:24,130
we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with with just seeing if</font>

254
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,689
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the main URL got us an HTML page</font>

255
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,460
but then you go okay but what if there's

256
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">redirects whether there is what about</font>

257
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:35,120
the images what about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the resources so</font>

258
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:38,180
in in the end what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did is test test</font>

259
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,860
all of them we we run a browser we make

260
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,160
screenshots of every different version

261
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,260
we keep track of all the URLs at xs and

262
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,569
try to match them together and compare

263
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:52,610
and compare them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's basically</font>

264
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:55,790
the service we we build so it's a

265
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,650
netflix for a check<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

266
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:00,439
basically go there you get get get this

267
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:02,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">image you can even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> filter on like for</font>

268
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">example you only want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see a size that</font>

269
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,640
perform well on ipv6

270
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:10,820
the test cases and you just put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> URL</font>

271
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,960
and you get this result like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said in</font>

272
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle you see the before only</font>

273
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,170
websites that one should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fine I mean</font>

274
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:18,590
we're assuming that people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually</font>

275
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:20,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">testing their before set up and then we</font>

276
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:24,140
we use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a baseline to test to</font>

277
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:27,530
look at the other two cases it's like I

278
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:30,260

279
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:32,600
move the mouse over the over the

280
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:35,300
screenshot you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get an overlay</font>

281
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,820
image that shows the differences so as

282
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,040
you can see these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite similar but</font>

283
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:43,670
the big image in the eighth missing on

284
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,589
the net 641 and if you move the mouse

285
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,719
over the over the left part<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

286
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:49,550
actually show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in high contrast the</font>

287
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,860
differences between the image and the

288
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:54,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump out so you can really</font>

289
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:57,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">easily see what's going on some of the</font>

290
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:59,030
test cases are much less obvious like it

291
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,680
says oh there's a there's only eighty

292
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,420
percent match between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> websites and</font>

293
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">they look quite similar but it turns out</font>

294
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,750
that because of some image loading

295
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,100
problems that one of them is actually

296
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,690
three pixels lower than the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

297
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,910
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so even those</font>

298
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:16,550
changes get get picked up by the system

299
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:19,339
like I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our in normal nat64</font>

300
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:21,709
scenarios you really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix the</font>

301
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:25,700
broken as you fix records if people put

302
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:28,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">junk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dns you have to fix it for</font>

303
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,810
your users because otherwise you're

304
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,490
getting too many complaints people will

305
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:34,189
call the helpdesk and that'll cost money

306
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:37,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">so most networks actively running an</font>

307
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,890
ethics for setup will usually put in

308
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:42,800
some filters to filter out the broken

309
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:45,920
for a record in this setup we explicitly

310
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,530
didn't do that so we if something is

311
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,270
wrong we'll just let it break better to

312
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:52,730
show a broken website in case somebody

313
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:59,720
just takes confidence that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

314
00:14:52,730 --> 00:15:03,110
their setup is working<font color="#CCCCCC"> so technically</font>

315
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,510
how do we actually build it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's</font>

316
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,130
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cluster of servers so we have</font>

317
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:09,470
a management server with a weapon<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

318
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,180
face so that I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just shown you we have</font>

319
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,430
a server<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has only before we have</font>

320
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:17,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the server that has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only be six we have</font>

321
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:22,010
a server<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only v6 with nat64</font>

322
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:24,380
in front of it and depending on we

323
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:27,500
accept two setups one is running a young

324
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,730
lab one is run in my lab we are all

325
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,300
running this business of course on

326
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:34,490
virtual machines we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> phantom jf which</font>

327
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,170
is a command-line browser doesn't have a

328
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,570
graphical interface which you can

329
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:40,849
completely script it so what we do is we

330
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,910
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL we get debugging output for</font>

331
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:46,030
all the requested sends out then we

332
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,680
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it take a screenshot</font>

333
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,120
export the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screenshot and then we load</font>

334
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,670
everything together do all the

335
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:57,470
comparisons and and try to give some

336
00:15:52,670 --> 00:16:00,170
meaningful results from from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

337
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,730
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is how it works a couple</font>

338
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,610
of servers so I'm connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see for</font>

339
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:08,270
some connected to v six men management

340
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:11,120
services controls all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them and yeah</font>

341
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:13,460
just feel free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use it just go to the</font>

342
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,310
website type in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> URL you can type in</font>

343
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,960
any URL it's not just the in the

344
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,390
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could only do like the main</font>

345
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> homepage but now you can just put in</font>

346
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:25,670
any URL run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> test rerun it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

347
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,530
want and so especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you put in</font>

348
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,050
your your website and you see some

349
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,670
errors try to fix them rerun the<font color="#CCCCCC"> test</font>

350
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:36,560
and try to get everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to a</font>

351
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:38,060
hundred percent success rate when you

352
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,189
run the<font color="#E5E5E5"> test it might take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a while</font>

353
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,689
before it actually shows results but

354
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:43,010
that's because we're testing quite a lot

355
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of websites and they're all in the queue</font>

356
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:48,020
so once you type in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the URL it will be</font>

357
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:51,350
put in the queue it will show you when

358
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:54,740
the test will start<font color="#E5E5E5"> a schedule when it's</font>

359
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:56,630
starting and hopefully after a couple of

360
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:03,260
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

361
00:16:56,630 --> 00:17:05,689
results so start start testing make sure

362
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:08,180
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> website isn't broken in these cases</font>

363
00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,339
I'm sure that most of you will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

364
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem with it because I hope you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

365
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,419
understand how the internet works and

366
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,920
how that you shouldn't put bad stuff in

367
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,350
quality records and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

368
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:22,250
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is something</font>

369
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:24,169
useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a for a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people and we</font>

370
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,689
also provide all the all the debug

371
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:27,490
output so if you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

372
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:30,550
you can

373
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:31,840
open the resources page and there's

374
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a link that shows you all the</font>

375
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,399
debug output from the web browser so if

376
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,020
they're strange javascript errors<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font>

377
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:44,440
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> who'll be visible if you if you</font>

378
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:46,570
want to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and I see that actually</font>

379
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,030
I'm speaking way too quickly and I'm

380
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:52,659
already done<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11 minutes before before my</font>

381
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,889
deadline so any questions on this what

382
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,870
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is this something useful</font>

383
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:59,020
should we expand it should we do all the

384
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:01,409
other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you surprised by the</font>

385
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,410
results

386
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,100
I don't see anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> running up to the</font>

387
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,100
microphone

388
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,110
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's much more important than</font>

389
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,110
asking me questions

390
