my<font color="#CCCCCC"> way through it and this is going to</font>

11
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:38,160
be huge so so is there an easy way to

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,660
evaluate<font color="#CCCCCC"> ixp benefits there's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,390
of conversation in the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,089
how can we tell if the benefits from an

16
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,450
the intangible benefits about

<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot those are really important but</font>

19
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,629
they're also really hard to measure

20
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:56,820
there's no easy way to say what the

21
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:58,079
benefit of participating in an IXP gives

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,460
you in terms of picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the phone and</font>

calling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you appear and saying hey let's</font>

intangibles as well are also extremely

26
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,160

27
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:09,960
focused on on kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bean counter</font>

28

like numbers in excel they really tell

you lots of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and help</font>

51
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:04,649
lot better than kind of by the seat of

52
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:06,629
the pants so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is NP v NP v is a</font>

53
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:08,940
financial calculation its net present

54
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:11,310
value it can bear it compares an

55
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,220
investment today against the present

56
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,290
value of cash flow as well into the

57
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,650
future and discounted by a rate<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

58
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,060
return you may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard the term the</font>

59
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,010
discount rate or the yield

60
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,630
that's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you use this money</font>

61
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,819
to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else what would the</font>

62
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,680
expected benefit be and you need to

63
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,880
subtract that expected benefit from the

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,430
benefits that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to calculate</font>

65
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:33,989
in order to establish if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> either</font>

66
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:38,130
a net neutral or a positive business

67
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:39,269
case so in the modeling the building of

68
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:42,060
the calculations is fairly

69
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,500
straightforward I take all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> capital</font>

70
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,750
expenditures and roll them<font color="#E5E5E5"> up into a</font>

71
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,849
number and depreciate them over a period

72
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,090
I take all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effects and roll that</font>

73
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:53,310
into a monthly recurring number i take

74
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,080
ideal the calculation called effective

75
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:56,670
megabits<font color="#CCCCCC"> I take what it cost me to</font>

76
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,340
actually deliver those bits over the

77
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:01,440
exchange<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then I compared effective</font>

78
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,630
megabit against transit and come up with

79
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,400
a discount megabit and that's how i'm

80
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:07,500
calculating my future cash flows and<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

81
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,480
benefits from the I XP so if I can

82
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,630
deliver bit it's cheaper across the

83
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,940
exchange then I can / transit without

84
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,709
all the intangibles of course I have a

85
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:20,700
wind and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a method to actually do</font>

86
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:23,190
an analysis so let's play and to work

87
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,359
within the constructs of the room I'm

88
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,350
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Allison and we're</font>

89
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,320
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we're going to bring up the</font>

90
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:29,880
model<font color="#E5E5E5"> and please don't don't modify this</font>

91
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,030
while I'm talking you'll make me look

92
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,079
really stupid because you'll and you'll

93
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:37,920
piss off a lot of IX peas as well so I'm

94
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,470
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to walk through this really</font>

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,358
quickly we compounded bandwidth growth

96
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,970
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we needed some number</font>

97
00:03:42,359 --> 00:03:47,370
for growth going forward and what I

98
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,440
model here is worth case based business

99
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,959
case and best you always want to have a

100
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,609
worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> your worst cost the worst</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font>

101
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:56,010
expenses that<font color="#CCCCCC"> your that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you that you</font>

102
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:57,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">might experience your basis maybe what</font>

103
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,819
you're looking at today and<font color="#E5E5E5"> your best</font>

104
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,060
could be your negotiating point if we

105
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,700
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> move down a little bit router port</font>

106
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,459
switch ports this is my accumulation of

107
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,738
capital there's my investment this is

108
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,170
what I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allocate in order to</font>

participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the exchange point I</font>

110
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:17,039
build my depreciation from that as you

111
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,510
know when you spend money<font color="#E5E5E5"> on assets they</font>

112
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:21,389
get logged to the books and they'd

113
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,789
appreciate over time not immediately and

114
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:25,800
using the depreciation built into the

115
00:04:23,789 --> 00:04:29,310
expenses as a measure to get to cash

116

XD port fees are not indicative of any

119
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:39,599
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain in particular but I did build</font>

120
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,599
debate the worst case the base in the

121
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:45,210
best case as you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i pick 1500 is</font>

122
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:48,000
my target but if you when you go look at

123
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,609
the model there's a cell at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of</font>

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,319
the spreadsheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's utilization and</font>

125
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,330
that's the sweet spot the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

126
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,879
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to play</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with to figure out what</font>

127
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,469
your break even in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst case base</font>

128
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,819
case in best case because this model is

129
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:03,240
if we can go down a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more</font>

130
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:04,680
please so there's are appearing effects

131
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,139
there's our net monthly recurring

132
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,720
expenses a function of effects and

133
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:13,319
depreciation and here's our NPV

134
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,539
calculation so npv is looking at cash

135
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,090
flows based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the discount megabit that</font>

136
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">i explained previously it takes into</font>

137
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,690
account the discount rate the expected

138
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,970
yield that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be different for</font>

139
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,110
every company I heard one company tell

140
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,840
me that when they do these<font color="#E5E5E5"> calculations</font>

141
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,719
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their bean counters advise them to</font>

142
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,030
use twenty percent for my purposes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

143
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:34,169
think ten percent is more consistent

144
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,719
there are others that would think that

145
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,719
three is<font color="#E5E5E5"> more consistent you you decide</font>

differences in semi excuse negotiate and

180
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,570
you should use this as a negotiating

always model the<font color="#E5E5E5"> worst case scenarios so</font>

that when you present your findings to

00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,280
your colleagues and your bean counters

188
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,979
but you thought about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know how</font>

able to get the best results that you

good again<font color="#CCCCCC"> port fees I've discussed that</font>

193
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,090
and then accounting for intangibles I

194
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:39,290
talked to build Norton about this and

195
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:40,969
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy distribution matters for</font>

196
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,640
some networks and for some it doesn't

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:45,800
there are things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like golden packets</font>

198
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,750
that it may not matter if peering is a

199
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,570

winner I played<font color="#E5E5E5"> around with yield as as</font>

201
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:56,480
a discount for the impact of intangibles

202
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,610
and if you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font>

203
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,990
this hard make the yield<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero and see</font>

204
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,550
what the business case looks like and

205
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,290
use that to account for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intangibles</font>

206
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,150
but there has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a better way I just</font>
