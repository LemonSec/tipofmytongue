00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:11,290
her next lightning talk of job<font color="#CCCCCC"> Snyder</font>

2
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:16,990
presenting on

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:18,689
indication thank you my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> joke</font>

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,150
Snyder's I work for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntt communications</font>

5
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:24,130
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here today to share with you</font>

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:26,560
some work we've been doing over the last

7
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:31,360
few months to make your operational

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:33,640
lives easier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we will specifically</font>

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:38,920
focus on the aspect of communication

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:41,640
between ebgp neighbors all of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">ebgp sessions and these sessions can be</font>

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,050
considered the wire between two tin cans

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:50,830
and although it is beautiful<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

14
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">pronounce announcements from our site</font>

15
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:56,790
through your site or vice versa there

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,970
are a few tiny things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lacking</font>

17
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:02,829
for instance if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not entirely sure</font>

18
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,809
who is on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wire and</font>

19
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,329
that could easily happen at public

20
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:09,220
internet exchanges or because parts of

21
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:11,559
your administration were lost<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago when you migrated from this database</font>

23
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:18,640
to that database so we're left<font color="#E5E5E5"> with very</font>

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:22,120
few actual communication mechanisms

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,430
between ebgp neighbors one thing you

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:29,890
could do is you could slap the session

27
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:36,190
or use optical signals like their peer

28
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:38,520
are you there what's up Mike oh I'm joke

29
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:38,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh</font>

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,199
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the game last</font>

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:49,360
Sunday and then if the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys hold</font>

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,610
silence then either he did it like the

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,149
game or<font color="#CCCCCC"> there some issue between the two</font>

34
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:56,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you technical issue and this</font>

35
00:01:55,149 --> 00:02:00,220
especially becomes apparent with

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,799
maintenance we announced to our

37
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,500
customers dear customer two weeks from

38
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">now will reboot this device there will</font>

39
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,060
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 minutes of downtime this is the</font>

40
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:13,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">tracking ID this is where you can call</font>

41
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knock and etc and then two</font>

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,560
weeks later when the session actually

43
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:21,010
goes down customers will email the knock

44
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,410
and and be like why is the session down

45
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:24,850
dude and then you show them the

46
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:27,400
notification you set them two weeks

47
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,799
prior they're like oh oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot to add</font>

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,390
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my calendar invites first time</font>

49
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,730
this happens as well we get maintenance

50
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:36,579
notifications from other peers and we

51
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:40,420
are not always<font color="#E5E5E5"> as disciplined as we</font>

52
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:44,640
should be in that regard<font color="#CCCCCC"> so to enhance</font>

53
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:47,950
this specific aspect of BHP operations I

54
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,839
and two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my friends we we dove into</font>

55
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:55,119
the ITF nerd to<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent the beach p</font>

56
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,910
protocol in such a way that when you

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,079
shut down a beach p session you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop</font>

58
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:06,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">a tiny message in the pierce syslog or</font>

59
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:09,519
whatever mechanism he uses and the way

60
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:12,430
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is in the beach p protocol</font>

61
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,560
you have a cease notification and this

62
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:17,019
is the message<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is sent to the</font>

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,220
neighbor when the session<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about to go</font>

64
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:24,549
down and it sees notification as a crude

65
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:28,930
extensibility in that you can just

66
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:31,180
append data through that message and in

67
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,470
some versions of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> seas notification</font>

68
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,510
this is used to for instance indicate

69
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:39,970
some information about y<font color="#CCCCCC"> MX prefix</font>

70
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,980
limitless<font color="#CCCCCC"> trips or what caused the</font>

71
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:45,790
problem and what we've done here is

72
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:49,410
we've extended the shutdown event and

73
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:54,170
the reset agent that you can have up to

74
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:58,000
128 bytes worth of communication message

75
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,530
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular beach p message and</font>

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,980
this is really neat because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it built</font>

77
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:07,550
upon an existing<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP message type so</font>

78
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:10,250
from a protocol design perspective it's

79
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,290
kind of it's a small change is we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

80
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,330
we're not changing<font color="#E5E5E5"> beach p in a</font>

81
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:16,370
significant way it is backwards

82
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:19,519
compatible in the sense that existing

83
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:21,530
speakers will not act weird when they

84
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:26,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive this data because the session</font>

85
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:29,570
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down anyway so that's that's</font>

86
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,450
all quite nice and what this looks like

87
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:35,330
I'm for instance openbsd will already

88
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:38,270
support this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just type on the</font>

89
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,669
command line this neighbor needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

90
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:43,340
disabled and I can append that short

91
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:46,159
message for instance this is the ticket

92
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:48,799
ID we're upgrading and we'll be back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

93
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,889
30 minutes and what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would look like</font>

94
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,380
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiving side is you have the</font>

95
00:04:51,889 --> 00:04:57,740
syslog message that says hey the session

96
00:04:54,380 --> 00:05:00,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">is now down and next to that is a</font>

97
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,020
message that<font color="#CCCCCC"> contains my shut down</font>

98
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,919
communication which I sensitive specific

99
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:10,669
here and this I think will greatly

100
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:15,770
enhance our operations in the peering

101
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:21,409
world this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe what it could look</font>

102
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:23,659
like on juniper or on cisco iOS XR when

103
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:26,990
you clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> a session maybe this is what</font>

104
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:31,130
it will look like so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

105
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,169
implementation the ITF still has that

106
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,850
attitude that put your coat where your

107
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,549
mouth is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can progress</font>

108
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,090
things through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ITF much easier then</font>

109
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:45,979
if you have nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show for so</font>

110
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:49,849
openbsd has this implemented go bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> TMX</font>

111
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:52,340
the traffic analyzed engine X a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP as</font>

112
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,610
it and there are decoders for Wireshark

113
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,159
and tcpdump available for protocol

114
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:00,700
designers to debug this particular

115
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,919
extension to the beach p protocol and

116
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:07,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> heard positive feedback from birth</font>

117
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,049
a famous route surfer application

118
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:12,300
cisco iOS XR has showed some interest

119
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,990
the Juniper people have showed some

120
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:18,930
interest and from Nokia as well Eifert

121
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:22,530
positive feedback so this doesn't mean

122
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,980
they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually build it this means</font>

123
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:28,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need to email your account managers</font>

124
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,920
point them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation and say</font>

125
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,780
their account manager could you please

126
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:37,620
implement this feature<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it looks</font>

127
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:40,679
useful to me and the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sight</font>

128
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:42,480
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations these vendors if</font>

129
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,420
they receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> from multiple customers</font>

130
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:48,600
feedback that this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful it</font>

131
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:51,750
will be prioritized and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> later this</font>

132
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,360
year will receive these features or and

133
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,350
if not none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you email into the</font>

134
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,020
account managers then perhaps it's 2018

135
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,630
2019 or maybe it will never happen so it

136
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:08,609
really depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys email your</font>

137
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:12,180
account managers and of course because

138
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:15,810
it's 2017 and there's a whole world

139
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:20,160
outside North America that does not use

140
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:24,960
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clean 7-bit ascii stuff it will</font>

141
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,700
support utf-8<font color="#E5E5E5"> and does Unicode that</font>

142
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,000
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your router will</font>

143
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:31,979
actually display these emojis but for

144
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,820
instance X a BGP actually shows the

145
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:37,740
emojis so that's kind of cool but you

146
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">know of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll only use this tool</font>

147
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,510
in a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> professional and serious</font>

148
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:46,280
manner and then you know use ticket<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs</font>

149
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:52,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">and operationally relevant information</font>

150
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:57,750
and so the shutdown communication it is

151
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:59,670
128 bytes max this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent visual</font>

152
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,610
spoofing because it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

153
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,230
annoying<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's half your syslog turned</font>

154
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,940
out to be there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down</font>

155
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:08,790
communication<font color="#E5E5E5"> message from a malicious</font>

156
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:12,390
actor by<font color="#CCCCCC"> keeping the message short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

157
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:16,010
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> will make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it more easier to</font>

158
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:16,010
grukk for our operations

159
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,669
that's it are there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any questions</font>

160
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:34,779
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago two thousand nine or</font>

161
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:37,718
so who are you oh my Lenny Giuliano

162
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:42,360
juniper there was a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

163
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:45,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to this bgp administrative</font>

164
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:49,449
information something like that where

165
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:53,739
you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> send text any text google</font>

166
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:55,560
perhaps mean the advisory dress yes

167
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:59,949
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I successor the</font>

168
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:03,609
operational message draft yeah you know

169
00:08:59,949 --> 00:09:06,790
I didn't see that but is this a similar

170
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:09,250
idea just<font color="#E5E5E5"> at shut down time or whatever</font>

171
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,189
happened to that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> certainly are</font>

172
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,630
similarities between the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> efforts</font>

173
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:17,139
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one has more</font>

174
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,630
implementations so that's useful and it

175
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:23,319
doesn't define a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> VP message type and</font>

176
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:25,509
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that by introducing a new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

177
00:09:23,319 --> 00:09:28,120
message type in the eye dr worker group

178
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:33,339
idea is responsible for the bgp protocol

179
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,699
it it's kind of hard to sell such a big

180
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:39,220
modifications to the protocol and this

181
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:42,849
beach p<font color="#CCCCCC"> shut down communication it just</font>

182
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,480
really finds<font color="#E5E5E5"> existing positions in the</font>

183
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:47,949
the protocol so to speak so<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

184
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,149
protocol design perspective this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

185
00:09:47,949 --> 00:09:55,750
a tiny change whereas the other efforts

186
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:59,139
were very big chunks of work that filter

187
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:01,630
get consensus and momentum but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way</font>

188
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:04,449
they are similar this extension only

189
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,459
works at shut down time or recess which

190
00:10:04,449 --> 00:10:08,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">i figure would be the starting point</font>

191
00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:13,229
because that's where you need that

192
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:13,230
additional information most clearly

193
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,550
crystal field sales force I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

194
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,980
and was exactly the same question<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

195
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,219
which was this is obviously tied to a

196
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,769
shutdown is there any perceived

197
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:30,550
usefulness to having a free-form message

198
00:10:26,769 --> 00:10:34,540
type that is outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a BGP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shutdown</font>

199
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:37,240
event it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is certainly worth discussing</font>

200
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,689
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in touch with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offers of</font>

201
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font>

202
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,510
a price redraft that will start<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

203
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,270
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago the intent is that</font>

204
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">we first finish this work and if there</font>

205
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:52,550
is if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't address all our</font>

206
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:55,790
operational needs then we'll attempt to

207
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:58,699
formulate a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to send a message while</font>

208
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,760
the session is up and not down but we

209
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:04,040
flip<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two efforts in that regard as</font>

210
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,780
say risk distribution yeah this

211
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">definitely appears to be lower hanging</font>

212
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:13,780
fruit and excellent progress thank you

213
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:13,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by tying us up goodbye</font>
