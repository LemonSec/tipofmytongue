00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,300
to talk a little bit about policy and

why I'm hoping you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially right</font>

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,610
found an organization that focuses on

policy work for companies that rack and

25
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:13,440

that we're going to illustrate are

the government's looking at cyber

security right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to talk</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about what the US government considers</font>

65

are changing right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cybersecurity</font>

67
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:52,230
regulation is changing in great part

68
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:54,750
because they're taking a very close look

69
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,399
at how the internet needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be governed</font>

70
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,590
as critical infrastructure so we're

71
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about what that means</font>

72
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,040
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about how the NIST</font>

73
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,560
cybersecurity framework plays a role in

74
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,179
new requirements and how internet

75
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:12,180
providers can take an active role in

76
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:14,190
ensuring the good decisions get made so

77
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:17,430
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> brief overview of why this</font>

78
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,800
stuff is really important right now in

79
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,750
late 2016<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and house and Energy</font>

80
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,910
and Commerce Committee began a series of

81
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,890
cybersecurity hearings in response to

82
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,320
IOT security problems we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

83
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:31,950
about that for a while<font color="#CCCCCC"> now the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> diné</font>

84
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:34,500
incident basically started a cascade of

85
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,660
legislators who wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

86
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,640
answers to why you couldn't get the

87
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,410
banking websites and things that they

88
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:48,480
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure we're up and running</font>

89
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:50,730
and then there was the Russian hacking

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,920
incident with our elections and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in early</font>

91
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,440
2017 the US Senate Armed Services

92
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,510
Committee followed suit and they started

93
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,329
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearings to talk about what we</font>

94
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:02,040
needed to do about cybersecurity so it

95
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:06,150
started putting the kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

96
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,920
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we operate on the hot</font>

97
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,980
seat to start having<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversations with</font>

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,540
legislators my job is mostly trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

99
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,119
explain to legislators how the internet

100
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,250
works and so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent a lot of time</font>

101
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,120
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> past couple of months trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:23,400
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> people up to speed on top level</font>

103
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,169
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> gen general concepts things</font>

104
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,960
that you'd be like embarrassed to

105
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:31,500
realize that legislators don't

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand those types of things are</font>

107

getting them just this much just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tiny</font>

108
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,550
bit closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to being able to make smart</font>

decision

110
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:45,000
about how we should handle cyber but

111
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,770
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a lot more they need a lot</font>

what that means it starts with the

there's a feeling now that it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

necessarily talk about what we're asking

responsibilities imposed upon them but

208
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,560
the conversations now are how extensive

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,430
the new responsibilities are going to be

210
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,709
and who they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply to like I</font>

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,810
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues</font>

212
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,219
surrounding critical infrastructure so

213
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,420
let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what critical</font>

214
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:02,680
infrastructure is critical

215
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:04,610
infrastructure is a term used by

216
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,899
governments to describe assets that are

217
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">central for the functioning of a society</font>

218
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an economy and hence require special</font>

219
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,100
federal oversight protection and

220
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,320
regulation I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">all 16 critical infrastructure section</font>

222
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,769
sectors<font color="#CCCCCC"> the important thing to note is</font>

223
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:23,689
that like I said my background is not in

224
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,640
the communications sector it's in the

225
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,680
information technology sector but both

226
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:31,699
are extremely relevant and both are

227
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,260
being heavily talked about right now my

228
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:39,500
examples are going to rest in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IT</font>

229
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,550
sector in 1998 the 19 a program was set

230
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:44,779
up for critical infrastructure

231
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:48,250
protection and the DHS had a sector

232
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:52,100
specific agency set up for the IT sector

233
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:55,279
today's IT sector specific plan is

234
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:58,130

is not that we don't want to get engaged

honestly like what will happen is a bill

542

model and in classical economics they're

543
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:39,090
called externalities and it's a classic

544
00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:42,029
role for government to step in and

545
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,738
provide roads police and I'd like to

546
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:47,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank funding for some sorts of open</font>

547
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:49,619

level that is commensurate with the

550
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:54,239
importance of them so that's a lot of

551
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:55,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">words to say do you think there's</font>

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also got to participate in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

557
00:23:06,239 --> 00:23:12,480

<font color="#E5E5E5">with they step it up to the mic and they</font>

559
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,940
talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the idea of addressing IOT</font>

IOT software solution that could that

562
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:29,509
could be that was extremely secure and

563
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:32,489
easy to use that could be a way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive</font>

to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things more stable and secure</font>

565
00:23:32,489 --> 00:23:36,629
from that perspective the answer is

566
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:38,580
there very well may be and it's going to

567
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:40,320
take people in positions like ours

568
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,928
stepping up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say no guys this is the</font>

569
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,269
way that you solve this problem in order

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen one thing that was</font>

in the existing executive order that I
