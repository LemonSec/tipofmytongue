1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:15,600
welcome back yeah thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so yeah and</font>

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,340
again so before we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just talked about</font>

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:19,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like very high level very</font>

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,198
distant future not really technical

5
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,660
details more like giving you an overview

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what's going on there and this time</font>

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:32,220
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just dig really deep into details and</font>

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:35,940
yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pkp GP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plaza is a need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to we</font>

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:39,539
developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea cakes just to solve some</font>

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,390
of our technical issues in terms of what

11
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:46,649
we need for our data analysis so this is

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,949
joint work with two beers and yeah we

13
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:51,750
all know IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintain route service and</font>

14
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:55,019
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're processing a significant</font>

15
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,820
amount of data especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> not probably</font>

16
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,250
the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data which is crucial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,739
but the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information is very</font>

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:06,090
important for XPS all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

19
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:10,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">announcements and yeah if you get</font>

20
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,990
requests from customers you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

21
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,930
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to debug something so customers</font>

22
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,179
asking for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> get weary see we are things</font>

23
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:20,850
going on we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see certain prefixes</font>

24
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:23,040
or why don't don't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept certain</font>

25
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,500
prefixes so sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> you just need a</font>

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,720
debugging because the customers asking

27
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,000
for it or you could imagine of an

28
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,950
historic analysis so for instance my

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,930
boss is stopping<font color="#CCCCCC"> by and saying hey we</font>

30
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,880
got a new peak at the XP is it because

31
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,329
of new routes or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> because it was</font>

32
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,298
more traffic for for some CDN so what so

33
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:44,820
ever and so we need to go and do some

34
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,570
data analysis and see what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on on</font>

35
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,639
the control plane actually the internet

36
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:53,880
is not all good we also have incidents

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,909
so probably someone that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font>

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,579
hijack or some misconfigurations and

39
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:02,340
route leaks and we want to really get

40
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,939
the root cause of it and dig into what's

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,300
going on so therefore<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tool set</font>

42
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:11,640
and since we<font color="#CCCCCC"> add c kicks such as many</font>

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,440
other IXPs we maintain a bird's route

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,600
server which is great software and which

45
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,090
actually works well and does a good job

46
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,840
it also comes with some

47
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:23,700
if it comes to data analysis so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,160
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very limited the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long term</font>

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,379
export of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp information because what I</font>

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,720
actually want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is just switch that</font>

51
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,510
thing off and have a continuous export

52
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,599
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> mr t data for instance which just</font>

53
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,760
never stops really so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can like</font>

54
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,738
even after weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back and look</font>

55
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the data and see what what happens</font>

56
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,780
if someone asks questions so also

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's no simple filtering before the</font>

58
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">mrt exports because sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

59
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to switch it on on demand and just</font>

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,390
have it for certain customer IP or

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,329
whatsoever so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is such a feat that</font>

62
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:02,339
feature doesn't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bird and also</font>

63
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:05,040
no insights into incoming vtp

64
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,220
advertisement so what we see if we use

65
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,500
like like this the commands of bird we

66
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,660
can see which prefixes are there but we

67
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,150
cannot really see what happens before

68
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,160
the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> past election so we're sad</font>

69
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,860
selection happens and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have</font>

70
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,780
a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> but sometimes for debugging or for</font>

71
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,269
really digging into issues it's very

72
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:29,400
important that we also know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

73
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:32,609
went into the roads over so that's why

74
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,530
we just said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay a very easy idea to</font>

75
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,109
overcome that and to really get all the

76
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:41,280
information is just start TCP dump at

77
00:03:37,109 --> 00:03:43,829
the route server port and this since bgp

78
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,980
is just a soft bird is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a software</font>

79
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,900
router this also works for for any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

80
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">setup as well where it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a routed</font>

81
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,780
in and yeah we just capture all the TCPS

82
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,489
and so since then we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have all</font>

83
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,400
the information in place but the issue

84
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:02,370
is you it's very very hard and complex

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,849
to dig into it and filter and look at

86
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,829
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> features so using wireshark or</font>

87
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,649
the command line version<font color="#CCCCCC"> key shark is</font>

88
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,720
very complex and cumbersome the output

89
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,329
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to process in an</font>

90
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,510
automated fashion if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you men managed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

91
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:21,840
get this set up running then you end up

92
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:24,240
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> like line based output which</font>

93
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:26,700
sometimes if you despair is not there

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,130
and like to really automate it's not

95
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:31,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">very nice</font>

96
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:34,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">whilst like that support</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DGP in fact but</font>

97
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,690
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really built for bgp so some fuse</font>

98
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:39,230
are missing you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot really slow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

99
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:43,580
certain fields and like the way it shows

100
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:45,770
the results of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp communities is a big</font>

101
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,260
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> awkward to it what's really a hassle</font>

102
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:52,070
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to deal with it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at some point</font>

103
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:55,010
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just decided to come up with our own</font>

104
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,710
solution and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> call it p kb gb puzzle</font>

105
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:01,370
or short versions<font color="#E5E5E5"> PB gpp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

106
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:04,099
implemented in<font color="#CCCCCC"> python 2007 and runs on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 3</font>

107
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,370
dot X as well it's open source you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

108
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:10,340
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on github it's also there as a</font>

109
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,830
pip so you can simply install it and

110
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,739
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> under apache license to that oh</font>

111
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,620
just on the bottom of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide you see</font>

112
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:21,350
for just in command how it would look

113
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">like with key shark in comparison to our</font>

114
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:27,980
implementation and we try to keep the

115
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:30,890
interface like really straightforward so

116
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:32,720
just a quick give you to quickly give

117
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:35,919
you an overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the features at the</font>

118
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,400
input we<font color="#E5E5E5"> accept the pcap from a file</font>

119
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,170
from standard in and we also do life

120
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:44,630
reading from from the interface actually

121
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:47,360
so and the output<font color="#E5E5E5"> after processing</font>

122
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:52,040
filtering whatever you want to get out

123
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,920
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pcap with which contains</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vgp our</font>

124
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,720
messages is a human readable format

125
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">which because sometimes you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

126
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,030
explore things and just want to see

127
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself and and get your eyes hands on</font>

128
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,690
what's going on sometimes you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

129
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,490
have it in adjacent because you want to

130
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,950
process it later or you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

131
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:14,960
line base because it it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just goes into</font>

132
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:18,890
the next script or whatsoever so we try

133
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">to keep the tool as easy extendable as</font>

134
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:24,260
possible as an object-oriented<font color="#E5E5E5"> code and</font>

135
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:26,740
it's very modular and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we added</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

136
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments to the code so that is not just</font>

137
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,480
like in some software projects which are

138
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,820
theoretically open source<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean they</font>

139
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,800
are open source but we really try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

140
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,729
build it that way that it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

141
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,809
extend it and to understand what<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

142
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:45,180
we did and why we did it below on this

143
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:48,629
slide we see just the process we have

144
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:52,229
like the binary pcap format containing

145
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:56,270
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP messages get it through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the BGP</font>

146
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:59,580
powder and then have it in output file

147
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,080
so filtering and performance the

148
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,449
filtering happens actually in two steps

149
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,370
first of all we filter on layer 2 and

150
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:10,110
layer 3 information like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mac and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IP</font>

151
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:11,909
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if we don't need or if</font>

152
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,669
actually the filter is defined to not

153
00:07:11,909 --> 00:07:16,620
look into or to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for certain IP</font>

154
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:19,529
addresses I can discard all the others

155
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,779
and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to pass those bgp</font>

156
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,710
messages which saves a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and</font>

157
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:27,149
increases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the performance of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our tools</font>

158
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,770
there are some advanced filtering

159
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:31,439
features so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can really basically</font>

160
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,558
float on each views of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

161
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,050
next top IP address or some communities

162
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:40,919
you just want to see update messages or

163
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:43,469
whatsoever and you can combine actually

164
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,839
each of those fields in any desired

165
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:49,310
manner so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there you can combine it with</font>

166
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:51,990
a logical<font color="#CCCCCC"> end with a logical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or this</font>

167
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,120
logical not like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> negative so the Rings</font>

168
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,749
don't look for this IP address for

169
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,569
instance so it's really quite flexible

170
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:03,270
and the names of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fuse are really</font>

171
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:05,669
quickly really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we also did an</font>

172
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:08,549
evaluation correctness and performance

173
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:10,438
like the performance evaluation with

174
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,860
different settings which is shown<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

175
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:17,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">this plot we did from a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hundred</font>

176
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:21,659
thousand to up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to 1 million packets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

177
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:25,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the or messages in the pcap file and we</font>

178
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:28,740
see that is a linear crows of run time

179
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,990
we see if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an IP filter the red</font>

180
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,909
line then the performance is much better

181
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:36,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">because a lot of packets are discarded</font>

182
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:39,000
and we just look at the subset and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

183
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:42,049
have like the default running like

184
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,899
without other parameters is probably

185
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:48,120
basically just passing the stuff and

186
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:50,950
writing it in a file in a more sorted

187
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:53,050
way so then we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

188
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:56,920
the blue line and it's just slightly

189
00:08:53,050 --> 00:09:03,010
slower if we use extensive filters on

190
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:06,430
this on<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp level so what we also did to</font>

191
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,710
evaluate the correctness is we had it

192
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:12,010
run with several hours of<font color="#E5E5E5"> route server</font>

193
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:13,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">atoms from from d cakes and so that we</font>

194
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:15,160
could assure that it doesn't crash or

195
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,469
that it can really handle all the

196
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,260
information so that worked out fine and

197
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,140
what we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> did we compared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the output</font>

198
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:25,360
so we had to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do 11 Morty shark job to</font>

199
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,270
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> compare our tool to the output of</font>

200
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">P shark and really that we didn't miss</font>

201
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:36,850
some pekus some some bgp messages or

202
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:40,680
some fields of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PGP messages so a</font>

203
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:43,840
very quick demonstration so the task was

204
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,599
actually very easy we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know</font>

205
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:50,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">the distributional distribution of PGP</font>

206
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,240
whole timers at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ifp and the output</font>

207
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,030
would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a list of integer value</font>

208
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,630
separated by line breaks just to see hey

209
00:09:55,030 --> 00:10:01,390
what's actually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp whole timer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> epi</font>

210
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:03,580
cakes so and therefore we processes a

211
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,520
couple of days the commander's is there

212
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:08,620
which is fairly easy just the fuse halts

213
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,560
heimer and then we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

214
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:14,110
into a file so here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> plot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

215
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,689
comes out of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's with our tools</font>

216
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">really a simple tasks i know i can just</font>

217
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:23,050
take the data throw it into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plaza</font>

218
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,670
add a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few filtering rules or like things</font>

219
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look for in this case their</font>

220
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:30,939
whole timers and then it writes the into

221
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:33,910
a file i just use<font color="#CCCCCC"> some meth meth slot</font>

222
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,760
lip or some art code which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> super easy</font>

223
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:41,880
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can plot here the typical whole</font>

224
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:46,689
timers of customers with E kicks so um

225
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:49,450
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm happy that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you all could learn</font>

226
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,180
what we did with ppppp and I hope that

227
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and go to to the</font>

228
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:59,319
website go to pitt go to github or use

229
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:01,540
tip to just install it and play around

230
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it we're happy to take any feedback</font>

231
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:07,069
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to take</font>

232
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:07,069
any contribution thank you
