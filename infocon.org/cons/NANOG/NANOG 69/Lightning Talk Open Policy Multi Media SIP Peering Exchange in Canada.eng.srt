present to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Vince</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mammoliti one</font>

3
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:22,430
of the projects i'm currently working on

00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:27,080
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> sarah is in simple terms of is</font>

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:36,410
building an actual sip voice exchange in

00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:38,210
canada so<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently if you do nor</font>

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,339
investigation we're talking a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> sip</font>

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,890
providers in canada and we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

9
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:48,170
majority of interconnecting the legacy

10
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:50,839
PSTN networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've in what I'm reaching</font>

11
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,429
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the community itself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if anyone</font>

12
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:55,899
would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their expertise with</font>

13
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:58,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">us on failures that have worked at a</font>

14
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:02,139
success and failure that's worked across

15
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,539
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world we would like to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

16
00:01:02,139 --> 00:01:07,909
we've seen in front of a pretty simple

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:15,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">proposed architecture where we layer on</font>

18
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:19,600
top of the PSTN and creative services so

19
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:22,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">a simple architecture for us is again is</font>

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,610
leveraging the current exchanges that

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,360
are across<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada and create an open</font>

22
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:32,960
policy so if they'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to actually use</font>

23
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,840
the policy server that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have in place</font>

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:41,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">so it would be a set proxy and an enum</font>

25
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,250
service or they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could peer directly one</font>

26
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,859
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've been asked along the</font>

27
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:49,100
way as well as in creating an enum

28
00:01:45,859 --> 00:01:51,048
server and service is putting in

29
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,939
different type of credentials different

30
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:55,820
type of credentials is are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you the</font>

31
00:01:52,939 --> 00:02:00,048
actual original person that owns the

32
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:04,460
actual number also<font color="#CCCCCC"> too we want to</font>

33
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,950
leverage is a further type of analysis

34
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:09,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the data to actually block any type</font>

35
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,399
of spam

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,720
so again thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your time if</font>

37
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:20,220
anyone like to reach out to me or since

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,700
we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few more minutes if there's</font>

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,910
any questions here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not thank you</font>
