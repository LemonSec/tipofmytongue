1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:14,750
all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,040
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time extra and</font>

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,250
comparison all top you have heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,730
this will be a walk in the park in the

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,960
sense the term network efficiencies what

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:29,849
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here leaves and</font>

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,149
breathe every day even consciously<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

8
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:35,610
unconsciously right so what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

9
00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:38,040
trying to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is say you heard the term</font>

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:40,350
many many times<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people talking about</font>

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:44,010
this company<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly talking about this</font>

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:47,790
but what actually they did to improve

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,129
our even measure this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">quantities what I'm trying to do here I</font>

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,390
think you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with me</font>

16
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,960
together for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your architecture hat on</font>

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,030
for your mathematician hat on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your</font>

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">benjamin has done you think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,570
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can or we should you to our</font>

20
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">company or your network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it seeing</font>

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the importance of politics right so he</font>

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,589
thinks we need to define anything we

23
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,240
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about clearly number two we</font>

24
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:22,830
need to quantify without these two

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:24,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we're just talking flocks so</font>

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,920
that's so what a very important is that

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,690
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be numerical so now i</font>

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,440
deficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the network</font>

29
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,000
network is a bunch of equipment and put

30
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">in yoga you're perfectly different</font>

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,350
location by sprite a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people and</font>

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:45,060
hook it up and run by another bunch of

33
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:48,298
people and based on the rules set set up

34
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,460
by another bunch of people and for the

35
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:56,280
purpose of moving digital information

36
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:58,740
around and then to do what to feel some

37
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,659
companies since go like a phone service

38
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,179
provider wealth of thousands and

39
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,860
transmissions and make a bundle that's

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,900
whole thing right so when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

41
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,560
networks ition see we need to keep all

42
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,299
these different components in mind

43
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,060
please see what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a half so if you are</font>

44
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,170
moving fits around we need thinking

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,599
about that

46
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,839
and how efficiently you can use that

47
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,290
hard work and has offered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the job</font>

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,060
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know how people manage to</font>

49
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,150
do things and how they were actually

50
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,400
performers and also what exactly this

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,360
network doing to fulfill your business

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,580
go as the as what a unit in general you

53
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do so all these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things need to</font>

54
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,340
work together in one way<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the other</font>

55
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:46,440
actually two to make sense and you can

56
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,660
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you from your own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> company come and</font>

57
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:50,310
they expect one thing in service Oh

58
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,319
Maron the other thing sometimes we do

59
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,390
all can be jumping around and trying to

60
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what exactly is going on with</font>

61
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,730
our network so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

62
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:02,310
efficiency and with only three different

63
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,260
components and maybe one of the simplest

64
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:07,230
way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> define it would be this</font>

65
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,149
simple formula basically you have some

66
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,560
terms which is the capacity and the

67
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,600
operations they are expecting your

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,610
bottom line and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have a service</font>

69
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,819
efficiency which you affect your coupler

70
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:19,830
and the very point we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

71
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it they see these things could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

72
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:26,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">encountered each other if you don't do</font>

73
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:30,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">it do it correctly and then you are not</font>

74
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,400
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make a good business decisions</font>

75
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:37,048
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important thing is about the</font>

76
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,000
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> for efficiency right so the lot</font>

77
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:41,370
of things whereas we are as engineers

78
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,519
we're geeks to do all things technically

79
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,140
advanced or<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on out ourselves</font>

80
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,269
however we cannot use that to impede

81
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,040
your business goals and management to

82
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,350
make decisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> based on all kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

83
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,358
decisions but are they these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

84
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,850
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually advance your businesses</font>

85
00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:00,200
or the other way around so it's very

86
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:03,470
important this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just engineering</font>

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:07,500
criteria also if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see clear</font>

88
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:09,239
standards so let's go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back talk about</font>

89
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,760
service right it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important thing</font>

90
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,340
this is how the hope the existence the

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,589
purpose of the company<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists to do this</font>

92
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing so what is the service efficiency</font>

93
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,918
in this particular case so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

94
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:22,979
first component which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the</font>

95
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,859
agreeing or service or product to the

96
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,349
market to your to your network and

97
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,060
second term would be how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually</font>

98
00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:32,030
prove

99
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,940
pure customer on to this network and the

100
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,929
third term would be how you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are spending</font>

101
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:41,000
money to make this thing happen right so

102
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:44,090
you see that is the we use a timeline

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,100
there to define these efficiencies the

104
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,710
last one you for the easier using a

105
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,240
capital<font color="#CCCCCC"> s to represent the dollars right</font>

106
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,700
I don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the dollar sign in</font>

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,400
there looks to bleeding<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you see</font>

108
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:59,180
anywhere you see a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> s you represent</font>

109
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,650
a dollar sign right is a number so where

110
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,979
are important things here you see the

111
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:05,870
the the the any decisions especially we

112
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:08,840
see in my company in many other

113
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,600
countries and when you do not keep when

114
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,429
the management cannot identify what is

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,100
becoming what is the most important

116
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,870
business currently in the market how do

117
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make money</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of it and if you</font>

118
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:24,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">spend years time to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this develops and</font>

119
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,810
going back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth you're losing what</font>

120
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:28,909
you're costing you a huge amount of

121
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,760
opportunity cost this is a one term that

122
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,320
in many places is completely ignored

123
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,349
people don't understand it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

124
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think about it or between the cars</font>

125
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,620
actually from but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i standing my</font>

126
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:47,810
companies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's a major</font>

127
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:50,870
major problem that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> not making</font>

128
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:55,550
decisions based on the actual business

129
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,530
two goals about using some other process

130
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:00,260
and procedures you see that indecision

131
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,929
lack of a vision and and very slow

132
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,080
reaction right so here in this day and

133
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,270
age<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think the audience as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vs and all</font>

134
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,740
these nutrients is trying to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

135
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,960
this service part is his meeting

136
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,380
automatic email from operation

137
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,960
perspective that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very simple</font>

138
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:25,219
defining here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically how much the</font>

139
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,469
cost and and to operate<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network</font>

140
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:32,380
compared with your total capacity and

141
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:35,270
also do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually have any</font>

142
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:38,440
operationally involved arrows which

143
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:41,620
causing you a problem

144
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,100
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> original cost defined above is</font>

145
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:48,700
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with those people and</font>

146
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:50,110
to write and many places<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we are</font>

that that carefully especially the

167
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,789
define how you run your fancy exactly or

with this new thing which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> great which</font>

292
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:31,499
is revolutionary if choose the fixed

when you go to higher seat 16 kilobytes

295
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:44,229
per frame think about this compared with

296
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:47,889
our normal transmission transportation

<font color="#CCCCCC">it on a stick science you can do</font>

302

whatever you want with it otn same thing

303
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:17,470
the only problem is a big problem this

304
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:21,339
one they invented<font color="#CCCCCC"> otn it's a bunch of</font>

314
00:15:48,129 --> 00:15:52,540
ocean we have a bunch of containership

see your son is a fixed rate using a

325
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:22,660
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be crazy so how come we as</font>

326
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:24,189
a customer using this network and they

327
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,618
are putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a container ships all</font>

over the place and sixty percent done or

329
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:32,110
more I empty and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't do anything</font>

330
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:37,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">why did you don't care that's the</font>

331
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:39,180
problem can we fix it that's whether

332
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:41,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's is there</font>

333
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:44,800
there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very thing about this right</font>

334
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,720
here is synchronized network every

335
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,719
single frame is going out on the line

336
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,060
every single second it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like I d</font>

337
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,530
sometimes you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets sometimes you</font>

338
00:16:52,060 --> 00:17:00,510
don't do you think we can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to</font>

339
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:05,319
actually make that container IP aware

340
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:09,339
fill it up fill us easy put buffer there

341
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:13,929
fill it up a hundred get the free sec

342
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:15,669
microseconds per frame then you send it

343
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">off you put some discs there say okay</font>

344
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:20,620
this guy has something in it this guy

345
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,399
does not anywhere you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass these</font>

346
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:27,520
drawers vast and empty frames and only

347
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,760
71 with stuff in it so how the whole

348
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,110
transportation network should work

349
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,650
you're all these things bitch just like

350
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:37,300
I see is an easier than<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideal for harder</font>

351
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:40,120
than happy is easier right because in

352
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,210
six rate and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how much</font>

353
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:48,909
see a different speeds together so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

354
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:52,300
do that IP and it would here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

355
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:55,660
thing save us a bunch of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if</font>

356
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:58,960
you make this into a real product make

357
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:01,810
you a bunch of money<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run right</font>

358
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:05,260
now what we have is attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> over OPN</font>

359
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:08,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus text over 74 take it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over sine</font>

360
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:16,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">color past so whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's effect over</font>

361
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:16,080
OD and calm right that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fun</font>

362
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,929
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a capacity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiency what I</font>

363
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,389
call one of the possibilities to

364
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:29,230
ultimately solve this problem but that's

365
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:31,720
a problem if you can do this one you

366
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:41,560
know I tea and really pack optical

367
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:44,590
network you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be great and so far you</font>

368
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:50,530
have seen my slides right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I made a</font>

369
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:55,169
cardinal things here there's zero

370
00:18:50,530 --> 00:19:03,129
pictures sorry people say a picture

371
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:10,210
worth a thousand words what I showed

372
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:15,480
here are a bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> foreigners I will</font>

373
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:15,480
say a formula worth a thousand pictures

374
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:22,180
because that if you clearly define what

375
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:25,330
I want if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> clearly define what is</font>

376
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:29,230
wrong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure if you love actual</font>

377
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,990
vision how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures with</font>

378
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:35,650
anticipation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> produce that's which</font>

379
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:38,140
are the truth coming out all the people

380
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:40,090
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to increase</font>

381
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:42,100
their network stations there includes

382
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,020
the organization efficiency or whatever

383
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:45,850
right the executive is doing all kind of

384
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,129
rewards so every time they come in<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

385
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:52,209
done probably the real auction they real

386
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:54,430
all got around does that do anything if

387
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:57,510
you actually put our actions all

388
00:19:54,430 --> 00:20:00,730
companies and departments and personal

389
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:04,960
actions into<font color="#E5E5E5"> formulas and measure the</font>

390
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:06,790
mouth and you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> base</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it's</font>

391
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,950
not you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> competing with anybody</font>

392
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,440
else you can use these formulas actually

393
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:13,660
measure your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> programs and then what</font>

394
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,790
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do from capacity perspectives</font>

395
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,370
operational<font color="#CCCCCC"> protectors from service</font>

396
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:21,399
perspective to measures as the function

397
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:23,229
of time that's real program that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

398
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,670
the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing's people talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

399
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,490
because now we are not swinging jazz

400
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:28,250
hand with we actually have a numerical

401
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:31,430
number two

402
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:33,260
talk of Courtney just numbers are not

403
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,570
the whole thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to back</font>

404
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,820
up<font color="#CCCCCC"> as many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other best practices and</font>

405
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:44,330
everything else however this is very

406
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:47,120
important right and also networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

407
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:50,860
living in a very trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do run by a</font>

408
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:57,439
bunch of folks folks by humans humans

409
00:20:50,860 --> 00:21:00,740
can be stupidities right we see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

410
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:06,100
our own environment and we can see human

411
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:09,410
ingenuity to the ingenuity comes from

412
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:13,040
you look for yourself look at your own

413
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:18,680
organization of your own<font color="#CCCCCC"> company in</font>

414
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:20,570
truth a veritable<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers and then you</font>

415
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:24,230
see the truth then you figure out what

416
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:26,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do and going forward so I'm</font>

417
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:29,990
presenting here is not just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bunch of</font>

418
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:36,800
formulas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> but they could be used to</font>

419
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:39,110
actually advance a business and so this

420
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,990
conference is everybody is expert here

421
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:44,060
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't need too much and all these</font>

422
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:47,660
efficiency we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about the service of</font>

423
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:49,550
the capacity in operations what what

424
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,970
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> could actually can improve that</font>

425
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:54,950
is a control plan<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now lesbian</font>

426
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,260
everybody's automation we heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

427
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,360
the the all things we want to do is

428
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:06,890
actually using<font color="#CCCCCC"> the control plan to</font>

429
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:08,870
improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> your an hour and control plan</font>

430
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:11,660
can be defined in<font color="#E5E5E5"> many many ways right</font>

431
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:14,300
and people using the wherever you want

432
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:16,280

433
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:20,000
but important<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you need to</font>

434
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,590
understand that the the control plan

435
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,410
what you want to do is trying to use

436
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,720
software to do a global<font color="#E5E5E5"> occupation and</font>

437
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:29,770
global control and global organization

438
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:34,850
and the problem with values you do not

439
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:37,490
have a clear and defined and a control

440
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,459
plant and the mexican club can't control

441
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:45,720
plan equals the very card

442
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:49,390
for your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course you can</font>

443
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:52,890
have many many ways to do I mean where I

444
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:55,059
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say too much here and the</font>

445
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:57,940
more intelligence they're putting in

network its most likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're to</font>

447
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:04,149
achieving a higher network efficiency so

448
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:20,770
that's what in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next few years you</font>

449
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:24,158
probably can see thank you question time

for questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matty connect Yahoo I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

451
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,549
your concept of poo very creative one

452
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,370
question I had about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your poo which is</font>

453
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:35,590
you talked about marking the 6 16

454
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,120
kilobyte frames with traffic engineering

455
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:42,309
information that would tell it where to

456

go this traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering hand wave is</font>

457
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:48,129
that going to be IP addresses is it

458
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:49,809
going to be magical<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls tags any</font>

459
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,020
thought on how you would actually mark

460
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:55,178
these constant rate 16 kilobyte frames

461
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:59,590
as to where they ultimately want to go

462
00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:02,980
in a network now you're asking the zoo

463
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:08,620
these ingredients of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular all</font>

464
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so please let's think about right</font>

465
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,750
now without any of these categories

466
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:18,090
where do they go it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what</font>

467
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:23,200
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked them to go the obstacle layers</font>

468
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:24,879
you have this color lunatic right this

469
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,669
color industry thing come from is

470

471
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:32,980
light of a voiceless that's where we go

472
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,720
they don't go anywhere else in the

473
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:38,049
middle you have all the rodents in the

474
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:41,440
middle because optically express so

475
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:43,779
there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're optically browser so</font>

504
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,550
you're basically looking at doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lamba</font>

tags on the entry carry the lender tag

00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,169
across to the far side and then peel

00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:30,030
back out updates on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay get near the</font>

508
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:32,640
clerk a hand in many places and you need

509
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:34,590
to regenerate right some network a short

510
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,210
meeting we generally go to 15 or more

511
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:38,250
than 300 kilometers so you'll have to

512
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:40,110
regenerate right what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we generally</font>

513

is that you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the OPA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rotom</font>

also add an intersection of your fiber

can you do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> reliably enough for you</font>

536

end up with congestion it's interesting

537
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:46,750
a concept I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:58,870
but I see you can see hazel what's to do

542
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:59,860
it's an interesting mental exercise but

543
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,629
I'm not sure you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

hardware vendors rushing out to do it

545
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">tomorrow thank you for the thought</font>
