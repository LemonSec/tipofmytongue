00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,730
our next lightning talk is job<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schneider</font>

00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:13,730
presenting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shutdown communication</font>

00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:20,759
thank you my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Snyder's I work</font>

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:23,399
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntt communications and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here</font>

5
00:00:20,759 --> 00:00:25,529
today to share with you some work we've

6
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:30,480
been doing over the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months to</font>

7
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,850
make your operational lives easier and

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,160
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will specifically focus on the aspect</font>

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:40,530
of communication between ebgp neighbors

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:43,620
all of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ebgp sessions and these</font>

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,230
sessions can be considered the wire

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,839
between two tin cans and although it is

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,540
beautiful that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pronounce route</font>

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,510
announcements from<font color="#E5E5E5"> our site to your site</font>

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,530
or vice versa there are a few tiny

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:01,559
things that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lacking for instance if</font>

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not entirely sure who is on the</font>

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the wire and that could</font>

19
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:07,530
easily happen at public internet

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,450
exchanges or because parts of your

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,970
administration were lost ten years ago

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,390
when you migrated from this database to

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,690
that database so we're left<font color="#E5E5E5"> with very</font>

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,170
few actual communication mechanisms

25
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,450
between ebgp neighbors one thing you

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:29,940
could do is you could flap the session

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:36,240
or use optical signals like their peer

28
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:38,600
are you there what's up Mike oh I'm job

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh</font>

30
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:47,259
what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the game last</font>

31
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,240
Sunday and then if the other guy falls

32
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:51,640
silent then either he<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't like the</font>

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">game or there some issue between the two</font>

34
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">of you technical issue and this</font>

35
00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:00,280
especially becomes apparent with

36
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:02,920
maintenance we announced to our

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,560
customers dear customer two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,720
now will reboot this device there will

39
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,119
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30 minutes of downtime this is the</font>

40
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:13,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">tracking ID this is where you can call</font>

41
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:14,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">in to the knock and etc and then two</font>

42
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,589
weeks later when the session actually

43
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:21,310
goes down customers will email the knock

44
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:24,100
and be like why is the session down dude

45
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:25,660
and then you show them the notification

46
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,790
you set them two<font color="#E5E5E5"> weeks prior</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

47
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,549
like oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I forgot to add that to my</font>

48
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:32,350
calendar and vice versa this happens as

49
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:35,470
well we get maintenance notifications

50
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:37,239
from other peers and we are not always

51
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:41,920
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> disciplined as we should be in that</font>

52
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:46,750
regard so<font color="#CCCCCC"> to enhance this specific</font>

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:50,519
aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP operations I and two of my</font>

54
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:53,860
friends we we dove into the ITF murdered

55
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:56,470
to extend the beach p protocol in such a

56
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,650
way that when you shut down a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

57
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:02,890
session you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop a tiny message in</font>

58
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:08,620
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pierce syslog or whatever mechanism</font>

59
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:10,839
he uses and the way this<font color="#E5E5E5"> works is in the</font>

60
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,060
BGP protocol you have a cease

61
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,700
notification and this is the message

62
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sent to the neighbor when the</font>

63
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:22,060
session<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about to go down and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the Seas</font>

64
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,290
notification has a crude extensibility

65
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:30,459
in that you can just append data to that

66
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,380
message and in some versions of the Seas

67
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:36,190
notification this is used to for

68
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:39,609
instance indicate some information about

69
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,650
y<font color="#E5E5E5"> MX prefix limit was tripped or or what</font>

70
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,100
caused the problem and what we've done

71
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,190
here is we've extended the shutdown

72
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:52,170
event and the reset event that you can

73
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:54,160
have up to 128 bytes worth of

74
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:58,049
communication message

75
00:03:54,160 --> 00:04:00,579
in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular beach p message and</font>

76
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:04,030
this is really neat because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it builds</font>

77
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:07,600
upon an existing<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP message type so</font>

78
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:10,090
from a protocol design perspective it's

79
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,340
kind of it's a small change<font color="#CCCCCC"> its we're</font>

80
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">not we're not changing bgp in a</font>

81
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,390
significant way it is backwards

82
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,690
compatible in the sense that existing

83
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,579
speakers will not act weird when<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

84
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:26,920
receive this data because the session

85
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:29,620
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going down anyway so that's that's</font>

86
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,380
all quite nice and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this looks like</font>

87
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:35,350
I'm for instance openbsd who already

88
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,290
support this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just type on the</font>

89
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,720
command line this neighbor needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

90
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,390
disabled and I can append that short

91
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,060
message for instance this is the ticket

92
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,849
ID we're upgrading and we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font>

93
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">30 minutes and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that would look like</font>

94
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:54,430
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> receiving side is you have the</font>

95
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,790
syslog message that says hey the session

96
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:00,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">is now down and next to that is a</font>

97
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,170
message<font color="#CCCCCC"> that contains my shutdown</font>

98
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:06,580
communication which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent to that</font>

99
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:10,210
specific pier and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

100
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:15,430
greatly enhance our operations in the

101
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:20,020
peering world this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is maybe what it</font>

102
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:23,380
could look like on juniper or on cisco

103
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,919
iOS XR when you clear session maybe this

104
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:31,180
is what it will look like so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

105
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:33,219
at implementation the ITF still has that

106
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,350
attitude that put your code where your

107
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:38,230
mouth is and then you can progress rings

108
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:42,220
through the ITF much easier then if you

109
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:47,500
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing to show for so openbsd has</font>

110
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:50,770
this implemented go bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> PMX the traffic</font>

111
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">analyze engine X a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP as it and there</font>

112
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,469
are decoders for Wireshark and TCP dump

113
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:59,229
available for protocol designers to

114
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:02,260
debug this particular extension to the

115
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:05,380
BGP protocol and I've heard positive

116
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,409
feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> from birth a famous route</font>

117
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,080
surfer application

118
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:12,360
cisco iOS XR has showed some interest

119
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,808
the Juniper people have showed some

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:18,479
interest and from Nokia as well I've

121
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:22,229
heard positive feedback so this doesn't

122
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:25,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean they will actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build it this</font>

123
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:27,989
means you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email your account</font>

124
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:31,679
managers point them to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

125
00:06:27,989 --> 00:06:33,659
and say their account manager could you

126
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:37,649
please implement this feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

127
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:40,739
looks useful to me and the people inside

128
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:42,539
these organizations these vendors if

129
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:45,628
they receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> from multiple customers</font>

130
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:48,628
feedback that this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful it</font>

131
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:51,779
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be prioritized and maybe later this</font>

132
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:54,419
year will receive these features or and

133
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:57,379
if not none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email into the</font>

134
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:01,169
account managers then perhaps it's 2018

135
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:03,659
2019 or maybe it will never happen so it

136
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:08,669
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on you guys email your</font>

137
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:12,240
account managers and of course because

138
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:15,869
it's 2017<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a whole world</font>

139
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:20,189
outside North America that does not use

140
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:25,019
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clean 7-bit ascii stuff it will</font>

141
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:26,729
support utf-8<font color="#E5E5E5"> and does Unicode that</font>

142
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:30,029
doesn't mean that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your router will</font>

143
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:32,039
actually display these emojis but for

144
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:35,849
instance X a BGP actually shows the

145
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,769
emojis so that's kind of cool but you

146
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:39,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">know of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll only use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this tool</font>

147
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:42,539
in a very professional<font color="#CCCCCC"> and serious</font>

148
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:47,179
manner and then you know use ticket<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDs</font>

149
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:47,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">and operationally relevant information</font>

150
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:57,809
so the shutdown communication it is 128

151
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:59,699
bytes max<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prevent visual</font>

152
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:02,819
spoofing because it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be kind of</font>

153
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,009
annoying if half your syslog<font color="#CCCCCC"> turned out</font>

154
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:07,529
to be this one shut down communication

155
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,869
message from a malicious actor by

156
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,379
keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> the message short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe will</font>

157
00:08:09,869 --> 00:08:18,479
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more easier to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grukk for our</font>

158
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:20,990
operations that's it are there any

159
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions</font>

160
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:34,839
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago two thousand nine or</font>

161
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,779
so who are you oh my Lenny Giuliano

162
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:42,390
juniper there was a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

163
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:45,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar to this bgp administrative</font>

164
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:49,600
information something like that where

165
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:54,040
you could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> send text any text do you</font>

166
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,820
perhaps mean the advisory yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

167
00:08:54,040 --> 00:09:00,519
it and its successor the operational

168
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:04,420
message draft yeah you know I didn't see

169
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:07,360
that but is this a similar idea just<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

170
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">shut down time or whatever happened to</font>

171
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,149
that there certainly are similarities

172
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:16,360
between the two efforts however<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

173
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:18,760
has more implementations so that's

174
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,700
useful and it doesn't define a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

175
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,250
message type and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

176
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,290
introducing a new BGP message type in

177
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:30,940
the eye dr<font color="#E5E5E5"> worker group IDR is</font>

178
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:33,370
responsible for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP protocol it it's</font>

179
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:35,730
kind of hard to sell such a big

180
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,250
modification to the protocol and this

181
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:43,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">beach</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> p shut</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down communication it just</font>

182
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:46,540
redefines existing positions in the the

183
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,490
protocol so to speak so<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a protocol</font>

184
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:52,529
design perspective this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a tiny</font>

185
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:55,959
change whereas the other efforts were

186
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:59,350
very big chunks of work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> filter get</font>

187
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:02,109
consensus and momentum but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a way they</font>

188
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,990
are similar this extension only works at

189
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:06,910
shut down time or reset which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i figure</font>

190
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,470
would be the starting point because

191
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:14,709
that's where you need that additional

192
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:17,140
information most clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> chris will</font>

193
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,180
field sales force I came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him was</font>

194
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,240
exactly the same question<font color="#CCCCCC"> what which was</font>

195
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:25,449
this is obviously tied to a shutdown is

196
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,380
there any perceived usefulness to having

197
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:31,889
a free-form message type that is outside

198
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:35,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a BGP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shutdown event</font>

199
00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:38,759
it is certainly worth discussing I've

200
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,800
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in touch with the offers of the</font>

201
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">advisory draft that will start at almost</font>

202
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:47,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago the intent is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

203
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:49,479
first finish this work and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font>

204
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,569
if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't address all our</font>

205
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,810
operational needs then we'll attempt to

206
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:58,750
formulate a<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to send a message while</font>

207
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,810
the session is up and not down but we've

208
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:04,089
split<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two efforts in that regard as</font>

209
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,829
say risk distribution yeah this

210
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:08,430
definitely appears to be lower hanging

211
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:13,829
fruit and excellent progress thank you

212
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright my time is up goodbye</font>
