00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,520
and it is a joint<font color="#CCCCCC"> walk with of a high</font>

focused<font color="#CCCCCC"> on our pikia its deployment and</font>

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,840
security properties so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me start with</font>

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,169
clear and brief reminder of what are

00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,479
wikia is so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> resource public key</font>

9
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,670
infrastructure or the RPK I'm marks

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,730
networking objects and specifically I'm

11
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:40,969
going to focus on IQ cliff excels to the

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:43,309
organizations that on them and avocado

13
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:45,140
is really intended to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things so</font>

14
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:48,530
the first one is to prevent critics and

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">subway fix hijacks and the second one is</font>

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lay sort of later cryptographic</font>

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,940

18
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,789

on<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter domain routing routing and</font>

20
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,659
specifically it lays the cryptographic

21
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:07,580
foundation and the keying mechanisms

22
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:10,990
behind bgp set so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just quickly</font>

23
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:15,789
remind what prefix and suffix isaacs are

24
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:20,600
so assume we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have 11 legitimate origin</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">44.6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS service</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plate 20 and that a yes</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sy so now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asy lambs allowed to that to</font>

28
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,600
the I galaxies within that basics and

29
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:38,649
send the traffic there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also falls</font>

30
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,020
that advertisement on to ASX of course

31
00:01:38,649 --> 00:01:46,600
appending its own<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifier to go out</font>

32
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:50,840
so now sx learn some out to destroy fix

33
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:54,199
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker is a 666</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> announces the</font>

34
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:57,530

37
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:08,389

38
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:12,140
traffic flows to to a 666 instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

moved a spy to date to the other side of

43

here does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not matter and topic would</font>

53
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:58,269
flow to the attacker so how does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPI</font>

54
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,090
prevent that well<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pki certifies</font>

55
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:05,230
ownership over IP prefixes so to do that

56
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:08,879
it assigns an IV perfect to a public key

57
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:12,518
for release or certificate or an LC and

58
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,668
and let for now let's assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

59
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,040
South Seas can be false and they are

61
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:23,319
authorized to do so I'm going to

62
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:27,790
slightly talk about about the chain of

63
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:30,399
classf in lbk later on and then the

64
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:32,709
owner who owns the private key that

65
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,949
corresponds to the public key specified

66

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> DLC can now sign allowed oh gee mr.</font>

68
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:45,040
published and its public domain so

69
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,370
everyone can know about it and the light

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,858
and the five identifies the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SS who are</font>

71
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:55,290
authorized to advertise that specifics

00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:58,959
in btp so<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back to my example</font>

73
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:02,888
perfect 90 10 / 10 actually belongs to

74
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:04,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">georgia telecom and and they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were they</font>

75
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,370
took the measures in order to protect

78
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,040
domain and they also use the users I'll

79
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,699
see to issue a while so now those are

80
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,589
that everyone should know about

81
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,560
protecting perfect 91 dot B of the

00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:57,560
and now a sexy knows about this about

94
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,450
this sauce so it knows that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font>

announcement is actually invalid and so

100
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,350
it can be scouted and traffic will flow

start about talking insecure about

110

other security mechanism it allows the

might deploy it in an insecure manner

113
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:57,289
and specifically i'm going to talk about

114
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,929
what we call loose soils so consider

115
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:03,320
this similar to policy now where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

116
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:05,419
the legitimate<font color="#CCCCCC"> owner a.s.a and that</font>

117
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,090
owner had advertised the war for its own

118
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:11,030

119
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:13,388
Sixteen and you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the oils</font>

120
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,849
maximum length allows precisely that

121
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:21,350
that idea that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Occupy seeks to be to</font>

123
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:28,160

124
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,000
circumvent the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpi defense and doing</font>

125
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,180
that by by announcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,180
so as I announcer that and our second

127
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,770
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider convent the app you can</font>

128
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,870
type to circumvent the applique defense

129
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:47,020
by sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> announcing announcing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a false</font>

130
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:50,200
path to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> say-so in this case the</font>

131
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,060
attacker sort of makes up a link to a SI

132
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,940
and and now this advertisement looks

133
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,400
valid according to the RBI because air

134
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,400
is the actual origin the specified in

135
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,960
the advertisement and and that's the

136
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,989
whole thing that's allowed by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RTI</font>

137
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:10,570
the maximum length is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> is valid and</font>

138
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,880
so a sec receives that<font color="#E5E5E5"> receive that</font>

139
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:15,430
advertisement to<font color="#E5E5E5"> and which way would it</font>

140
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,790
go well it's likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with the</font>

141
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:24,310
shorter path so still topic is likely to

142
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:25,960
flow in the correct direction and there

143
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,270
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been actually extensive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> studies</font>

144
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,219
about that and the this attack is

145
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:34,120
actually called the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hop attack in</font>

146
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:35,800
the in the paper that I'm citing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and</font>

147
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,380
then it was shown to be much less

148
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,440
effective than the negative prefix

149
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">isaacs so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consider that as</font>

150
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,610
sort of a windfall for the upper case so

151
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:49,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is a good thing that applique I can</font>

152
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,250
achieve but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now consider the case where</font>

153
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:54,760
the maximum length is actually pretty

154
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:57,520
permissive so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they say instead of saying</font>

155
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,810
instead of fighting 16 as the maximum

156
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,909
length actually specifies 24 so now the

157
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">law</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really loose the though our</font>

158
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:10,140
allows for advertising<font color="#E5E5E5"> / fixes that are</font>

159
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:14,140
not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually advertised by a SI</font>

160
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:17,020
and well our attacker can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage</font>

161
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,900
of that so it would carry the exact same

162
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:24,729
attack except instead of the / 16 inch

163
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,440
would say / 24 and that means according

164
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,440
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the longest prefix match all the</font>

165
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:34,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic will actually flow to the</font>

166
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:36,570
attacker 666 so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just say that</font>

167
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:40,838
this attack is also mentioned in our c7

168
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:42,960
115 and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the examples and there is</font>

169
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:45,240
mentioned as sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of film and</font>

170
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,920
that's less likely to be noticed but I

171
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,600
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

172
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,360
attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually more likely to</font>

173
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:56,430
succeed especially because they attack

174
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:59,460
is supper at six so just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wake up why</font>

175
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:02,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">does this attack walk so we have the</font>

176
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:05,190
attacker 666 and it claims to be a

177
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,230
neighbor of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SI but the rpi does not</font>

178
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:10,890
provide any mechanism that allows to

179
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,740
make sure that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> valid SI does not</font>

180
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:16,319
actually originate that the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

181
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:19,680
the attackers targets especially fall so

182
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,350
though I is loose and but the always

183
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,729
looks and allows that and finally the

184
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,410
longest prefix match all and shows that

185
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,150
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost a issues the attackers the</font>

186
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:34,230
hydrogen is actually going to get a

187
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:39,300
topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is regardless of where it</font>

188
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:42,390
is located in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network so how common</font>

189
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,079
are these insecure deployments well it

190
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:47,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">turns out they are pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common so</font>

191
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,070
around thirty percent of the prefixes

192
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:55,110
that I'll covered by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Al pki are actually</font>

193
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:57,240
sort of unprotected because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

194
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,280
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty-nine percent of the</font>

195
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,050
prefixes with maximum length<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

196
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,449
louder than a terrific strength so

197
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">predictions that are taking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font>

198
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,430
this maximum length property are

199
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:11,550
actually vulnerable so almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

200
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,589
who's taken advantage of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally</font>

201
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,540
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to also point out that it</font>

202
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:17,450
actually manifest some loud for<font color="#E5E5E5"> vitals</font>

203
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,819
so we've seen some really important

204
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:23,420
important organizations that have used a

205
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:27,380
very permissive length in their walls

206
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,530
and these vulnerabilities actually

207
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:34,040
should be solved on bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> sac is deployed</font>

208
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:37,319
but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a long time until then so</font>

209
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:39,150
until until then we actually better not

210
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,560
issue loose soils and use the minimum

211
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:45,209
maximum length that's required so the

212
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">next thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about is</font>

213
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:52,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the human error factor and and it turns</font>

214
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,120
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the rpi there are many other</font>

215
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,100
mistake

216
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,770
that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have made and specifically</font>

217
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,080
there are bad laws which<font color="#CCCCCC"> caused between</font>

218
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:04,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">calls legitimate perfect cells to appear</font>

219
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,920
as invalid if you're doing also gene

220
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:10,020
validation according to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPI and</font>

221
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,860
specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might cause for</font>

222
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,240
someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> who is doing filtering to</font>

223
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,070
disconnect from<font color="#E5E5E5"> legitimate destinations</font>

224
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,980
and there have been extensive

225
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:22,290
measurements about that so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

226
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,810
point out that out of the about six and

227
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:26,699
a half percent of the prefixes that I'll

228
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,689
cover that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are announcing VDP and are</font>

229
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:34,410
covered by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpi about just over eight</font>

230
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:36,990
percent are invalid and another almost

231
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">thirty percent of valid but actually</font>

232
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:43,830
unprotected because of these loose soils

233
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:46,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've shown you earlier so we've</font>

234
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:49,500
also done a short survey short anonymous

235
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,500
survey for network operators in this

236
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,680
world and we've asked them what what is

237
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,930
the main<font color="#CCCCCC"> concern regarding doing rpki</font>

238
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:01,949
based audio notification in your network

239
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,959
and as you can see the very important

240
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:05,850
thing that that was pointed<font color="#E5E5E5"> out is</font>

241
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually being disconnected from from</font>

242
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:12,860
destination so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a too concerned</font>

243
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:16,170
about about other carriers in practice

244
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:18,690
and so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked who who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

245
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations behind these bad laws and</font>

246
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:24,990
so here on the plot you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see on the</font>

247
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:29,520
x-axis the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for issuance and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

248
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:33,840
the y-axis the faction of l's that that

249
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:35,250
is all cause and what we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

250
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,370
actually some pretty good news because

251
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems that only a few organizations</font>

252
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:43,020
are actually have actually issued their

253
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:45,300
was causing most of the of the problems

254
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:48,150
so we actually view this is very good

255
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,359
news because some focused assault and

256
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:53,760
maybe some convincing for these guys

257
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,250
might improve the integrity of the

258
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">information in the RPI quite a bit and</font>

259
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,360
the last thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I want to talk about</font>

260
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this part of the talk</font>

261
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,970
inter-organizational dependency

262
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,339
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two inter-organizational</font>

263
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:14,220
dependencies that the topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sort of</font>

264
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:15,660
encapsulate and the first one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

265
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:20,489
download dependency which is a

266
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:23,040
dependency in issuing or so specifically

267
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:26,689
consider the following scenario there is

268
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,339
a regional there is an irr and now I are

269
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:32,519
who holds the<font color="#E5E5E5"> certificate for the domain</font>

270
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,649
they have allocated they have signed the

271
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,889
certificate and I'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> for some</font>

272
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:42,379
provider with the / 8 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then that</font>

273
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:46,230
provider and in the in the decades that

274
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:48,989
it has this this IP prefix it's all

275
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">parts of it to some customers now as</font>

276
00:13:48,989 --> 00:13:55,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">soon as that that provider issues goes</font>

277
00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:57,569
on an issue 04 its own IP prefix it

278
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,758
would make customer announcements that

279
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:04,199
are not covered by<font color="#E5E5E5"> oils to actually</font>

280
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,730
appear in value so so and the reason is

281
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:07,709
that these customers will now be

282
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,179
perceived as sort of subway<font color="#CCCCCC"> flicks</font>

283
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:10,799
hijackers although they are the

284
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:15,949
legitimate owners of the architrave

285
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:19,019
fixes so we've measured so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

286
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:21,359
so for how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many terrific season and what</font>

287
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,230
portion of the IP address space they

288
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually exist such dependencies and</font>

289
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:29,819
what we've seen is again some good news

290
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:32,100
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not applied for a whole lot</font>

291
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:35,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">of organizations and article pictures</font>

292
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:39,749
and as you can see here most are not

293
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:41,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually dependent some bad news that</font>

294
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:44,790
come with that is a does that action

295
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:47,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll actually dependent are really</font>

296
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:50,459
important so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here again a</font>

297
00:14:47,069 --> 00:14:53,248
CDF and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> x-axis discussed the number</font>

298
00:14:50,459 --> 00:14:58,378
of organizations the y-axis describes

299
00:14:53,249 --> 00:15:00,779
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fraction of of them of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

300
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:02,879
dependencies either for prefixes or for

301
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,649
the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address space and you can see</font>

302
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,449
that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the dependent IP</font>

303
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:09,480
address space belongs to just a few

304
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:12,769
organizations suggesting that the IP

305
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,769
address space is quite large

306
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:18,780
and and then the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of these</font>

307
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,790
dependencies is the dependency in

308
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,189
issuing a certificate so now consider

309
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,870
the following similar scenario we have

310
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:28,260
the same provider but now that provider

311
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:29,880
did not bother<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get enough see so the</font>

312
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,120
provider does not have an hour see but

313
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:35,490
and now he its customers want and join

314
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpi so they want so they need and</font>

315
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:40,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll see except the provider does not</font>

316
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,850
have and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ski to sign their</font>

317
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,040
location so this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a deployment</font>

318
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,500
practice a decline in<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in parties</font>

319
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,910
especially in case that this chain

320
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:56,550
between the aisle who holds well seen in

321
00:15:53,910 --> 00:16:00,630
this case and the customers is quite

322
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,760
long the customers might try to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

323
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:07,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I up to the aisle and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

324
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:09,000
certified<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly it might be there</font>

325
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,380
might be some challenges in partisan

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,970
doing that so this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an issue so</font>

327
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,470
we've also checked how many

328
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:19,440
organizations are actually up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

329
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">dependent and again some good news it</font>

330
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,380
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like not that much so any</font>

331
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:28,620
the allocation<font color="#CCCCCC"> player is quite shallow</font>

332
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,720
and again here the x-axis describes the

333
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:32,730
depth of the dependency and you can see

334
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,520
that for most does actually no

335
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:41,280
dependency so that's quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now</font>

336
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:43,170
I'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the some</font>

337
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,900
mechanism that a system<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've been</font>

338
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,170
to improve the information accuracy but

339
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:52,050
cause it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LP ki and so our system</font>

340
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:55,020
is called<font color="#CCCCCC"> water and it has two sides to</font>

341
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:56,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">it so one side is the web</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interface</font>

342
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,370
that's available<font color="#E5E5E5"> at well as the tog</font>

343
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:03,570
which allows network operators to check

344
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:06,150
whether the whether the IP prefixes are

345
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:10,410
properly protected by us and if not why

346
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:13,260
not so if they have a loose<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that</font>

347
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,390
would indicate that if they if the s

348
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,050
number is wrong that would indicate that

349
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:22,440
and would say what today s number<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and</font>

350
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:25,109
also if they have a too short of a

351
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,539
maximum<font color="#CCCCCC"> length</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for what for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what at my</font>

352
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:26,888
eyes

353
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:28,840
should be being announced it would it

354
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:32,379
would say that and say what would the

355
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,699
maximum length be and finally if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

356
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:36,418
consider the case that I've shown you

357
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,549
earlier of a provider issuing you're

358
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:42,789
causing this customer to be invalid well

359
00:17:39,549 --> 00:17:45,129
in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we would also indicate who</font>

360
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:47,649
the provider might be and<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch it and</font>

361
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:53,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">when what sort of war do it issue that</font>

362
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:56,289
causes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers to be invalid now</font>

363
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:59,409
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> side for for the water</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system</font>

364
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:02,289
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of an online and positive</font>

365
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:07,479
notification system that allows network

366
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:09,549
operators about bad or loose laws and so

367
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:12,220
we periodically retrieve their eyes from

368
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:15,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rpi publication points and compare</font>

369
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:20,109
them against the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP advertisements that</font>

370
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:23,830
let's be observed and so we identify and

371
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:25,629
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> identify problems so in case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of so in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">operator and cases bed was we would also</font>

374
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:34,209
allow them and sometimes the actual

375
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,609
offender and victim are not the same

376
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:38,440
organization so in particular that

377
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:40,720
provider and customer cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've shown</font>

378
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,690
you in these cases we would email both

379
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,879
sides and the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a pretty</font>

380
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:53,739
descriptive description of the of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> L</font>

381
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:56,918
and indeed we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will get some some</font>

382
00:18:53,739 --> 00:19:01,389
promising initial results so our emails

383
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:03,849
rate 168 victims and offenders and after

384
00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:05,889
within a<font color="#E5E5E5"> month we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> checked what what</font>

385
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:07,749
happened and about thirty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

386
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:11,168
forty-two percent of this I also

387
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:13,529
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed and this is a significant</font>

388
00:19:11,169 --> 00:19:15,909
ties which we believe is optimistic and

389
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:18,039
just to clarify some some of the

390
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:20,919
differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed from from other</font>

391
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:25,359
systems it is constantly monitoring so

392
00:19:20,919 --> 00:19:27,099
it's not just upon registration that you

393
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,619
might get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot and also it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not an</font>

394
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:31,599
opt-in so we constantly monitor and we

395
00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:35,259
are left whenever we see something

396
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's bad and so we are really advocate</font>

397
00:19:35,259 --> 00:19:39,830
the taller be

398
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:42,020
be adopted and adapted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

399
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:50,389
significant<font color="#E5E5E5"> and less academic body than</font>

400
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:52,879
us and so for the so far my talk has

401
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:56,000
focused mostly about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

402
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,780
that's publicly available in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FBI and</font>

403
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,270
there was and now I'm going to shift a

404
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:08,090
bit to the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides of the other side</font>

405
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:12,950
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rpki which is doing go out always</font>

406
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:15,020
in validation so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will show some</font>

407
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:17,960
first measurements that we have

408
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:21,920
regarding doing girl toys invitation and

409
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,470
then I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluate how good is</font>

410
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:28,960
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our PTI about the origin validation</font>

411
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:31,910
under partial deployment so let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

412
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,940
explain a bit what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means to do our</font>

413
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,920
origin validation according to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki</font>

414
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:41,030
and this is likely repeats previous

415
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:47,450
talks but<font color="#CCCCCC"> bear with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure you'd</font>

416
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:50,389
find interesting so so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that use the</font>

417
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:53,480
RPK I to do outdoors in validation or lv

418
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:56,330
the network administrator needs to set

419
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:59,720
up a local general<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose machine that</font>

420
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:03,860
runs some software which syncs with the

421
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">rpi publication points so it gets the</font>

422
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:09,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">LCS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and oils from this publication point</font>

423
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,580
and then it can it can actually by date

424
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:16,639
that the signatures are correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and for</font>

425
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:19,100
those records that are that are fine it

426
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,470
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> ke sort of a widely stores based</font>

427
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,719
on these walls and then it would push

428
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,400
them to the outer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routers within</font>

429
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,550
the anonymous system within the

430
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:30,350
autonomous system so really you can as

431
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:33,290
you can see the changes to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers</font>

432
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:37,969
are really minor and this is a big

433
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:40,580
differentiator from bgp sec so lady made

434
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:44,180
you answer a lot of windows and actually

435
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:47,120
supporting lv and today and it tells a

436
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:49,590
very negligible overhead so almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

437
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">aes anywhere can do our way</font>

438
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:54,658
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a fairly good start for a new</font>

439
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,059
security protocol so now we're

440
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:03,809
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in knowing is it actually</font>

441
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:07,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">being enforced so I will now show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

442
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:10,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of our measurements which we check out</font>

443
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:14,279
the which regard who is not doing Alvey

444
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:16,950
and specifically in order to gain some

445
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:20,010
empirical insights we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

446
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:24,870
invite advertisements that already exist

447
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:27,179
on the internet so unfortunately there

448
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:30,658
are a lot of those using the application

449
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:34,080
that surprises for our study and we

450
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:37,230
monitor those invite advertisements to

451
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:41,490
the past and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> past that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are observed</font>

452
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:44,520
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bible a few sensors so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

453
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:47,120
completely passive study and let me just

454
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:50,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">point out the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dozen can't be an ongoing</font>

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,949

456
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,539
active techniques so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

457
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,669
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that you might want to be</font>

458
00:22:54,539 --> 00:23:04,230
on the dog for that study when it

459
00:22:56,669 --> 00:23:06,299
finishes so to our measurements so

460
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:09,120
consider the following topology where we

461
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:11,929
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two origins and each of them</font>

462
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:16,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">advertiser's traffic that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is invalid</font>

463
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">according</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the RBI now in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this set</font>

466
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:27,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> AES data are not doing filtering so</font>

467
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:31,529
we only<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about those that do not</font>

468
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,010
discard invalid routes and to see who

469
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:37,649
the hooded guys are we simply observe

470
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:41,100
the route the invalid dog that the

471
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:43,649
invite advertisement steak and then we

472
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,070
can point out that all the ESS the<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

473
00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:51,120
ladies advertisements actually not doing

<font color="#E5E5E5">filtering according to the ArchiCAD so</font>

475
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,209
what did we<font color="#CCCCCC"> find well we found that at</font>

476
00:23:54,149 --> 00:23:59,789
least 80 out of the 100 largest ice

477
00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:01,049
please do not do filtering according to

478
00:23:59,789 --> 00:24:03,929
the RBI

479
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:06,570
and the reason that the time presenting

480
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:11,399
it focused results on this 100 largest I

481
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:13,200
space is a dual<font color="#E5E5E5"> so both because for</font>

482
00:24:11,399 --> 00:24:15,689
these particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> iced teas we can</font>

483
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,179
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a lot of paths let's go</font>

484
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">through it goes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o them so using this</font>

485
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:24,720
passive approach it's easier to learn

486
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:27,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">about them and the second one is as i'm</font>

487
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,249
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you in the remainder of my</font>

488
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:32,129
talk is that these guys turn out to be

489
00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:37,169
very important for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security benefits</font>

00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:39,988
<font color="#CCCCCC">of WT</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i can provide so we've also asked</font>

493
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:50,340
see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers pretty much confirm</font>

494
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:53,248
what we've seen so about eighty-five

495
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,709
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of M sub know about ten percent</font>

496
00:24:53,249 --> 00:24:59,850
have answered yes but too deep but only

497
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:01,590
to do prefer invalid<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and and only</font>

498
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,299
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> five percent have indicated that</font>

499
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:06,149
they use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to be scouting</font>

500
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:08,580
invite the advertisements now let me

501
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:11,758
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this this ten percent</font>

502
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,859
was who are doing different friends well

503
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,749
it was shown that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the purpose actually</font>

504
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:19,730
does not help at all against a prefix

505
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:22,859
hijacks and because in that case you

506
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:24,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">would only be informed of one perfect so</font>

507
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,879
Eddie you would be persuade you don't

508
00:25:24,989 --> 00:25:29,519
have anything to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do prefer it with and</font>

509
00:25:26,879 --> 00:25:32,309
so you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the s would fall</font>

510
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,710
victim to the attack and also in case

511
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:36,269
you only have one provider that

512
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,149
connected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet well you might</font>

513
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:42,029
only receive one<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertisement and four</font>

514
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:49,668
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the perfect and therefore again and</font>

515
00:25:42,029 --> 00:25:51,929
we would take it so so as we've seen

516
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:55,440
deployment of our way seems very

517
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:57,960
powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so now the question is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

518
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,629
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our V under partial deployment</font>

519
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,720
and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the security benefits that</font>

520
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:08,759
we might expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from it under</font>

521
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:11,590
such deployment scenarios and we we

522
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:14,919
identify two interesting collateral

523
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:18,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">X so the first one is the collateral</font>

524
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:21,429
benefit effect well<font color="#E5E5E5"> where doctors might</font>

525
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:25,029
be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> protect AES is behind them in</font>

526
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:28,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet apology just by discarding</font>

527
00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:31,179
invited out so consider this simple

528
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,840
topology so we have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacker in the</font>

529
00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:37,809
attacker at a 666 and the legitimate

530
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,520
specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> shown as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s1 and the the owner</font>

531
00:26:37,809 --> 00:26:46,418
has a row are published so so anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

532
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:49,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">is doing lv knows about this one and in</font>

533
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:54,640
particular considered a<font color="#CCCCCC"> two who is doing</font>

534
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:57,580
lv and as3 who does not so so what's

535
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,049
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen when so let us assume</font>

536
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,620
that the attacker tries to do a

537
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:05,649
soporific psychic well now the day is

538
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:10,360
doing lv @ as2 we will actually discard

539
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:12,340
that advertisement and so when their

540
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,820
origin<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertiser's it to unclip fix the</font>

541
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:21,129
/ 16 that that advertisement will reach

542
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:24,070
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 and therefore if a is only offered</font>

543
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,289
the good route it will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be fooled and</font>

544
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:29,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">will actually topic will actually flow</font>

545
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:32,559
in the right direction so that is a

546
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:37,000
pretty good effect that accusing our<font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font>

547
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:39,279
might have now let me talk about the

548
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,990
collateral damage damaging in fact that

549
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:46,570
we've seen so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> collateral damage</font>

550
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:49,659
means that in our context means that a

551
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:53,439
esas who are not doing lv might actually

552
00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:56,679
cause damage to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS who are doing our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font>

553
00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:01,600
so to demonstrate that I've swapped a SS

554
00:27:56,679 --> 00:28:04,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">s 2 and s 3 so now a two the does not</font>

555
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,529
adopt and there's not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our v well</font>

556
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:14,940
s3 does and the first type of collateral

557
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:18,580
damage attack show is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this connection so</font>

558
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:21,010
so by this connection let let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

559
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:23,919
consider the case where a<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to actually</font>

560
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,710
prefers to take out to other

561
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">love zombie attack you at 666 the other</font>

562
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:34,090
than out from the origin and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now let's</font>

563
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:36,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider the case where the origin</font>

564
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:38,399
announces its critics the<font color="#CCCCCC"> select 16 and</font>

565
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:41,710
the attacker performs a physics hi jack

566
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:45,910
well in that case<font color="#E5E5E5"> aah two will actually</font>

567
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:48,670
announce the bed love to as3 and since

568
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:52,000
s3 is performing there will be it<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

569
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:54,310
know to<font color="#CCCCCC"> discover this out and since it's</font>

570
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,350
not being often offered any other of it

573
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:08,430
stew had actually caused a esli to

00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:11,080
disconnect<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you might say well</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this connection is better than reaching</font>

576
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,300
to the meeting the wrong the wrong guess

577
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,340
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i prefer not to send my</font>

578
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:22,060
traffic at all then then actually having

579
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:24,790
it reached the wrong destination but

580
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,919
actually using<font color="#E5E5E5"> our V and the partial</font>

581
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:30,399
deployments might cause control plane

582
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:32,680
and data plan mismatch and and that

583
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,260
means well consider the same the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exact</font>

584
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:38,230
same scenario except now the attacker is

585
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:41,500
performing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a start with exciting well</font>

586
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:43,870
now a stool is to advertisements and

587
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:46,000
they are so different prefixes one is

588
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,729
for the / 16 and the other one is for

589
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,510
the / 24 and therefore it will followed

590
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,210
both of them to a spray now every doing

591
00:29:52,510 --> 00:30:00,580
outdoor invalidation would know to

592
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:02,590
discard<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attackers out and therefore</font>

593
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,889
it would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose to take the</font>

594
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:10,959
correct path when when sending traffic

00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:14,860
to 21 dot one dot<font color="#E5E5E5"> once that's 24 for so</font>

596
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,860
for the subtopics but once<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic</font>

597
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,770
reaches as2 in a is too stable it

598
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,750
actually says the<font color="#CCCCCC"> discuss 24 prefix</font>

599
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:25,900
action needs to be output to the

600
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:28,480
attacker so since we don't have saw

601
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:31,690
something on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet traffic will</font>

602
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,260
actually flow or against the decision of

603
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:40,670
Si and<font color="#CCCCCC"> reacted</font>

604
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:43,010
attacker so the last thing that we that

605
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,860
we've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this study is to quantify</font>

606
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:49,190
this collateral damaging and collateral

607
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:51,189
benefit and effect and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to do</font>

608
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,800
that we've used the simulation framework

609
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:58,960
which takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet gas as well as</font>

610
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:03,470
the installed relations between<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS and</font>

611
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:06,410
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> simulations work as follows so every</font>

612
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:10,930
time we take one doctor and one big dumb

613
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:14,870
 and we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the victim has</font>

614
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:19,070
to protect its play fix and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick</font>

615
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:21,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">some a doctor set a different one for</font>

616
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,669
each type of simulations that we are

617
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you a few</font>

618
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:29,570
later and then we evaluate which of the

619
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:32,540
AES is on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet we choose to out</font>

620
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:35,030
the traffic to the attacker and which to

621
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,950
the victim so that would give us<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

622
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:41,720
attacker success rate which is sort of a

623
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:44,120
measure of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how good alvey's under this</font>

624
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:47,390
partial deployment and we repeat that

625
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:54,340
for about a 4 million victim and attack

626
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:59,480
hotels so so first off let me start by

627
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:02,209
by saying by quantifying the<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

628
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,170
benefits that we gain by having the top

629
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,940
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> speed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> adopt so by top I space i mean</font>

630
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:09,530
the the I speeds on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internets</font>

631
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:13,250
ordered by the number of clients that

632
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:18,320
they have and and here you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

633
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:21,080
lines so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> green line means that every</font>

634
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,870
isp adopts with probability every top is

635
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">period of the probability 1 while the</font>

636
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:30,290
red line means that every top i speared

637
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:33,440
of the probability<font color="#CCCCCC"> one quarter the x</font>

638
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:35,720
axis means the expected deployment so in

639
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,640
order to compare these two lines we

640
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">really wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have the same size of</font>

641
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:44,000
deployment so if you take the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 point</font>

642
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:45,950
for example for the green line that

643
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,070
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the 100</font>

644
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:51,169
tapai speeds have adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alby was for</font>

645
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:56,240
the red line it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the</font>

646
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:58,279
top 400<font color="#E5E5E5"> so not 100 412 I squeeze each</font>

647
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,600
one of them had adopted with probability

648
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:04,850
one quarter and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> these these two</font>

649
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,820
deployment sets are expected to be equal

650
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:11,389
yet as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see the significant</font>

651
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:13,580
difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so while having</font>

652
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:17,000
a 25-percent a dachshund right by the

653
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:21,039
top I space does not substantially harm

654
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,450
that mitigate the attackers the attack

655
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:27,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the subway fixed attack is almost</font>

656
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:33,740
completely mitigated when the top 100 I

657
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:36,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">squeeze adopt for the subtopics hijack</font>

658
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,260
you can see the same the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so</font>

659
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:41,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">really again the red line well in this</font>

660
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,919
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost does not move this is</font>

661
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,908
precisely<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of that collateral</font>

662
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:48,710
damaging effect while the what the Green

663
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:52,880
Line shows that the attack is the

664
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">meanest now in there we have an online</font>

665
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,010
technical report the technical report

666
00:33:55,070 --> 00:34:00,379
has has some more details about these

667
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:04,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">these simulations that also includes</font>

668
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:07,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">some all data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> points so and so you can</font>

669
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">see that it's about 75% the doc</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tonight</font>

670
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,989
this gets very close to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the green line</font>

671
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:20,418
while the fifty percent will still

672
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:22,939
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> close to the red line so and then</font>

673
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:26,359
the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> simulations that i want to show</font>

674
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:29,480
you compare between between two

675
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:31,489
scenarios so one is today's status as

676
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,579
reflected by all measurements that's the

677
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:39,259
that's the red line and that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

678
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:41,869
a yes is that do not adopt that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

679
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:45,829
that are not doing our<font color="#CCCCCC"> V filtering</font>

680
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:48,889
continue not to do that and while the

681
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:53,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">green line suggest that all the top ice</font>

682
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:56,119
please start doing our be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x axis</font>

683
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,640
describes now the adoption<font color="#E5E5E5"> rate of our</font>

684
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:59,000
weakest link in the reminder of the

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,109
intern

686
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,850
so x axis as one means that actually

687
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:11,690
everyone everyone we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know to not</font>

688
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:15,529
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I will be start doing our way and and</font>

689
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:18,620
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the tremendous effect of</font>

690
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:22,730
this collateral damage so for the subway

00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:25,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">fix hijack even if everyone adopt it</font>

692
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:28,310
seems that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> substantial</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of the</font>

694
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:34,160
all the traffic to the wrong direction

695
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:37,820
because of the collateral damaging

697
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,730

hand is actually quite optimistic it

700
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:51,830
shows that if we just get<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one</font>

701
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guys to adopt what that means</font>

702
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:58,700
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> death occurred success</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rate is</font>

703
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:01,940
rather low and it continues to diminish

704
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:07,580
until 04 that attackers more and more

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:27,710
necessary and very importantly also

713
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:31,820
sufficient to provide some substantial

<font color="#E5E5E5">security benefit from the RPK I so I</font>

715
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:37,820
actually view this is some very good

716
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:39,670
news because that means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we that</font>

focused effort and instant dividing

718
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:46,660
incentivizing these guys to adopt might

719
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:52,120
actually provide some critical benefits

720
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:55,879
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just conclude my talk so I</font>

721
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:58,549
vice to issues regarding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RBI one is</font>

727
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:15,950
ways we can use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpi to</font>

728
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,799
to prevent hijacks better and we found

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:21,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that incentivizing our V adoption by the</font>

730
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,829
top I space is actually very critical

731
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:29,150
and is both sufficient and necessary for

732
00:37:24,829 --> 00:37:42,200
significant benefits so with that I'll

733
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:44,960

that one ah<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so on the loose rollers</font>

739
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:13,730
I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of remarks</font>

740
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:18,200
i was around and in the room when the

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:20,390
max length was kind of inserted the

single bit instead of it and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

744
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:31,540
obviously much worse because that

745
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:34,880
enables accept all more specifics

747
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:42,549
that would have been a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad idea i</font>

748
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:48,680
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> agree okay so kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

00:38:42,549 --> 00:38:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the argument why injecting the next</font>

751
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:58,630
enumerate exactly what they want to

00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:02,869
announce was based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the experience</font>

753
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:07,250
with customers that we asked to actually

00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:09,650
do in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl exact enumerate exact</font>

00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:14,299
registration of all the routes they

756
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:16,790
wanted to announce and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some</font>

757
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:18,190
operators actually are pretty rigid on

758
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,400
it

759
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:24,610
and we probably belong there but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

760
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:28,840
that it's painful and kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font>

761
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:33,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of giving people who really want to be a</font>

little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit lazy on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> choice of making</font>

763
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:39,370
them more vulnerable for the form for

764
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:44,380
for having a little bit more comfort in

765
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:49,480
doing the registry this<font color="#E5E5E5"> theme did seem</font>

766
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:53,050
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much justified in the</font>

767
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:56,080
real world and I'm quite sure and quite

768
00:39:53,050 --> 00:40:00,520
sure that hole however the education to

769
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:03,250
this and explaining if you do the robot

770
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:06,340
for things you are not intending to

771
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:10,150
actually announce you are creating

772
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:13,600
vulnerability are probably has to be

773
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:16,150
emphasized more so thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

774
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">comment I actually love to continue</font>

775
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,920
talking maybe offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this max</font>

776

777
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:26,050
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-up work on that and enough</font>

778
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:32,080
to get a opening I think for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter</font>

779
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:38,140
orc stuff that you mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> i note i</font>

780
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:42,430
note that the design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rpki kinds</font>

781
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:45,120
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mirrors pretty precisely the theory</font>

782
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:49,600
of how the Internet addresses are

783
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:54,040
allocated assigned and assigned and it

784
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:57,299
seems kind of the only reasonable

785
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:02,830
approach to keep that matching however

786
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:06,100
are the parts of the rpki system that

787
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:08,140
allowed allegation that essentially

788
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:14,910
matches the delegation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the address</font>

789
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:18,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">space is not really used a lot actually</font>

790
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:20,170
right from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom it's not you right</font>

791
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:23,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the from the top of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the delegation</font>

792
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:25,349
three it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not used and for the lower</font>

793
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,910
layers there are only very few

794
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:31,829
example of delegation and there are

795
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,859
quite obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are quite</font>

796
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:38,819
obviously some challenges of doing that

797
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:44,009
and then of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course there is a lot of</font>

798
00:41:38,819 --> 00:41:48,450
legacy problems not many operators have

799
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:52,170
had have held a policy that for their ph

800
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:56,430
scale actually portable assignments to

801
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:59,220
customers cannot be done most people

802
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:06,569
have some legacy there and cleaning and

803
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:08,729
dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is just a pain so so</font>

804
00:42:06,569 --> 00:42:11,460
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

805
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:13,739
is room for<font color="#CCCCCC"> improvement in doing that so</font>

806
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,479
of course as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

807
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,130
measurements indicate that the problem

808
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:19,859
is not that big the tree is quite

809
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:22,440
shallow as you point out I do think that

810
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:25,049
there is room for for improvements in

811
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,680
the oil so in particular our research

812
00:42:25,049 --> 00:42:30,450
paper also suggests and you think called

813
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:33,509
the wild card wall that might be able to

814
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:35,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely remove this download</font>

815
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:37,410
dependencies that I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> told you about</font>

816
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:43,849
I'd be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy to talk about that</font>

817
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:48,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">viewing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bike okay okay so let's go</font>

818
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:50,880
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> map it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back yahoo would</font>

819
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:55,140
hopefully an easy question what is the

820
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:58,170
top 100 ISPs how did you define us oh ok

821
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,598
so we've simply we've simply looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

822
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:02,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i squeezing the internet apologies</font>

823
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:07,079
so kayla has this in fairies

824
00:43:02,969 --> 00:43:09,359
installations topology and then the sort

825
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">of in spelling who is the customer of</font>

826
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">whom on the internet so take it so given</font>

827
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:17,279
this huge list of all the essence we've

828
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:20,549
sorted them by the number of customers

829
00:43:17,279 --> 00:43:22,589
that ejs has and the top 100 of that

830
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:24,719
list are basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> team what size</font>

831
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:26,099
the customer just the number of customer

832
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:29,160
the number of customers

833
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:32,160
that so so a customer with massive

834
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,779
prefix blocks that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only one customer</font>

835
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,598
gets counted the same as somebody within

836
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:40,849
these tiny prefix in our account yes ah

837
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:40,849
thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that clarification of it</font>

sixteen percent of the people who

843

responded said they employed<font color="#CCCCCC"> our ppi in</font>

some fashion they<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked their names I</font>

00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:16,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this this result as we</font>

847
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,619
also pointed out in the technical report

848
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:23,339
is quite optimistic and that is because

849
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:27,059
the the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are likely to respond</font>

850
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:29,339
and the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> were likely to be on</font>

851
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:32,130
the mailing list and fall so big that

852
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:34,049
they were live they were closing they

853
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,759
types on keyboard well excellent

854
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:37,529
actually I cannot give you the names

855
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:39,539
because the thing is completely

find this optimistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> tile and we also</font>

858
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:48,989
find some evidence that there are some

00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:53,479
people who are doing lv you can read

860
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:56,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">those paper</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that ok I'll somewhat</font>

861
00:44:53,479 --> 00:45:00,299
in joke but it is interesting that their

862
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:04,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">actions were positive responses let's</font>

863
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:06,900
see about your intro organizational

864
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:09,509
dependencies and finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that people</font>

00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,400
find rowers that disenfranchised their

866
00:45:09,509 --> 00:45:14,130
customers yes it has been a noted

867
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,410
problem for many times at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least two</font>

868
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:18,579
implementations right Pendragon research

871
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:27,410
you know the chair is validating the

872
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:30,529
following route from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing table</font>

873
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:33,500
and maybe you want to rethink them so

874
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:37,339
yeah the human error does come into into

875
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:41,960
play your collateral damage slides you

876
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:44,450
were talking about the one doing origin

877
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:47,480
validation that only gets bad routes

878
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:49,700
will be disconnected<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's being</font>

879
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:52,700
disconnected from the attacker if it

880
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,200
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the origin validation it</font>

881
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,169
wouldn't the traffic wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be getting</font>

882
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,629
were wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be getting any way</font>

883
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:03,190
exactly so I I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that so if</font>

884
00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:07,549
the if a is<font color="#CCCCCC"> too in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example was</font>

885
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:09,289
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing yeah so if it was doing</font>

886
00:46:07,549 --> 00:46:11,509
then that damage which would have been

887
00:46:09,289 --> 00:46:16,220
avoided the damage is actually in a stew

888
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:18,260
not doing that yes and yes the second

889
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,270
thing is the second collateral damage

890
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">was because the control plane of the</font>

891
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:25,210
data plane were not in sync and<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand to</font>

892
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:31,839
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> who thought that was a surprise</font>

893
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:35,270
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and ok</font>

894
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:40,400
the final thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there's a quote in</font>

895
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:43,910
your paper that I've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that at the</font>

896
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:47,119
same title you say you expose a new

897
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:50,899
security vulnerability I would you like

898
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:54,710
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> most emphatically this is not a</font>

899
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:57,910
security vulnerability in rpki and it's

900
00:46:54,710 --> 00:47:00,289
not a secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> attivo her ability in</font>

901
00:46:57,910 --> 00:47:04,450
origin validation it's a Miss

902
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:07,640
configuration by the operator<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known</font>

903
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:10,220
mentioned in the ops documents you

904
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:13,328
quoted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ops document it's something</font>

905
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:15,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's been known for a long time</font>

906
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:21,079
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of an overstatement to say</font>

907
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:24,640
you expose a new security vulnerability

908
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:28,460
or four<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those things are</font>

909
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:33,080
yeah the ops document is about five

910
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:38,000
years old okay well okay thank you for

911
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:39,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what I'm sorry google that</font>

912
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,119
might kind of be following on from what

913
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,160
sandy says because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i didn't really</font>

914
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">coordinate with her but you sort of</font>

915
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:50,480
mentioned this RC 7115 sort of vaguely

916
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:53,180
mentions the blue stroller things the

917
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 7-1 on five specifically actually</font>

918
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,750
points out if you do this you're going

919
00:47:55,369 --> 00:47:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be shooting yourself in the foot and</font>

920
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:01,730
this the operator actually asked for

921
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:03,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that don't generate the longer prefix so</font>

922
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:05,840
yes that's information that people met

923
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:07,640
but you know to some extent if you give

924
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">people a powerful tool they will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shoot</font>

925
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,850
themselves in the foot until they learn

926
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:13,880
that that hook and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully</font>

927
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:18,460
they'll start well the RC actually

928
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:22,520
mentions that and says specifically that

929
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:26,540
this attack is you to open your search

930
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:30,520
to an attack that's more likely to be

931
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:33,140
sort of going out under the radar I

932
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:35,119
think it's very important to emphasize

933
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:39,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is actually more likely to</font>

934
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,820
succeed as well I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect you might</font>

935
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,530
have but I think I wrote some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

936
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,600
text<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay i don't understood that it</font>

937
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:46,400
says that it's more likely to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> note or</font>

938
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:49,368
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> made two days maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it wasn't clear</font>

939
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,890
is that if somebody manages to hijack

940
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:53,840
the 16 that will be more likely to be

941
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:57,200
noticed mum or that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> written</font>

942
00:48:53,840 --> 00:49:03,260
very well<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the way it is</font>

943
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:05,330
yep freedom list ha and yes RFC 7115

944
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:09,290
indeed makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear if you have</font>

945
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:11,930
a flash point again and the / 24 and you

946
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:14,720
should essentially you only<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced</font>

947
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:18,230
those two and no other more specifics

948
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:19,578
you should be clearly states that you

949
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:22,069
should try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ish</font>

950
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:24,049
separate rollers for them that will

951
00:49:22,069 --> 00:49:28,099
provide the<font color="#E5E5E5"> maximum protection from this</font>

952
00:49:24,049 --> 00:49:31,788
forged origin attack my other question

953
00:49:28,099 --> 00:49:34,249
is when you do the collateral damage

954
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:38,650
studies you could do a sensitive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

955
00:49:34,249 --> 00:49:38,649
sensitivity analysis with regard to the

956
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:45,709
discard policy so you can you can have

957
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:48,410
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases one you prefer invalid and the</font>

958
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:50,328
other one you discarded when I didn't

959
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:54,170
look like it in the river invalid steady

960
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:56,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">video so know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this entire study</font>

961
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:59,599
actually focuses on the owner discard

962
00:49:56,959 --> 00:50:02,118
invalid so what would happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

963
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,969
would do this card invalid yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

964
00:50:02,119 --> 00:50:07,309
just suggesting that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there to make it</font>

965
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:09,799
compile it might be useful to do a

966
00:50:07,309 --> 00:50:12,680
sensitivity sensitivity analysis

967
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:16,640
consider both cases what happens if you

968
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:19,279
have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> d prep yeah i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree we probably</font>

969
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,558
should should do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think the reason</font>

970
00:50:19,279 --> 00:50:24,619
we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of didn't is because of this</font>

971
00:50:21,559 --> 00:50:26,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">beeper spell invalid would actually be</font>

972
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:29,209
completely vulnerable to satwiksai Jax

973
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:31,640
and I think when we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done that we've</font>

974
00:50:29,209 --> 00:50:34,160
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> chosen because of that we've</font>

975
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:40,670
chosen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus but I I definitely agree</font>

976
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:43,999
so it is interesting to to show I just

977
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:46,069
want to say just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we're going to close</font>

978
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:48,649
the mics<font color="#CCCCCC"> literally the last questions</font>

979
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:51,650
they can get into the breakfast<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Lou</font>

980
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:55,130
you go Fort Dodge telecom again so let

981
00:50:51,650 --> 00:51:03,039
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> close with a rare kind of positive</font>

982
00:50:55,130 --> 00:51:06,979
comment from me your your idea of

983
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:11,809
monitoring and reporting on what's out

984
00:51:06,979 --> 00:51:14,149
there quite certainly is heading in a

985
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:19,609
direction where we need to do a little

986
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:23,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of work for me I have to say I</font>

987
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:26,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't respond to you guys sending our</font>

988
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:28,239
operations a report at some point in

989
00:51:26,209 --> 00:51:28,239
time

990
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:35,200
hell well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I didn't see much of an</font>

991
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:39,790
advancement beyond what the ripe NCC is

992
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:43,720
giving me daily but kind of I'm seeing

993
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:47,230
I'm seeing actually a reason for diving

994
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:49,390
a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> deeper into what we</font>

995
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:53,200
actually should take as a requirement

996
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:55,660
for monitoring and reporting I think I

997
00:51:53,200 --> 00:52:00,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I think there is actually a little</font>

998
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:01,899
bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done and to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it an</font>

999
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:06,010
