Sunday and after walking around for some

afterwards I realized that saying my

me ask you something else why it is

important to know if a stressful part

this work we propose a new tool tricks

out on how to detect and identify if and

deployed this tool in Python 3 of course

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,490
it's open source so everyone can

78
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:03,130
of treasure path in order to infer with

existing shortcomings also tracks out

88
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:42,340
supports direct communication with the

89
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,910
ripe Atlas infrastructure which means

90
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:49,900
that through the tool you can create or

91
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,760
even face measurements from the ripe

92
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,969
Atlas database in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyze them</font>

93
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:58,200
and then to see where you have an extra

94
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:02,230
crossing or possible extra crossings

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">execution in the interest part most</font>

96
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,870
importantly in the last major revision

97
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,710
of our tool will also add a new

98
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,800
functionality actually tricks out

99
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:17,109
supports remote peering identification

100
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">this means that after we have detected</font>

an axpy crossing we can also infer if

102
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:28,300
the near end I remember is also a remote

103
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:33,370
piece this functionality is mainly based

104
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:35,680
on data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a new tool the name of</font>

110
00:06:49,529 --> 00:07:00,509
involved and the capability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this tool</font>

111
00:06:53,369 --> 00:07:04,769
is to detect and geo locate the remote

00:07:04,769 --> 00:07:10,229
the modular design and this is something

00:07:07,049 --> 00:07:12,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">that allow us to easily extend the duel</font>

with new XP detection capabilities and

116
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:19,198
of course it offers flexibility to the

117
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:23,069
users to<font color="#CCCCCC"> configure the tool based on the</font>

in the third module in which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

175
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:21,699
deployed our methodology you notice that

00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:25,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">it consists of three main steps so to</font>

better understand how<font color="#E5E5E5"> all this process</font>

178
00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:33,399
and works let's see some more details

179
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:36,879
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this step for each step particularly</font>

180
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:40,600
in the first step we try to find an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ax</font>

183
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:51,149
do that assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have a sample</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

184
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:53,589
a tracer path from the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> module and</font>

185
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:57,429
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do here</font>

186
00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:00,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to use a sliding window hope window</font>

187
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:02,889
of size 2<font color="#CCCCCC"> or 3 ip's let's say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

188
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:06,309
example that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have set it to set it to</font>

189
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:09,009
size of three now for the top window we

190
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,860
apply our methodology with shaky we

191
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:14,320
check for AXA crossings

192
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,450
we slide the window again<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd apply</font>

193
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,230
methodology we infer that our results

194
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,840
and so on so assuming again that we have

195
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:25,840
a sample<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hop window of the treasure</font>

196
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:30,190
path so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to</font>

197
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:33,460
do here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to check if then if the</font>

198
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:37,720
middle IP is nice crappie and how we do

199
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,420
that we tell if this IP is included in

200
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,600
the X members data or belongs an active

201
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:48,490
practice let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have a hit</font>

202
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:51,370
for our<font color="#CCCCCC"> jump now in the second step we</font>

203
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:55,540
translate<font color="#CCCCCC"> their path when a spot and</font>

204
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:59,200
then we search if they a they asses a

205
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:04,270
dozen to the x AP are also members to

206
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:07,390
that I XP having this hog window from

207
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:10,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the previous step we map the border I</font>

208
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:14,350
piece to as numbers based on traffic

209
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:17,979
space mappings and then we check if

210
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:21,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">these cases are members to the candidate</font>

211
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:26,470
I XP that we have in the middle by using

212
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:30,390
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AXI my basic data and now in the</font>

213
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:33,370
third step we take the final<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision</font>

214
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:39,400
gathering all the information from the

215
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:46,710
previous step we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to say if and</font>

216
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:53,439
as with hope in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trespass but we have</font>

217
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:57,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this XP crossing of course taking into</font>

218
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:02,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">account our methodology he noticed that</font>

219
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:05,410
to infer this discussing links we have

220
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:09,189
to do two main things the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is</font>

221
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to check what information with you have</font>

222
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:17,830
and also what requirements are satisfied

223
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:20,290
so for this reason we formulated values

224
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:22,720
XP detection rules and we split<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

225
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,560
into two groups in strong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and weak</font>

226
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,640
evidon

227
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:31,739
truth to better understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

228
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:34,180
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these rules let's see some exams</font>

229
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,130
consider Jenn that we have a sample of

230
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">hope window with an axe type in the</font>

231
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:44,350
middle so a strong evidence rule

232
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:47,140
requires AAS information for all the

233
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:50,800
status and especially for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle one</font>

234
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:53,949
based on actionable data and if the

235
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:56,140
board<font color="#E5E5E5"> races are members to the XP with</font>

236
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:58,900
the first ways numbers to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

237
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:01,630
we can say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dude is HUD fight</font>

238
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:07,630
and then we infer that we have crossed

239
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:10,420
an XP in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first hope of the hope</font>

240
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:15,939
window I mean in<font color="#E5E5E5"> other words before the</font>

241
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:20,380
XIV<font color="#E5E5E5"> agric evidence rule does not require</font>

242
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:24,580
a information for all the three<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> piece</font>

243
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:28,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">and also for the third one notable</font>

244
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:31,270
member to the XP again is this truly

245
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,330
satisfied we can say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cross</font>

246
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the XP but of course now we claim this</font>

247
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:42,220
results with lower evidence and now in

248
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,560
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fourth module collecting all our</font>

249
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,770
information from the previous steps and

250
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,479
modules we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to formulate it of course</font>

251
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:54,360
after the path analysis we try to

252
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:58,089
formulate the output of a tool and

argument the first thing that the tool

256
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:10,780
can print is a short dialogue about want

information we keep in our database in

258
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:18,990
order to make all the personalities and

259
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:24,900
then we print the candidate racial path

260
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:28,060
augmented with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS with some a</font>

importantly at the bottom with

264
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:45,540
of all the XP cross-links and of course

265
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:48,300
the inferred remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering links for</font>

268
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:01,439

270
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,640
used a 30 million probes provided by

271
