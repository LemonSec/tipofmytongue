first of all I'd like to thank you for

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:28,779
the opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about low</font>

balancing with session persistence also

5
00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:36,010
about the opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use one of the</font>

15
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:19,810
business about the load balancer is a

16
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:23,649
common technique we use to ensure high

17
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:28,570
availability<font color="#E5E5E5"> and good performance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font>

22
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:51,189
have literally hundreds of law balances

23
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:55,329
the number of door balancer in a major

24
00:01:51,189 --> 00:02:01,389
financial institution like Wells Fargo

25
00:01:55,329 --> 00:02:04,928
can reach<font color="#CCCCCC"> as dire as a 1000 and it's</font>

26
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:07,389
also possible when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you are skating out</font>

27
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:10,690

28
00:02:07,389 --> 00:02:14,920

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:19,200
more powerful global answer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no</font>

30
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,200
more connections more traffic

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:27,700
so it's natural to ask whether there is

32
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:30,019
a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve the performance of</font>

34
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:34,870
more connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> about higher throughput</font>

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,340
usually when we talk about session

36
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:47,410
persistence it means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:51,590
direct all the traffic's from a single

38
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:53,959
crime in a single TCP session to the

39
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:57,200
same server unless you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have something in</font>

the back end to<font color="#E5E5E5"> GRU different connection</font>

41
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,690
together however there are circumstances

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:08,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are the session position is</font>

43
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:12,590
not that easy we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tray one of the middle of</font>

45
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:21,110
the throughput in civil forum is limited

46
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,989
by their the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that travel</font>

47
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,459
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crime to the server and the</font>

traffic from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server back to the</font>

49
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:30,859
crime has to go through a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> device</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">load</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> balancer and of course there are</font>

51
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:35,170
some exceptions<font color="#E5E5E5"> like DSR director return</font>

52
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:48,109
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a wonderful scenario that is not</font>

53
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:50,560
easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> our to do session persistence for</font>

54
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:55,690
example in enterprise or ISP network

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:04:00,859
there could be a proxy server mega proxy

56
00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:04,730
that a crime access the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application will</font>

57
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:06,919
open multiple TCP connections and those

58
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:10,010
are different TCP connection can

59
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:12,709
actually go through different proxy

60
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:17,060
servers and the load balancer will have

61
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:19,820
some issue to deal with the fact that

62
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:23,720
you need to direct those are different

63
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:27,650
connection to the same server because a

64
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,770
proxy server mega proxy worldly<font color="#CCCCCC"> praise</font>

65
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,080
the source address of the crime to its

66
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,500
own address so the lower balance out

67
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:39,740
see two different IP and it was thought

68
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:42,259
that it would think that that's a two

69
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:46,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">different crimes and therefore the</font>

70
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:50,270
application can get broken and can also

71
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:52,849
happen that there are many many

72
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,979
connections come in to into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

73
00:04:52,849 --> 00:04:59,389
balancer with the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address</font>

74
00:04:54,979 --> 00:05:01,699
because proxy server proxy and change

75
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:04,969
the IP address of the incoming traffic

76
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:09,440
and the low balance will send all the

77
00:05:04,969 --> 00:05:10,520
traffic to the same server and in that

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,830
case you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good load</font>

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:20,770
balancing there and we talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

80
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:27,948
one ecommerce application particularly

81
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">require session positions particularly</font>

82
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:35,810
when you are transitioning from HTTP to

83
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:38,299
HTTPS there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> many ways that we can do</font>

84
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:40,370
the persistence for example as I

85
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,099
mentioned you could have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucket and</font>

86
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:48,409
storage or<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> database and use it</font>

87
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:52,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a crew so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can still maintain</font>

88
00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:55,819
the state information or you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

89
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:59,180
some middleware that grew multi-server

90
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:02,029
together so that it would look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

91
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:08,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">single server and probably the most</font>

92
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:11,589
common is use SSL accelerator the<font color="#CCCCCC"> truck</font>

93
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:14,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">way will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> directed directly into the</font>

94
00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:20,830
accelerator and decrypt it and send it

95
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:24,979
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the balancer and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because now the</font>

96
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:28,818
trophies are encrypted therefore the

97
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:32,690
load balancer can look ended up packet

98
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:36,780
particularly the cookie and use that as

99
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:41,580
a tool are for persistence

100
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:44,909
but is important not that in now what is

101
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:49,050
internet for example the smartphone the

102
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:52,280
cookie usually turn off by default so

103
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:58,130
this mechanism of cookie switching I

104
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,130
will not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> buried in that scenario</font>

105
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:09,780
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about that the</font>

108
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:24,419

109
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:27,810
it's already coming but according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

110
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:31,080
google ipv6 statistic we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

115
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:45,809
probably will be around<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five</font>

116
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:50,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent so basic is coming and it makes</font>

117
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:54,060
sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we look into a way that we</font>

can improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> their load balancing in the</font>

coming ipv6 world

120
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:10,308
in

121
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:15,629
the dental option is defined in RFC 2460

122
00:08:10,309 --> 00:08:17,249
its former is such as such I believe

123
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:21,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone is familiar with this you</font>

124
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:24,210
define the options the option type and

125
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:27,629
then the option<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's advantages of</font>

126
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:34,348
the information going to be contained<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

127
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:38,760
the options<font color="#CCCCCC"> and here is a proposal that</font>

128
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:45,060
we would defy our option<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's called low</font>

129
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:47,430
balancing session persistent options by

130
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:52,369
the way the<font color="#CCCCCC"> distances your option can</font>

131
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,370
only be examined by the distinction note

132
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,470
so here

133
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:04,150
we look at this a picture earlier we

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:11,390
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> if this is an IP before</font>

135
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:14,990
traffic because the different<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

136
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:18,050
connection issue by the same crime could

137
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,850
go through different proxy servers and

138
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:26,060
it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent to two different</font>

139
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:32,180
servers however in the ipv6 world are we

140
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:36,530
can have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

141
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:42,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">extension header so that when the packet</font>

142
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:45,819
is sent to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server or to the bleep of</font>

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:49,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the load balancer it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> include the</font>

144
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:56,270
destination ocean and there are two view

145
00:09:49,640 --> 00:10:00,800
in destination option one is a ipv6

146
00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:04,130
address or the crime<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the second</font>

147
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:10,160

165
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,540
of the pocket instead it can go into

166
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:24,010
that distinction header to look at the

167
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:28,120
source IP address source ipv6 address so

168
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:31,959
that you can still have this source

169
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:34,540
address persistence there and they are

170
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:39,060
they can set be sent to the same server

171
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,060
and maintain your session persistence

172
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:54,790
here is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture so when the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pocket is</font>

00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:11,019
proxy or could be transparent proxy and

177
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:15,459
low balance when the global get this a

178
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:18,639

of the ipv6 packet but the ipv6 address

181
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:33,880
are in that destination hello because at

this point of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time the distinct address</font>

183
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,550
of that packet actual use of with

184
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:42,100
address of the load balancer so the load

185
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:46,500
balancer is a destination he has a right

186
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:51,850
to examine that destination header and

187
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:54,399
therefore the public will go no matter

188
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,430
whether that's going through proxy one

is going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and here because</font>

that responding service v6s race is in a

there the robot<font color="#E5E5E5"> can simply just for the</font>

with this possibility the low bars

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">self-explanatory and here is that</font>

222
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:43,149
illustration of how the load balancer

223
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:46,990
the session persistence if I walk the

224
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:51,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">way that we just described for the first</font>

00:15:46,990 --> 00:16:00,490
pocket or the first three pocket for TCP

226
00:15:51,899 --> 00:16:05,620
connection setup now the balancer has to

227
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:10,360
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decision based on the VC</font>

229
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,699
such as a health state of each server

algorithm to choose the server but once

232
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:30,790
the server it decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether the packet</font>

sent the HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> request the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> law answer</font>

234
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:40,389
will have a easier time in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

235
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:42,639
deciding which server is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send a</font>

236
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:50,050
packet to because the information is

237
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:53,889
right there and when you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> are to do</font>

238
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:57,969
this https say you do some online

239
00:16:53,889 --> 00:17:00,519
shopping and is about to do the check

240
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:08,189
out to<font color="#CCCCCC"> fill in your credit card</font>

241
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:08,189
information then this will come in handy

242
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:19,470
if this vegetation header is before is

243
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:24,130
pressed before those encryption hello

244
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:26,799
then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no balancer can see are easily</font>

245
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:30,610
and know where to send a packet of

246
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:34,470
course in this case that SSR decryption

247
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:34,469
has kept down by the server itself

248
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:44,310
and if you do have that<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSR accelerator</font>

249
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:54,600
this destination<font color="#CCCCCC"> header Archer can be</font>

250
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:57,419
put behind the encryption header because

251
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,939
the pocket is going to be allowed it to

252
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:04,110
accelerator get the corporate and send

253
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:08,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to the load balancer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and in this</font>

254
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:15,320
case then that basic saturation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

255
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:15,320

<font color="#CCCCCC">canvassing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be raped by the load</font>

257
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:23,330
balancer and you can maintain your

00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,330
session persistence easily

259
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:37,810
so there are multiple ways that the ipv6

260
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:43,020
can help to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more robust session</font>

261
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:43,020
positions as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned earlier that</font>

262
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:53,560
war is formed by default turn off the

263
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:57,520
cookie so the hallway of using the

264
00:18:53,560 --> 00:19:06,970
cookie to do session persistence is not

265
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:11,650
likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk instantly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tray mosa wise</font>

267
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,900
traffic is repent when in fact some

translation of basic traffic into before

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:26,580
before you<font color="#CCCCCC"> leave their own network</font>

271
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:38,918
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to see if there's a</font>

272
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:42,639
possibility actually we can have the

<font color="#E5E5E5">traffic going through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lobe answer once</font>

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:56,799
old a it believes a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS von oben you</font>

277
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:06,779
and then you cash the informations so

278
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,809
it will be possible if we have such a

279
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:18,160
topology in the data centers the load

280
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:24,040
balancer is not in the direct path

281
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:27,650
between the crime and the civil forum

282
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,120
instead the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Frog way the traffic will go</font>

283
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:33,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> noble and say and then come back</font>

284
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,669
helping back to your distribution sewage

285
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,809
are there three distributions two

286
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:41,140
instances such as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nexus switch and</font>

287
00:20:37,809 --> 00:20:46,220
then come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the civil forum</font>

288
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:51,200
because the crime already had the

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:58,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">desponding service address it can</font>

290
00:20:51,200 --> 00:21:01,450
actually in the foreign transaction it

291
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:04,370
doesn't have to use a bleep address of

292
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:09,020
the server of the row balancer instead

293
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:11,178
you can use a v6 a series of the server

294
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:19,790
directory and there might be securely

295
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:24,250
concerned here here's a way it works as

296
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:31,690
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> the project traffic will be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sent</font>

297
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:31,690
through proxy and each the server

298
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:41,370
silver send the trophy back through<font color="#CCCCCC"> loeb</font>

299
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:46,830
answer back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the crime and now the</font>

300
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:49,100
crime know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the the spawning servers v6 a</font>

301
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,100
trace

302
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,730
the screen yes they'll be too far away

303
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,880
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> me I cannot see very well on the</font>

304
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:16,840
screen here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's back up a little</font>

305
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:20,820
bit so here's a pocket from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> crime to</font>

306
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:25,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> server and then the pocket returned</font>

307
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:25,050
from the server back to the crime

308
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:35,549
and at this point yes you've walked away

309
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:39,239
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah at this point the crime</font>

310
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:41,759
already know the server's address so you

311
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:47,629
can send the packet<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly to the</font>

312
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,629
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> by passing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no balancer and</font>

313
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:57,859
the packet will be sent back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

314
00:22:52,109 --> 00:23:02,519
crime without going through low balancer

315
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:07,139
so the requirement are to the crop crime

316
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:09,929
that web browser will be to cash that

317
00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:13,918
desponding service<font color="#CCCCCC"> vcx address and use</font>

318
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:18,449
it in subsequent packet sent out from

319
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:26,309
the crime to applications to application

320
00:23:18,449 --> 00:23:32,129
servers and in fact was a crime in the

321
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:37,469
server can decide whether he<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font>

322
00:23:32,129 --> 00:23:41,728
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Eva's are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> several dozen in sir is</font>

324
00:23:41,729 --> 00:23:49,859
options then the crime doesn't have that

325
00:23:46,379 --> 00:23:55,859
information it will continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

326
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:57,299
web address of the load balancer and the

327
00:23:55,859 --> 00:24:02,249
scenario would be pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that what</font>

328
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:09,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we described earlier and if the</font>

329
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:12,719
server send back that address then the

330
00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:15,049
crime has an option to go directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

331
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,049
the server

332
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,980
so the silver is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually can make</font>

333
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:28,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that decision to see whether he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

334
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:36,800
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now or that and this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

335
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:41,170
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I have today horsham looks like</font>

336
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:44,990
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question in the middle Mike</font>

337
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,700
good morning Matt<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTAC from yahoo so if</font>

338
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I understand correctly you're going to</font>

339
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,310
open the TCP socket using the VIP

340
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,770
address it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get forwarded to a</font>

341
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:58,940
real server the real server sends back

342
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:02,420
its own IP in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> LVS be header and then</font>

343
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:04,640
somehow that TP<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP socket is going to</font>

344
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:08,000
magically jump from the VIP address it

345
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:13,300
was bound to over to the real servers IP

346
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:15,770
address web<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser can do that right</font>

347
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,649
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably some stitching that you</font>

348
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:21,290
need to do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe this something</font>

349
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:24,140
possible you can still keep that TCP

350
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:27,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">section Clive or you actually issue our</font>

351
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,060
new TCP connections I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

352
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:31,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to issue the new TCP connection I</font>

353
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,020
don't think we have any magic TCP socket

354
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:41,120
jumping yet but it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice idea thank</font>

355
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:45,100
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thanks look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right oh one more</font>

jean-christophe from team camry

358
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,649
interesting idea it's a little

359
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:53,120
complicated for my taste but the one I

360
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,840
guess I'll say one nice thing about it

361
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,429
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> peers that trying to remove some</font>

362
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,199
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sharing from the network by</font>

363
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,210
moving it up in to a protocol layer

364
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:04,370
which may be nice but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one thing that</font>

365
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:07,640
seems to stick out for me not maybe

366
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:10,189
knowing enough about this is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

367
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,250
prevent against spoofing attacks in that

368
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,690
next header now<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok is that next header</font>

369
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,550
them is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be inspected by any</font>

370
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,440
of the routers maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the proxy</font>

371
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,090
server or maybe you do have to do it by

372
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,120
the proxy server and how does it going

373
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,830
to know what's fit spooked or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

374
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,330
security

375
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:33,039
it's not addressed here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do realize it</font>

376
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:34,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a possible pitfall but if you're</font>

377
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:38,250
interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> certain we can now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

378
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:44,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">together to see whether this something</font>

379
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:50,700
could be useful guide and in fact if you

380
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:58,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">are sending</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a packet to your application</font>

381
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:58,529
your IP v6 address should be good right

382
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:09,490
but of course as a general mention that

383
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:12,580
someone could prove the v6 other address

384
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:15,610
on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> every SPL</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and no one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

385
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:23,289
expecting it yeah that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we we</font>

386
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:26,158
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks very much</font>
