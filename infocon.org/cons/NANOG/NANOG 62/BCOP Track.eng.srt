three<font color="#CCCCCC"> quarters of you well fantastic so</font>

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,650
a little bit about what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCOP is</font>

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,060
about you know we recognized certainly

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,129
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the course of years in lots of</font>

9
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,650
different operational forums that people

10
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,030
give presentations or you can search the

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,160
web for things and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as you get</font>

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,710
information that information becomes

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,540
effectively stale right these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,040
that continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change and evolve and</font>

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,080
our practices get get better over time

16
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,970
there's no real place to get information

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,560
vetted so if you for example go you know

18
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google for how do I whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's the</font>

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,720
best way to do X you don't generally get

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,220
an understanding of the sources or how

21
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,620
it's been vetted by subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font>

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,660
experts or if it's still currently in

23
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,179
use as a best current operational

24
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,520
practice so a few years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we decided</font>

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,009
to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get the communities together</font>

26
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,990
and actually have a process<font color="#E5E5E5"> by which we</font>

27
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:15,270
can document best current operational

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,829
practices get them written by subject

29
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter experts and get them vetted by</font>

30
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:21,059
the community the idea behind bc LPS is

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,039
to keep them current so they're all

32
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,990
living documents anybody in the

33
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:27,359
community can participate either as a

34
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,009
subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter expert or someone who</font>

35
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:32,189
just wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something so you can</font>

36
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:34,469
appeal for information on a best<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">participate as an author or even just</font>

42
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:50,520
grown quite a bit over the years there's

getting things vetted and eventually

become ratified this is open to anybody

98
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,530
give an update on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS attacks and</font>

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way feel free to get up and come</font>

100
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:23,079
to Mike at any time this is supposed to

101
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:23,079
be an open dialogue<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright taller man</font>

102
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:32,290
anyway my name is Uriel Fuentes hi Keeks

103
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:40,030
we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DDoS attack or the slider</font>

104
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:44,130
occur here<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright I'm sharing this week</font>

105
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:46,599
up I with some of this means they're

106
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:49,080
they're kind of like different people

107
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,700
from different service providers and

108
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,380
there's I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the P</font>

109
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,500
another person actually in the under the

110
00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:00,010
contributions he's been like wanting to

111
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:02,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">help us but he was pretty easy actually</font>

112
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,580
fighting the dogs attacks and things

113
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,910
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he couldn't contribute</font>

114
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,740
tell so I decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put his name</font>

115
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,870
because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> still wants</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to contribute and</font>

116
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,310
you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea was this is a living</font>

117
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,740
document so anything that you can

118
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,230
provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the community so we can all</font>

119
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:19,120
grow and really learn that that was the

120
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,800
idea so I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give him credit for</font>

121
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">for at least trying to help us on that</font>

122
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,520
one oops what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start what is the</font>

123
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,340
purpose<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this really is really to</font>

124
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">cheer practices which are performed</font>

125
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">improving environments on what to do</font>

126
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,270
before actually you get attacked during

127
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the attack and after the attack so we</font>

128
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,590
decided<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually do it in a</font>

129
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,110
methodical way<font color="#E5E5E5"> if from grassroots</font>

130
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:45,909
actually just what do people do when

131
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,530
they get attacked we hear so much you

132
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,020
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> theories or can you buy these</font>

133
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">equipment call it harbours networks or</font>

134
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:54,909
you can buy these solid service from

135
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,470
Akamai or whatever you do but you don't

136
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">have control you feel like you don't</font>

137
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,280
have control and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer</font>

138
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,979
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy something right so the idea is</font>

139
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,169
here well let's just try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break it</font>

140
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,570
down into you know these components on a

141
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:09,099
timeline what what what is a good

142
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,010
practice to do before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get</font>

143
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:14,530
attacked so we we come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out with some</font>

144
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,539
sets of what you do there what to do

145
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:18,340
what during<font color="#CCCCCC"> the attack and the most</font>

146
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:21,580
controversial part probably what to do

147
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,289
after you feel like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> victim</font>

148
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,880
I gotta victimize somebody I gotta tell

149
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:31,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody you know let me call the police</font>

150
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:33,669
type of thing let's see check out the

151
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,650
draft that we have currently that's

152
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:42,159
where all the beat cops are there

153
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:45,159
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> D does be copies there as well yeah</font>

154
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,039
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> if for those of you cannot read it</font>

155
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:52,419
its beak up nanog dork I guess the red

156
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:55,690
he's not very good but chick go to that

157
00:06:52,419 --> 00:07:01,060
website pick up nanowerk you'll find it

158
00:06:55,690 --> 00:07:04,030
there it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> under</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts okay what do we</font>

159
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:07,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">need that I you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think pretty much</font>

160
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:10,659
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all know why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d-does attacks are</font>

161
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:13,930
increasingly getting more more intense

162
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,789
bigger today<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just heard that the</font>

163
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:17,380
biggest one was around a hundred kick I

164
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:19,570
thought the biggest one was really

165
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">around most of them are around 20 gigs</font>

166
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:24,400
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only last like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

167
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:27,130
I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know five minutes but they're</font>

168
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,419
getting way bigger than that well there

169
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go who gets another one 500k anyway</font>

170
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:37,599
uh yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going it's going big so the</font>

171
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea is how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with that you</font>

172
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,780
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some of the some of the</font>

173
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:42,280
cloud providers they're probably the

174
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,559
biggest victims and they're the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones who</font>

175
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,609
come to contribute the most so if any of

176
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,070
you know numbers that can help us that

177
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">would really contribute to these because</font>

178
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:57,010
they'll be great so but the idea again I

179
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:59,199
want to emphasize the bullet number

180
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,300
number two there is really practical

181
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,550
something that we're all cheering on how

182
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,979
we have done it whether we messed it up

183
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,690
that's fine tell us about it because we

184
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:09,669
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear about the mistake so others</font>

185
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,139
don't don't make the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so</font>

186
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:13,389
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about to get it only right but</font>

187
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,550
also trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see why didn't work right</font>

188
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:19,240
kind of like a collection of boats

189
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:21,190
modems that's what we want to do what to

190
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,370
do so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just give you a quick</font>

191
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,229
outline made some points here but give

192
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:27,820
you a quick up line or how we did we

193
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:29,380
divided this on the on the on the

194
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,969
timeline so this is some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font>

195
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,939
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to do prior that we came</font>

196
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:36,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">up with definitely fire all filters and</font>

197
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,029
acls or you know do your best friends

198
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:41,620
you you'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprising the intensity</font>

199
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,459
of most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those details attacks are</font>

200
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:48,160
still very simple tcp bays UDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> bays that</font>

201
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:49,390
type of thing like<font color="#CCCCCC"> intense so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

202
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,640
showing you how bad your

203
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:55,600
doing your<font color="#CCCCCC"> a/ca else probably in v6</font>

204
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:59,069
right so always pay attention to your

205
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,120
open recursion for internal dns mitigate

206
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,970
identify mitigate most of the open

207
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,650
relays consider the dolls mitigation

208
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,810
subscription services obviously we want

209
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,520
to be vendor agnostic we went on we

210
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,040
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to recommend dude you know by</font>

211
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,290
this or do that but definitely there's

212
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,890
some some of those guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have have</font>

213
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,569
products even some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ISPs out there</font>

214
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,810
they have they made all this<font color="#E5E5E5"> d does</font>

215
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,450
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole service product for them</font>

216
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:28,000
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know talk about cable and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wireless</font>

217
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,840
you know British Telecom all those guys

218
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">have these as a service I forgot to</font>

219
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:39,490
mention the big ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> PCP 30 ABC p84</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

220
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,990
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Lee RFC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2827 so we'll know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

221
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,340
that you know I cannot say that that

222
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:48,700
kind of falls within the firewall

223
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:50,490
filters<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2827 RFC's and yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bcp 30m 84</font>

224
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,890
is probably also<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the multihoming</font>

225
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,000
firewall filtering area so but just to

226
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:57,850
throw the numbers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all know and</font>

227
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">love what you do do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the attack</font>

228
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,760
well you basically just collect an info

229
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:05,380
at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the idea is there</font>

230
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,760
they'd last very<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're you know</font>

231
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fast they're getting even</font>

232
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,980
faster now so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

233
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,050
collect enough info at this point that

234
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:16,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can actually identify what the heck</font>

235
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:19,120
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> here right so you'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

236
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,000
correct it somehow you'll be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

237
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,950
like oh my service subscribers Adams you

238
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,050
know paying some money to that they can

239
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually help me out with this they'll</font>

240
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,479
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you collect information so</font>

241
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:34,440
hopefully you'll correct on fine tuned

242
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,970
filters and all the different medication

243
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,750
services that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to deal with</font>

244
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:42,910
this what else do we have here let's say

245
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:45,580
and what to do after the attack some of

246
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,319
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we obviously say just go</font>

247
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,810
and look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> your file filters and acls</font>

248
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:52,780
you may want to probably have<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of</font>

249
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,819
the answers if you don't then<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

250
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,370
try to identify well what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the open</font>

251
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,220
what was attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually that will be</font>

252
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">very useful obviously and some of the</font>

253
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,889
controversial point you probably if you

254
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,980
guys are in the net now

255
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:07,389
email and list you'll see some of the

256
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:09,220
some of the most controversial pieces

257
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,249
right should<font color="#CCCCCC"> I who should I call what</font>

258
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,019
should I tell the FBI guys collect

259
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:15,639
information in some sites<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a</font>

260
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:19,119
Denver office that actually gets

261
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,879
collects all this info some of ours

262
00:11:19,119 --> 00:11:24,819
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> also mention I see three they have</font>

263
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:25,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are interested in that info that it</font>

264
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,248
doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

265
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,488
anything about it they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

266
00:11:27,249 --> 00:11:32,259
probably collect it but that's something

267
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:34,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">that probably can that should be done as</font>

268
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:36,040
well and obviously if you can share it

269
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:38,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the community that definitely will</font>

270
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,868
<font color="#E5E5E5">help a lot of us and we'll stop some of</font>

271
00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:45,128
the bad guys on the mess in our war cry

272
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:47,019
some of the contact that I think we're

273
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:49,059
still missing and the pickup and we want

274
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:51,629
to do it so we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

275
00:11:49,059 --> 00:11:54,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">participation from all of you guys</font>

276
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:57,639
definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to be what are the</font>

277
00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:59,559
least effective or not effective methods

278
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,350
that you guys have used or that we've

279
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:04,238
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think that you know try to</font>

280
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,129
stow away that's at it does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> didn't</font>

281
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:09,069
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go down that path that's not good</font>

282
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:13,660
I heard a couple of ones they were very

283
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:15,878
much I guess you would call it equipment

284
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:19,389
vendor specific like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will call them</font>

285
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:21,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">bugs right but if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any that is</font>

286
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:24,519
will be worth collecting the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beak up</font>

287
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:26,769
they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great and if you found any</font>

288
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,720
legal or law enforcement agencies I

289
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:31,119
think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was even an email threat</font>

290
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,699
going on a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> days ago talking about</font>

291
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:36,999
some guy was already angry or how can we

292
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:39,758
stop these guys so they don't get they

293
00:12:36,999 --> 00:12:41,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't keep doing the spamming so nobody</font>

294
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:45,629
answered basically the answer the the

295
00:12:41,889 --> 00:12:48,699
result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the email thread is nothing</font>

296
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:50,619
what else do we have and if you there

297
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:52,599
was another<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion about doing that</font>

298
00:12:50,619 --> 00:12:57,069
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> B Cup start educating people a</font>

you were attacked how we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

317
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,930
improve the beat cop here if you're

interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> helping us so please get</font>

319
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:49,180
involved the one one thing that we like

to do with the team that we have with

321
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,469
this means that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing it's</font>

322
00:13:51,699 --> 00:13:55,540
all through email so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you know</font>

323
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:56,980
we don't need your<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

email<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the group and we kind of grow</font>

326
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:03,040
from there and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion my star</font>

327
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:05,500
corrections or documents and we start

328
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">working from there the idea is not to</font>

intrude into your timing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

cloud provider Brian digitalocean who's

336
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,180
like start finalizing this now but we're

<font color="#CCCCCC">really looking forward to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his input into</font>

these drafts or online at ethiopian org

344
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,699

345
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:03,819
main nano it's not nano at page you can

<font color="#E5E5E5">built lunch I'm strong on ebgp pc LP</font>

348
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:19,360
heyo so we've got the BGP configuration

349
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:23,530
be cap and um pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much the goal of</font>

350
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:27,790
this be cap is to just document bgp like

351
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:30,520
ebgp peering we all do it we all know

352
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:32,920
people who've done it we all did it for

353
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:36,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time at some point can you not</font>

354
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">hear me is that better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we all did</font>

355
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:41,080
bgp at some point<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the first time and</font>

356
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">i would bet probably everyone in this</font>

357
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:46,930
room had a scenario where things went

358
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:49,450
pear-shaped at some point because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

359
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:52,180
something that a quick search in google

360
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:57,760
now would reveal like oh yeah max prefix

361
00:15:52,180 --> 00:16:00,099
that's a good one so really um<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jana kind</font>

362
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,910
of hit this here the driver behind this

363
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,770
says we were going through to

364
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,089
identifying different things for you

365
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,189
know different appeals to actually start

366
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,170
like getting these things together there

367
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,540
was a there was a thread in there that

368
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,670
really highlighted this exact scenario

369
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:14,589
that like you know there's a multi-day

370
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,829
thread the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to turn up a new</font>

371
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:20,320
session it's not happening and really it

372
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,150
ended up coming down to a max prefix let

373
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,130
you know he didn't have it set or he

374
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,770
didn't have a wide enough and his

375
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:28,390
session would come up and drop come up

376
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:31,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> drop in yeah no one could figure it</font>

377
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:33,460
out is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it this is that max prefix very</font>

378
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,040
easy obvious stuff but if you don't know

379
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:41,920
it's there it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult so we started</font>

380
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,420
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cop and initially you know we</font>

381
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">used to have a when we did our first</font>

383
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,910
this was a bit more truncated but we've

384
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">been working on it so we've got some</font>

385
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,860
data in there we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a handful of</font>

386
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:58,719
folks who've been contributing and we

387
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,890
try to stay vendor agnostic as much as

388
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,200
possible when we get to the path

389
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,699
selection we figured it worth

390
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,530
highlighting that you know juniper and

391
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,040
cisco do have a couple different knobs

392
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:10,149
that that matter and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's some of</font>

393
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff that I'd be interested in</font>

394
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,209
hearing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from folks is how deep we want</font>

395
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,579
to go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't I've</font>

anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure if</font>

398
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,439
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we really want to</font>

399
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,120
drill into and say oh well and but these

400
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,650
guys when you turn this one on because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

401
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,129
mean ultimately how many different

<font color="#E5E5E5">device</font>

403

404
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,370
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could go and</font>

405
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,860
grab the RFC's you know kind of here

406
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,219
here's how it works hit the hit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy</font>

407
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:37,780
ones and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might do it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> universe's</font>

408
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,300
skilled big names they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be bad</font>

409
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:56,290
ones too to cover off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the off the bat</font>

410
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:59,350
there oh no that's that's the point of

411
00:17:56,290 --> 00:18:04,420
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> session no I'm so did everyone hear</font>

412
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:07,600
the question loosely so i guess the mics

413
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:09,040
question was a you is this going to be

414
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,159
is the function of this thing to really

415
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,440
hit the basis so that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime they</font>

416
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">can harry can show up and find this kind</font>

417
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,090
of canonical document that says this is

418
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">what the world does when they consider</font>

419
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:23,919
turning up appearing session and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

420
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,450
should we cover all the bases and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

421
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,250
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know i mean that that's really i</font>

422
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:28,660
think that's up to you know the authors

423
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,070
of this thing and those authors are

424
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:32,830
probably everyone in this room plus a

425
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:34,870
bunch of folks on the list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

426
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to see you know that's a scope</font>

427
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:40,000
question how deep do we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go how</font>

428
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,550
wide<font color="#E5E5E5"> cetera personal opinion juniper and</font>

429
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,210
cisco safest bet most folks emulated one

430
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:48,570
of the other or split the difference you

431
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,530
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for example francisco</font>

432
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,050
yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably worth knowing</font>

433
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:56,139
particularly you know if someone's

434
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:59,500
passing it but i mean you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

435
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,880
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it's out there so we've</font>

436
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,130
gone through we've identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> n fun</font>

437
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,960
things we definitely go into ibgp

438
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:08,260
because folks may very well be familiar

439
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,640
with ibgp and there's a shock to the

440
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,379
system when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go and find out that</font>

441
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,030
there's different things that matter

442
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:15,820
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get into the ebgp scenario or</font>

443
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:17,290
vice versa so it's good to make sure

444
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,300
that we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that kind of like</font>

445
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:21,580
the basic tiebreakers what changes

446
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:25,030
between the two but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the focus this thing</font>

447
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:26,590
really is ebgp configuration and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

448
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:29,290
basic peering so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not drilling into</font>

449
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,560
you know XP specific stuff or only

450
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:34,240
transit it's really these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the things</font>

451
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,919
so whether you're you're you and we

452
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,810
we've kind of abstracted the term

453
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,929
transit to not just be a transit like if

454
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,820
you

455
00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,639
a service provider and purchasing

456
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:45,189
transit from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tier one it's really</font>

457
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:46,629
getting a zeros route or greater from

458
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:48,940
someone else to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to the next</font>

459
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:51,549
place but that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's defined and</font>

460
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,440
that's how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> drill on from there and so</font>

461
00:19:51,549 --> 00:19:54,789
we get we've gone in and and as we get

462
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,289
deeper into this thing and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

463
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:58,600
the policy considerations this is really

464
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:01,899
where I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more feedback from</font>

465
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,240
the community because<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

466
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:05,439
everyone knows kind of like the general

467
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,649
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogan things that you probably</font>

468
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">ought to filter us where to maybe get</font>

469
00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:12,248
some of this data from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Neil what</font>

470
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,959
communities may be used by different

471
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:15,279
providers things like that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

472
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone's probably got a different spin</font>

473
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,759
on how you want to handle these things

474
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,739
and it'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice to get some</font>

475
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback from everyone to see what we</font>

476
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,240
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> boil down to still into like this is</font>

477
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:27,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is for sure the definitive ideal</font>

478
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,460
type of filtering we want to drop on the

479
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,840
edge there um and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also one of</font>

480
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,639
the things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's this is also covered</font>

481
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,590
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of Chris's documents there that's</font>

482
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:38,049
that's currently a draft the I think the

483
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,470
ipv6 appearing one has some of this data

484
00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:42,820
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really kind of the</font>

485
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,320
stewardship stuff so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the irr</font>

486
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,960
configurations things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that making</font>

487
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,418
sure you're you know updating your data

488
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,610
at getting our<font color="#CCCCCC"> psl going all out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

489
00:20:49,419 --> 00:20:53,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's fairly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vanilla and I think we've</font>

490
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,219
got that one covered but it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good to</font>

491
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">see if there's anything that we've</font>

492
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">missed and then the biggest one that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

493
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,320
really need more info on which is right

494
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,509
down here<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very very bottom</font>

495
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,009
testing and validation so we've got some

496
00:21:04,509 --> 00:21:07,509
stuff in there I've gone through and

497
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:11,169
grabbed a handful scenarios it's

498
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:12,879
definitely not complete and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd be</font>

499
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:14,830
interested to see what folks use as a

500
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:16,178
standard basis like when i turn on bgp

501
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:20,799
these are the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I validate</font>

502
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:22,179
once it's up and then also we've got a

503
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,220
handful of troubleshooting steps within

504
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:26,379
their typical scenarios that that happen

505
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,940
bgp establishment problems you know max

506
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:30,879
prefix was was one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

507
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:33,460
highlighted their EBT<font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop you know</font>

508
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:35,439
validation how many TTL is too many TTL

509
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,539
things like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know checking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

510
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,610
stuff out<font color="#CCCCCC"> l2 always validate that you</font>

511
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:41,379
have IP reach before you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn up</font>

512
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,549
up here it can be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustrating</font>

513
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:47,340
otherwise that kind of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> so here's</font>

514
00:21:45,549 --> 00:21:49,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">some of the participants right now I</font>

515
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:53,629
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I've only seen</font>

516
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">nina around today but uh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone's kind</font>

517
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:58,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of thrown some stuff in similar to our</font>

518
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,750
deal there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carsten dominant uh through</font>

519
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,880
his name<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there I think you through a</font>

520
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,280
couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> at us early on but you</font>

521
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,630
know he did his diligence he got his

522
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:19,940
word out there so here we got our thing

523
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:29,300
going yes that's disgusting well alright

524
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:34,360
cool okay well I mean that may not be a

525
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:36,350
bad one to actually hit maybe under yeah

526
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:39,919
that's kind of that in between land

527
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:42,139
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I and II thing where I like</font>

528
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,070
it no yeah okay that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be a bad</font>

529
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,200
one could throw in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to at least</font>

530
00:22:43,070 --> 00:23:03,139
like identify what it is and how come

531
00:22:45,200 --> 00:23:05,420
yes dad this is that's yucky i think

532
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,820
it's a it's more the answers I yes I

533
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,390
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really these practices are</font>

534
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:13,010
things that everyone ought to probably

535
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,870
do some of the stuff is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very specific to</font>

536
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,520
the provider space but some of its

537
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,500
definitely specific to you know the

538
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,600
consumer<font color="#CCCCCC"> the c/e side of the house</font>

539
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,420
because the problems are the same I mean

540
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,709
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I do it on gigantic routers</font>

541
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:26,570
and have to worry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> your multiple</font>

542
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,920
peers and transits plus customers

543
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:29,480
doesn't mean that the customers don't

544
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,430
have to deal with multiple appearing

545
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,530
partners and an additional external

546
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,820
peers it's the same problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font>

547
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,840
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when you get into</font>

548
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,100
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things like you know the</font>

549
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:40,310
filtering at the edge<font color="#CCCCCC"> and stuff like</font>

550
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:43,909
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought to have a bogan filter in</font>

551
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:46,639
your you can't trust your provider you

552
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,050
should be able to but you know it could

553
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,260
be a dude like me running that thing you

554
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:53,419
could be in a jam so making sure that

555
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,540
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that filtering into that I</font>

556
00:23:53,420 --> 00:24:00,350
don't want to accept 164 from you<font color="#CCCCCC"> isp</font>

557
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:02,600
that's marked as special so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

558
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:03,620
it the goal is really to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure we've</font>

559
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:09,439
covered

560
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:18,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">basis with his</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question Confederations</font>

561
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:18,700
you can see the scope right too far

562
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,920
right which you know and that is one of

563
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things that even putting the idea</font>

564
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">I even putting the ibgp stuff in there</font>

565
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,500
it was kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a question because like</font>

566
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,880
will we don't want to go down<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

567
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,640
rabbit hole because we really care about

568
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,350
ebgp specifically but it may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

569
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,570
bad thing to at least say this is what

570
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,760
it is and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why we're not talking</font>

571
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:41,990
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as and maybe I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

572
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,250
there's some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cautionary tale to</font>

573
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,720
get attached to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but there may be</font>

574
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:46,190
something we can talk about you and the

575
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,970
list there to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how we want to</font>

576
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">tackle that problem um those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

577
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:55,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks so right now we've got a draft</font>

578
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:58,659
posted there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple sections that</font>

579
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,660
probably need oh yes charlie

580
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,510
um you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't know if we cover I'm</font>

581
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to think we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a section in</font>

582
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">there that actually I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind</font>

583
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:18,140
of basic<font color="#CCCCCC"> interop stuff to make sure that</font>

584
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,490
like the external<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer can support</font>

585
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,370
particularly if you're the guy running

586
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,510
it running it but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it may not be</font>

587
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,709
a bad thing to have in there I'll off to

588
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">look back through the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doc and see if</font>

589
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,310
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there</font>

590
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:45,380
right frightened yeah so the goal really

591
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:46,850
is it's it's really ebgp and we've got I

592
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,190
in there simply doing kind of like just

593
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:50,480
pointed out point out what it is but

594
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah ebgp is really the thing because</font>

595
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the one where you have to play</font>

596
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,879
nice with people or hope that someone

597
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,230
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> to play nice with you but you know</font>

598
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,670
trust<font color="#E5E5E5"> but verify kind of stuff that's</font>

599
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:02,300
with a filtering all that stuff starts

600
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:06,410
coming in so current status draft is

601
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:09,530
posted there may be some rough patches

602
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,970
grammatically things like that I'm even

603
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:13,940
if you're not a BGP person but you

604
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:16,100
really like reading broken English and

605
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,080
difficult documents it be I'd appreciate

606
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> support for you know for just basic</font>

607
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,610
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> editing you know detecting nits</font>

608
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,139
putting commas in places things like

609
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:26,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's helpful because ultimately</font>

610
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:28,370
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> these documents need to be able</font>

611
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,200
to stand on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own and if you are</font>

612
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in BG peaches generally and</font>

613
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,350
you do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time that's really</font>

614
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful too because you probably have</font>

615
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:37,040
you know copy and paste templates things

616
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,300
that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done whatever it whatever it</font>

617
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">is you've done over your entire career</font>

618
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,149
there's probably some peace in their

619
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:44,210
particular when you get into the testing

620
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:49,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and validation that will help get this</font>

621
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:51,590
document to where we need it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be also</font>

622
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">Aaron's going to get deeper into this or</font>

623
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,070
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris's I don't know who's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

624
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,680
to talk about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a handful</font>

625
00:26:55,070 --> 00:27:00,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">of different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nogs out there that are</font>

00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,730
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards a common document you</font>

627
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,740
know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> all we're all doing a similar</font>

628
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,510
thing everyone kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of see is like</font>

629
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,120
peering is kind of a thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

630
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make the internet work so maybe</font>

631
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should write something down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and now</font>

632
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:13,129
that's been said not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> in English but</font>

633
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,010
Japanese polish and a couple other

634
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:18,860
different languages and also there was

635
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:21,740
an ietf effort a couple years<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

636
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,590
create a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp that kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> died on the</font>

637
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,150
vine but you know we've talked to those

638
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,550
guys and they're actually interested in

639
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">participating in this thing as well so</font>

640
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:31,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that doesn't mean we're definitely going</font>

641
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:33,380
ITF direction with it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we definitely</font>

642
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,180
have a handful of guys who've thought

643
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:36,170
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem previously and we're</font>

644
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,850
gonna start folding with some of their

645
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:42,290
documentation into this thing here

646
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:45,500
shortly I think potentially so you know

647
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,930
join<font color="#E5E5E5"> us like what your else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ella says I</font>

648
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,040
mean it's it's pretty flexible handful

649
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,380
the guys wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a sync up call</font>

650
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,970
we do that it's not required and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

651
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,260
just pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you know shooting males</font>

652
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:57,350
back and forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got a google group</font>

653
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:59,840
going so we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of do our stuff</font>

654
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:04,520
collaborate etc and that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all i got</font>

are some focus that we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to refocus</font>

664
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,060
on more on participants I and there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

665
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:43,850
a couple of items we want to add to the

666
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:45,230
PCO p so the primary<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference between</font>

667
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,300
a public peering exchange and the

668
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:50,420
typical transit provider relationship

669
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,919
would have is most likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2</font>

670
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:54,200
it's a large territory environment and

671
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,780
they are policies and procedures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

672
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,010
you would not allow our isp would not

673
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,260
allow you to do certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing for</font>

674
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">example the handling of the prefixes</font>

675
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:08,410
covering the exchange so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind</font>

676
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:08,409
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two main focus of the spiezio p</font>

677
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,750
one of the big question is how do we

678
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:16,760
handle the routes the prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> right how</font>

679
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,770
do we head over ties it different

680
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,700
approaches has different trade-offs<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

681
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:24,410
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe the trade of</font>

682
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:26,660
concisely and making combination of

683
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:31,520
what's the best things to do when you

684
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:33,230
are in certain situation and obviously

685
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,180
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of common practices that</font>

686
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,980
you borrow from the general epgp

687
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,780
configuration<font color="#CCCCCC"> side so there will be</font>

688
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:42,920
cross references and sharing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of contents</font>

689
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:47,060
there so here's I really here's where

690
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:51,050
I'd really need help so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:04,369
basically what i just said we don't

think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's well understood outside of</font>

760
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:08,029
the service provider community and I

761
00:33:05,809 --> 00:33:10,099
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> even within our community I see</font>

762
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:13,940
lots of eyes glaze over when I bring

763
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:18,349
this topic up so participants or<font color="#E5E5E5"> myself</font>

00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:20,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">wojtek Cosette from comcast jf who I</font>

he's a CTO somewhere and myself they are

both not here today so so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

768
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:34,518
current outline it did kind of I had

769
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:37,159
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to break these out and make a</font>

bunch of individual bc<font color="#CCCCCC"> op's but it kind</font>

771
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:41,059
of didn't work out that way a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

772
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:43,909
general stuff kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> got weeded in with</font>

773
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:47,029
the other topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm keeping his one</font>

774
00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:48,409
document for now but we cover the kind

775
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:50,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">of like what Mike was talking about we</font>

776
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:52,839
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of try to educate and bring</font>

777
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:54,979
people up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the level where they can</font>

778
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:58,519
understand why something is the best

779
00:33:54,979 --> 00:34:01,190
current operational practice so we go

780
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:05,119
through lfm or link level OEM service

781
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,829
layer and did not even attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> erps</font>

782
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:09,348
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

783
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:13,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">and no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one has volunteered to be a smiie</font>

784
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:18,130
so if you're an<font color="#E5E5E5"> erps guy come talk</font>

785
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:20,230
so most of this stuff is complete the

786
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:22,690
orientation the link level<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font>

787
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:25,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">will be changing too much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> service layer</font>

788
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,889
there's just so much to cover with the

789
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,920
service layer I'm not sure when to call

790
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:31,389
it done we did a lot of a lot of the

791
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:33,310
fault management the performance

792
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:36,730
management is definitely lacking we only

00:34:33,310 --> 00:34:37,929
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pdu types covered so</font>

794
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,520
if you have experience with the

00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:41,319
performance management and some of the

796
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,860
more exotic<font color="#CCCCCC"> PD use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would be great</font>

how are people actually doing this how

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,770
has it worked how is it not work and

840
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,600
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking a little bit wider scope</font>

841
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,430
it's not just ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> which beach p38 is</font>

842
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,790
basically targeted strictly at ISPs and

843
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:45,520
this bc o P is going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at both</font>

844
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:48,070
ISPs but also enterprises and I XPS and

845
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:50,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of gamut of how do you do anti</font>

846
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,730
spoofing protections on your network

847
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,370
regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of network it is</font>

848
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:56,440
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this one is one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

849
00:36:54,370 --> 00:36:58,450
really excites me because again going

850
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:00,160
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the d das right i mean there's</font>

853
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,820
service attack but if everyone were

854
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:08,560
stopping spooked addresses we'd see a

855
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,880
huge reduction in spam and an

856
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,320
all-service attacked<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean that it's</font>

857
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">really as simple as putting these</font>

858
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,160
filters and so so hopefully this<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

859
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,610
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> traction once we get it pushed out</font>

860
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,529
and definitely keep a look for it right

861
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:22,570

quickly here in in Africa there's a bc o

<font color="#E5E5E5">working within a snog mailing list right</font>

00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,940
now and in kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> early phases there's</font>

know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's on going to meetings is</font>

actually means they've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting for</font>

906
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,700
two years so it's fairly significant

907

then we meeting again I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

support from the internet society and

912
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:23,830
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kind of rolling there is one</font>

where they're gonna start publishing new

921
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,859
documents and one of the focus is there

922
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:47,530
the reason it's hyper localized is in

923
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:48,609
Japan they mostly speak Japanese unlike

924
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:49,869
a lot of other countries where a lot of

925
00:39:48,609 --> 00:39:51,940
engineering works gets done in English

926
00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:53,800
in Japan most of it gets done in

00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,129
main purposes of the bc o P task force

945
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:38,200
is to identify documents that should be

946
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:39,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">written kind of hand those ideas off to</font>

the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups I say the ipv6</font>

948
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:42,850
working group or the DNS working group

or whatever working group it falls under

950
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:47,560
within right so kind of just almost a

951
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,649
secretariat for these documents through

952
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:52,869

there right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on their</font>

963
00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:12,759
development process so how do we put

00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:14,440
together documents in that region and

965
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:16,380
obviously North America you're here

966
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,970
you've seen what we're up to right now

967
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,249
I'm going a little bit deeper<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

968
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,390
going to go too<font color="#CCCCCC"> far into this but one</font>

969
00:41:21,249 --> 00:41:24,598
thing I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mention is that in</font>

970
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:26,828
Africa right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually an</font>

00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:34,359
which is taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a local look at specific</font>

973
00:41:30,249 --> 00:41:37,029
things with I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe it's a ipv6</font>

974
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:38,410
deployment specific to Africa kind of

975
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:39,640
think there's some some strangeness

976
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:40,839
there with with some things<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font>

977
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,509
put together so they're already

ipv6 troubleshooting for help desks so

983
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:56,680
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a document where you</font>

984
00:41:54,759 --> 00:41:58,239
could hand it over to your you know

line or whoever's ones who actually

987
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:04,119
answers questions and they start have it

988
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:05,170
be a base template for where to start

989
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:06,579
right and then of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network</font>

990
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:09,099
you're gonna have your own little things

somebody's house or somebody's business

994
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,190
you know what are the things they should

995
00:42:14,019 --> 00:42:19,450
check to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure that why</font>

how do they actually write documents vet

them publish them go back and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

be simply efforts yet but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1009
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:48,400
something that's definitely spreading I

1010
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,720
think everywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> I go to talk about it</font>

1011
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,910
people are really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in really</font>

1012
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,609
excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the short falling is</font>

1016
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:00,549
people do and at least if you can commit

1017
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:02,380
a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time it makes a huge</font>

1018
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:03,549
difference as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see you know when</font>

1019
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,540
we get five<font color="#CCCCCC"> or six people writing a</font>

1020
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:07,220
document you know everybody

1021
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:09,890
paragraph or two really when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it comes</font>

things or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know add some links and it</font>

1024
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:18,230
doesn't become a huge workload typically

1025
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,880
speaking of that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a page up that</font>

1026
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:23,330
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna actually check out real quick</font>

1027

here maybe there we go so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

way<font color="#CCCCCC"> nana set up our development process</font>

1030
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:39,259
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there we go the process starts</font>

1031
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:40,910
with an appeal so anyone can say ask a

1032
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,090
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the best current</font>

1033
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:48,620
operational practice for this for

<font color="#CCCCCC">example traceroute our route server</font>

requirements / country that is relevant

1037
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,690
in the u.s. if you only know Indiana we

1038
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,220
don't really have to deal with us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

Canada but and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other places in</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">card hard to keep track of so these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1044
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,640
all appeals these are questions that we

00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:09,110
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> community has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asks that folks</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's not an answer we're saying that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no one is written it down in</font>

1049
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,640
this format some of these can be

1050
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,900
answered really quickly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

1051
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,640
did write<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere already and</font>

1052
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,190
all they really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you</font>

1053
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:22,970
know link it together pull it together

1054
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:24,320
some of them have been written<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:25,730
several times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need to need to</font>

figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the differences where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

current actual operational practice

1059
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">versus different versions for different</font>

1060
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:34,930
areas of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world or different</font>

1061
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,280
companies or go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the documents</font>

1062
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:38,990
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing I really want to point out</font>

1063
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">here is what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do have a committee</font>

1064
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:43,729
that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> chartered with pushing</font>

1065
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,560
this effort forward in North America

1066
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:47,210
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nanog region and keeping</font>

1067
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,890
everything moving and right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

1068
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,450
you saw presented a document in progress

1069
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,339
happens to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> member of the committee</font>

1070
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:53,839
that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we expect this to go</font>

1071
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,670
that doesn't scale right eight of us

1072
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,170
can't fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and write all these</font>

1073
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:58,940
documents within any kind of reasonable

1074
00:44:57,170 --> 00:45:01,010
time frame so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who</font>

1075
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:04,730
are excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about one of these topics or</font>

1076
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:07,190
their own topic to step up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font>

1077
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:13,240
several ways to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that we switch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

1078
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:16,000
to the slides here cool um

1079
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,379
which is you know so one thing is is is

1080
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,680
just asked the appeal right just<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to</font>

1081
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:23,619
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vco p @ not org mailing list and ask</font>

1082
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,450
your question<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if it's something you</font>

1083
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:27,040
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want already on that list a new</font>

1084
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:28,330
idea whatever it is you can volunteer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1085
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">shepherd and a shepherd doesn't</font>

1086
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,810
necessarily have to write anything the

1087
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:33,760
Shepherd's job is to go find subject

1088
00:45:31,810 --> 00:45:36,130
matter experts and be the whipping boy

1089
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,720
right send emails make phone calls and

1090
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:39,130
text messages find them in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> halls of</font>

1091
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,899
meetings and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the smees</font>

1092
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:43,090
are actually contributing and then maybe

1093
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:44,860
help edit it together you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

1094
00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:46,360
shepherd<font color="#CCCCCC"> and SME right or you can be</font>

1095
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,590
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or you're adding content</font>

1096
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:49,240
maybe something you've already written

1097
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:51,010
maybe of internal documents you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can cut</font>

1098
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,020
and paste parts from I mean a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1099
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">this isn't super hard because again the</font>

1100
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:56,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea is we're writing down best current</font>

1101
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,030
operational practices so none of it

1102
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,090
should really be new it should be stuff

1103
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:03,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know at least somebody knows</font>

1104
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:06,760
and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like to roll it over</font>

1105
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:13,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the open mic then we have any</font>

1106
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:19,290
comments<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions or ideas thoughts</font>

1107
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:19,290
yeah please absolutely

1108
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:29,460
yeah so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question was are we seeing</font>

1109
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:31,749
lots of similarities between the regions

1110
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:33,369
because again we probably don't want to

1111
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:35,919
see different bc<font color="#CCCCCC"> Opie's for Latin</font>

1112
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:38,319
America versus North America yeah I

1113
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,819
agree this is the internet and hopefully

1114
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,499
it works pretty much the same everywhere

1115
00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:42,849
on the planet otherwise we're doing

1116
00:46:41,499 --> 00:46:44,979
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong right I mean the whole</font>

1117
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:47,440
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> was interoperability and and a</font>

1118
00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:50,890
network of networks so yeah so there

1119
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:53,190
should be commonality right now so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1120
00:46:50,890 --> 00:46:55,930
roll back in history right the original

1121
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:58,359
idea was to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one bc o P effort</font>

1122
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:59,319
globally and that just<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't get in</font>

1123
00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:01,269
quite get off the ground it's really

1124
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:04,390
hard to pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> that off and so we stepped</font>

1125
00:47:01,269 --> 00:47:06,819
back and let efforts kind of spur up

1126
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:08,799
regionally which allows for working

1127
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:10,630
right so we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same language</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1128
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:12,670
the same time zone we're close to each

1129
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,920
other we come to some meetings so this

1130
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:16,960
group finds it easy to work together but

1131
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,609
I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the long-term question</font>

1132
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,589
there is how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this all tie together</font>

1133
00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:22,960
at the top we haven't gotten quite to

1134
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:24,578
that point yet there are a number of us

1135
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,690
watching what's happening and making

1136
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:27,460
sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is coordination between</font>

1137
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the groups right now eventually I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1138
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,489
there's gonna be some kind of leave

1139
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:31,869
there needs to be some kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of official</font>

1140
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:34,960
secretary at where we're vetting

1141
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:36,609
documents probably a you know a board<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1142
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,440
a counselor something similar to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NRO</font>

1143
00:47:36,609 --> 00:47:40,719
where representative from each region

1144
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,789
can vet the documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say yes you</font>

1145
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:46,380
know we all agree this is fine or than

1146
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:50,619
you know that this is not fine but best

1147
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:54,309
please hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris would feel with Twitter</font>

1148
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:56,259
I noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lot of documents are</font>

1149
00:47:54,309 --> 00:48:00,369
an hour are maintained in the wiki

1150
00:47:56,259 --> 00:48:01,719
format are they publicly editable just

1151
00:48:00,369 --> 00:48:03,219
just come one just register for an

1152
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:05,640
account and make updates to the draft

1153
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:08,589
documents or is that be handled by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1154
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:10,328
administrators um<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you have to get an</font>

1155
00:48:08,589 --> 00:48:11,890
account just for spam prevention right

1156
00:48:10,329 --> 00:48:13,539
now but really if you just email the

1157
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,249
list and say hey I want to contribute

1158
00:48:13,539 --> 00:48:16,450

1159
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:18,009
when it opened completely because

1160
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:21,819
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> wiki's when they're currently</font>

1161
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:23,650
open gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty fast also each document</font>

1162
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:25,119
is kind of worked on by the group that's

1163
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,920
working on it and so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are</font>

1164
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,809
either using like a google doc or a word

1165
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,969
doc they're emailing around or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>
