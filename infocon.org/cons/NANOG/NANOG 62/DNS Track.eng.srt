1
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright think we're gonna get started</font>

2
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:20,140
just in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you this is a room check</font>

3
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:22,600
this is the DNS track we've got three

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:26,890
talks on various things<font color="#E5E5E5"> relating to the</font>

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS and some of the ITF efforts some of</font>

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,830
the security issues that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,900
first up is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be Tim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Osinski he</font>

8
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,540
works at Salesforce and it's also the

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,019
co-chair at the ITF in the DNS op

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:43,330
working group and he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of</font>

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,089
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the initiatives that</font>

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:50,010
are going on right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now in the DNS op</font>

13
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:50,010
group relating to dns and privacy

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,829
yeah sure this resolution works

15
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:28,970
she doesn't show

16
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:54,039
no I don't see it that was the thing i

17
00:01:46,510 --> 00:02:02,590
didn't do this one worked in Toronto so

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:06,400
I feel confident we're in good shape or

19
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:09,180
else is technology it so well but we

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a total pedigree</font>

21
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:25,940
so now we're as I gentle I guess we're

22
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,350
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start right now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> failed</font>

23
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,350
to test the technology

24
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,090
power<font color="#E5E5E5"> cycle it sure</font>

25
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,500
yeah try try yours

26
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:21,660
there we go there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go you plugged it</font>

27
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,660
and plug it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

28
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:41,489
hey technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right good afternoon</font>

29
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,159
I'm Tim lesinski as<font color="#E5E5E5"> he said and I</font>

30
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:46,519
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you guys have go to ITF I</font>

31
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah we've probably talked in the past</font>

32
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:54,629
like I said I'd co-chair DNS operations

33
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,099
at IETF which has been which has a lot

34
00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:59,510
of various work going on but this is

35
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,339
more work on sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DNS privacy</font>

36
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,358
sort of sort of problem sort of the

37
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,319
problem space which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

38
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,030
definitely not operations and more of a

39
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,480
safe application type issue kind of

40
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:14,939
thing so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem here you</font>

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,738
know I in being networked people you've

42
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:18,510
all seen the TCP dump data you know

43
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,760
we're all used to sort of snooping at

44
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:22,199
people's traffic that's Warren's TCP

45
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,870
dump data so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go figure</font>

46
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:28,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">out what he's up to he was very willing</font>

47
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:32,010
to sort of share that so and then in the

48
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,659
big picture you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

49
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">user sitting in a hotel conference you</font>

50
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,320
know using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Wi-Fi or a coffee shop or</font>

51
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like that and there's no</font>

52
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:43,139
expectation of privacy with anything

53
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,638
especially your DNS queries the major

54
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,090
thing is they don't know what the what

55
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,240
sort of data they're leaking out there

56
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:53,549
people just aren't paying attention and

57
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,810
and so they easily can be sort of as you

58
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,909
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can sort of easily see</font>

59
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,740
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in some skate in some</font>

60
00:04:56,909 --> 00:05:03,060
sense and you know networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

61
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,530
compromised networks and servers

62
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,880
everything is compromised nowadays you

63
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,690
know you just it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a matter of if</font>

64
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,070
but when you can't assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

65
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:15,030
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up there is secure in any</font>

66
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:16,430
sort of level also<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the ITF they</font>

67
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:19,530
have sort of taken the<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach of</font>

68
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,030
pervasive monitoring is an attack they

69
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:24,448
view it as an attack vector much like

70
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:27,210
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> else and they're and they're</font>

71
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,770
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back and sort of focusing</font>

72
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,409
more on privacy in terms of in all the

73
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,909
protocols in light of you know I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

74
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:35,130
just recent revelations but just in

75
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:36,810
general they sort of taking a new closer

76
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:39,689
look at making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the things that</font>

77
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:41,610
exist out there the protocols that exist

78
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:44,509
have an ability to sort of give people

79
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,069
some sort of privacy what's going on and

80
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:48,329
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption right there's</font>

81
00:05:47,069 --> 00:05:50,339
a week I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the</font>

82
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,129
distinction privacy confidentiality

83
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:55,589
versus<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of encrypting</font>

84
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:58,139
encrypting the solution but if you look

85
00:05:55,589 --> 00:06:01,019
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the small picture dns queries</font>

86
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">leak metadata you know if your query is</font>

87
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:05,249
not cached your entire query has passed

88
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:09,469
all the way up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root for people to</font>

89
00:06:05,249 --> 00:06:11,610
sort of poke at and prod at and so and

90
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,019
what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying now is that's not</font>

91
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,939
very interesting you know people think

92
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:17,099
in a sort of simple view it's not very

93
00:06:14,939 --> 00:06:19,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting but that could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aggregated</font>

94
00:06:17,099 --> 00:06:20,789
by individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> or groups and computers</font>

95
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,219
are really good at aggregating that data

96
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:24,869
and if you a great enough data over time

97
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:29,969
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get an excellent view of what</font>

98
00:06:24,869 --> 00:06:33,989
users are doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and so that's</font>

99
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:35,308
something that you know is it is it's

100
00:06:33,989 --> 00:06:38,698
worrisome to some it may not be

101
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:40,379
worrisome to all but if you're looking

102
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:43,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">at sort of conventional security you're</font>

103
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:46,860
sort of typical service hardening does

104
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:49,050
it help yeah kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of write it it you</font>

105
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,519
sure take you take out the server you

106
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,589
know protecting your certain recursive

107
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,839
servers from being compromised you know

108
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:56,369
but those those servers you know people

109
00:06:54,839 --> 00:06:58,739
are using public dns servers all the

110
00:06:56,369 --> 00:07:00,629
time now the opendns<font color="#CCCCCC"> at Google you know</font>

111
00:06:58,739 --> 00:07:02,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">88 they probably do a large number of</font>

112
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:06,449
queries I know when talking with the

113
00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:08,459
opendns guys at ITF the number of sort

114
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:09,929
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the volume of queries that they sort</font>

115
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:12,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">of take on every day is sort of you know</font>

116
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:16,109
massive sort of thing and it's like a

117
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:21,389
next nice exponentially scaling graph so

118
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:22,829
there I think Warren had sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1% of</font>

119
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">the servers do ninety percent of the</font>

120
00:07:22,829 --> 00:07:27,149
queries is that the one percent of the

121
00:07:25,469 --> 00:07:29,729
recursive server that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there do like</font>

122
00:07:27,149 --> 00:07:31,229
ninety percent of the of the of the DNS

123
00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,808
queries on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so that's sort</font>

124
00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:35,248
of a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of people sort of have</font>

125
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:37,409
a large view into that data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

126
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:41,669
data is being mined right we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all know</font>

127
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:43,679
that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so even if you protect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

128
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,719
servers that data is still leaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

129
00:07:43,679 --> 00:07:47,039
you know and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not your fault right</font>

130
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:49,349
that's not anyone's fault because that's

131
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,419
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protocol is currently you</font>

132
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:52,800
know it's being implemented today you

133
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,529
know that the way the query names are

134
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,029
passed around

135
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:57,519
way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you when you can look at stuff</font>

136
00:07:55,029 --> 00:07:59,019
all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way up the stack those queries</font>

137
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,469
are being you know the whole query is

138
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:03,969
being sent out so when I looked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

139
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">people always say well DNS SEC should</font>

140
00:08:03,969 --> 00:08:07,479
solve this I'm just like no it doesn't

141
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:09,759
solve this you know Dean<font color="#CCCCCC"> SX signs owns</font>

142
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,769
and allows you to authenticate the DNS

143
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,989
data you have you know I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got this</font>

144
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:16,299
data it's valid you know it's correct

145
00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:18,938
you know it gives you some sense of data

146
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:20,318
integrity and it's good for really it

147
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:22,839
the best thing it does is preventing

148
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,089
man-in-the-middle attacks which are

149
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:27,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important the next thing is</font>

150
00:08:25,089 --> 00:08:30,819
everybody talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what about Dane</font>

151
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:32,438
you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Danes the DNS based</font>

152
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,449
authentication of named entities because

153
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:36,039
they when they see dns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they see</font>

154
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:38,378
certificates people say well that<font color="#E5E5E5"> solves</font>

155
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,779
all the problems and it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

156
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:43,779
it allows your certificates to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> bound</font>

157
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:46,149
to DNS names and it requires the NSA and

158
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:47,439
you can store those keys<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS but</font>

159
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:48,759
that only certifies that your

160
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:50,050
certificate is valid and that your

161
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,850
certificate authority has not been

162
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,439
compromised because<font color="#E5E5E5"> people actually</font>

163
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:56,079
started<font color="#E5E5E5"> to realize that well those can</font>

164
00:08:53,439 --> 00:09:00,279
be compromised too so Dane sort of

165
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:02,979
solves that problem so those solutions

166
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:04,329
authenticate the DNS data but your

167
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,279
queries are still you know there's still

168
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:07,870
query data floating out there that just

169
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:11,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of being out there in plain text</font>

170
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:14,860
and two ways to probably look at the

171
00:09:11,709 --> 00:09:16,809
problem is we can leak less data or we

172
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,550
can hide that data from malicious third

173
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:21,969
parties or attackers or whoever wants

174
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:23,769
that data sort of thing so you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

175
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,959
view it from from those two<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

176
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:28,329
solutions you know if we leak less data

177
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:30,550
one possibility is being discussed it's

178
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:32,349
sort of cute a minimization which is a

179
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:34,120
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actually not actually sending</font>

180
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,990
the entire query string up the resolver

181
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,250
chain we're still unclear if that's

182
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to actually how much that's going</font>

183
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:44,019
to help it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think in</font>

184
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:46,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS op we're actually going to start</font>

185
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">digging into very heavily there's a RFC</font>

186
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,349
on it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it was NSD had</font>

187
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,899
actually the<font color="#CCCCCC"> NSD name server I'd</font>

188
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:58,990
actually started looking at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

189
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:00,629
maybe maybe the unbound version but it's

190
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,160
still unclear like even if you do that

191
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,199
where the winds right does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

192
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:06,219
help so I think we're going to people

193
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:07,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">are going to try that and we're going to</font>

194
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,279
see where that

195
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,440
she helps<font color="#E5E5E5"> us or not then you sort of say</font>

196
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,360
well we can encrypt more stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

197
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't its dns right you can't</font>

198
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,410
encrypt a lot of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's an</font>

199
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:20,050
underlying infrastructure to you can't

200
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:23,260
we can't alter that without causing

201
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,439
major pain everywhere you know that

202
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:29,140
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just too many moving parts so</font>

203
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,960
we're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> HTTP to</font>

204
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:34,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">HTTPS problem right back in the mid-90s</font>

205
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:37,990
they had to put security on there it was

206
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of ugly but it you know it worked</font>

207
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,029
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time being and you know 20</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font>

208
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">later they're spinning the protocol</font>

209
00:10:43,029 --> 00:10:46,750
again right so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking them 20 years</font>

210
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,360
to go from one point 0 to two point oh

211
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's it's not it's not a</font>

212
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:56,830
trivial problem and we're in sort of the

213
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,140
doing this research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of looking</font>

214
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,370
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem space we're looking at</font>

215
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,439
focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the communication between</font>

216
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,640
the stub client and recursive resolver

217
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,110
right the stub client could be something

218
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're running on your machine DNS mask</font>

219
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,250
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can be running you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know any</font>

220
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:11,140
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those sort of things that's closest</font>

221
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,520
the end user it's also the most visible

222
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,500
right so it's the most obvious what's

223
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,779
going on there and it gives you a

224
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,000
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> block gives us a building block</font>

225
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:22,600
to sort of leverage continuing you know

226
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,130
we looked at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about oh</font>

227
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,959
we want to encrypt everything back to

228
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,890
the authoritative servers you know we

229
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:28,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">started looking at all this sort of</font>

230
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:31,660
problem space and it's a massive problem

231
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">space right so to just say you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

232
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:36,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sort of tackle all of it it's just</font>

233
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:38,050
it's just crazy so it's just you know we

234
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,810
figure we can build blocks of it and

235
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,550
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know that the what came up</font>

236
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:43,540
in the talks was it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Turtles all</font>

237
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:45,339
the way down right you just keep

238
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,740
stacking those blocks up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eventually</font>

239
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:48,790
you may get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the root servers but we</font>

240
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,000
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the root</font>

241
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:56,230
servers because there's all that other

242
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,580
political stuff about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so worn and</font>

243
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:59,230
myself sat down and wrote a charter

244
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,600
statement for what they're calling

245
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:03,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dean's private exchange that's for a new</font>

246
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,770
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group that we're looking to have</font>

247
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,670

248
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,160
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to have something going</font>

249
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:12,579
on for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> next one in November in</font>

250
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:14,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Honolulu we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to address these</font>

251
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:19,630
issues without overreaching the problem

252
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:20,950
space and so one of myself are starting

253
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:22,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">off as co-chairs</font>

254
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,850
and we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at developing</font>

255
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,010
deployable solutions we want something

256
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:29,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we think will work right because</font>

257
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,930
you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font>

258
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:35,110
go down rabbit holes and we can you know

259
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">I I've been tracking the HTTP to point</font>

00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:46,890
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a working group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

266
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:57,130
identifying a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> places where</font>

267
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,689
the where information can be leaked and

268
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,310
things can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be compromised and we're</font>

269
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:03,190
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in sort of the basis of where</font>

270
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,900
we're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> focusing on encrypting</font>

271
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,660
the conversations being cleaned client

272
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:10,350
and recursive resolvers and currently

273
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,760
there's actually two different proposals

274
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,950
one is the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the folks</font>

275
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,500
in various honor to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about next it's</font>

276
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,120
the start TLS for<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS they're flipping a</font>

277
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,060
bit they're flipping one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS to</font>

278
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,750
UM option bits to actually start a TLS

279
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:30,579
conversation in your DNS query<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

280
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:34,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> right it's okay okay it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like yeah</font>

281
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,790
so so that's and and that their stuff is

282
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">very interesting actually it's I find it</font>

283
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:41,380
very it's very very interesting what's

284
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:42,400
going on there and the second one is one

285
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">that people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of throwing around</font>

286
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:48,660
by saying let's just put TLS on port 443

287
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:51,820
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just run DNS on top of that and</font>

288
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,400
if it's a OPN you can do it with running

289
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:56,410
HTTP at the same time and there's and it

290
00:13:54,400 --> 00:14:00,280
that seems just like that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

291
00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:02,980
just very strange in its own way but we

292
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,720
all know that port 443 can get through

293
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:05,860
pretty much all the firewalls that's

294
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,870
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem when you're looking at</font>

295
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,270
stuff like this you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you</font>

296
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:12,130
can't spin the protocol and open up a

297
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:13,750
new port because every middleware box in

298
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world is just going to break so you</font>

299
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,260
have to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to</font>

300
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:19,930
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and people keep going back</font>

301
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:22,750
to that https thing of saying that seems

302
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:24,459
so it's so enticing i think is the way

303
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,070
they view it it's so easy we can just do

304
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:30,010
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> on port 443 and run TLS on it</font>

305
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:33,370
everything's gonna be good but what I'm

306
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:34,750
avid avidly not trying to work on in the

307
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,280
working group is

308
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,230
we're not trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns to point out i</font>

309
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,589
mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just seems that just madness</font>

310
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:44,170
and that's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's a task of you</font>

311
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:49,510
know that there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can come from</font>

312
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:51,069
that so it so we're focusing on like the

313
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:53,410
integrity and the confidentiality of the

314
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dean has mechanisms not trying to get</font>

315
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:56,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">into all the encryption stuff though</font>

316
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,709
there will be some in there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

317
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:00,700
not the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the focus we don't want</font>

318
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,260
to build some technically perfect

319
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,180
solution that's going to take us you

320
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:06,630
know decades<font color="#E5E5E5"> and employee you know look</font>

321
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,250
I mean the install base in itself

322
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:10,600
between you know just not between just

323
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:13,150
servers themselves but the middleware

324
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,210
boxes and all just stuff out there that

325
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:19,750
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passed UDP 53 and</font>

326
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:23,200
TCP 53 you know it to touch all that is

327
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:24,400
a monumental sort of thing but since

328
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a new working group I think</font>

329
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,280
we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> need so you know we're</font>

330
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,550
definitely looking for volunteers people

331
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to help engage with the IETF process</font>

332
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:34,839
we're discussions doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> going under way</font>

333
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,480
there's been a DNS privacy mailing list

334
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,530
where a lot of the stuffs been going on

335
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,610
probably for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months we've</font>

336
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:44,260
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a we had a initial session in back</font>

337
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,670
in February I think we're a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

338
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,819
stuff we're starting to flesh out and we

339
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:50,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">were able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to separate the what I call</font>

340
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,390
like the TLS encryption stuff from just

341
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,910
the real you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know let's figure out how</font>

342
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:58,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sort of clean up what's going on</font>

343
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">inside DNS right now what we have a</font>

344
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,609
session plan for Honolulu it's a bird's

345
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:04,989
it's a buff it'll play actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> sale</font>

346
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:08,200
tell us they figure it's gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

347
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:09,940
working group by then and I'm very

348
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,250
surprised because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there we wrote some</font>

349
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,260
charter text it made sense it you know

350
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:16,150
we tried we sort of said we're not going

351
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do certain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and so far</font>

352
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,589
everybody's like yeah that's good we're

353
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,210
not gonna do too much that's good you

354
00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:25,660
know that's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go ahead and do</font>

355
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,070
this but we will always need operator

356
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,959
and vendor participation of course right

357
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,089
we you know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of gather</font>

358
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,530
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you know especially with</font>

359
00:16:31,089 --> 00:16:34,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> queue name minimization thing or</font>

360
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:36,430
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that or tails what's</font>

361
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:38,770
going to break we start turning stuff on

362
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,229
right we start tweaking with this stuff

363
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,880
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> edge cases you know</font>

364
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:45,610
where is that the law<font color="#CCCCCC"> of unintended</font>

365
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,630
consequences you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know chases me every</font>

366
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,760
day so that's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm</font>

367
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:52,560
Oh easily you know and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that some</font>

368
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors have already started</font>

369
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,739
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this stuff and so it</font>

370
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,880
we good you know good to sort of start

371
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:04,050
boiling that's that sort of information

372
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:06,060
but that's kind of what we've been and I

373
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,819
know the verisign stuff is really about

374
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:11,669
it's going to dig more into their TD and

375
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,010
s thing but any you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I know we have</font>

376
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,800
time because Paul said somebody had

377
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:20,449
bailed so if there's any<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of house</font>

378
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:20,448
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions out there I</font>

379
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:27,000
jean-christophe from<font color="#E5E5E5"> team camry um I</font>

380
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,890
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up before this</font>

381
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,330
question but I hope you don't if you'll

382
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,830
just allow me<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask it again here and</font>

383
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,659
you could address it so I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

384
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:35,879
real reluctance to embrace dan bernstein

385
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:40,320
in the ITF and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the feeling is</font>

386
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,180
probably mutual what what's the you mean

387
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,919
with Rosie yeah what's the reason for

388
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,330
excluding curves I know there's there's

389
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,190
actually no reason for excluding curves

390
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,480
and actually curves has been like part

391
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,310
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the big discussion we first started</font>

392
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,140
having the encryption discussion and I

393
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:57,270
think you know I think nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

394
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,800
not a solid feeling like there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

395
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,870
solid base of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually using</font>

396
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dina's curve in a way to actually see</font>

397
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,159
can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you know what's the data look</font>

398
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,600
like right is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually work how is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

399
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,820
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how is it helping sort of thing</font>

400
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so and if opendns people here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

401
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,060
interesting just to hear their take on

402
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,410
it yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm actually if I can jump in</font>

403
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,320
as well as I don't think it's quite

404
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,210
universal that folks the IETF dismissed

405
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,639
the curve there is some misunderstanding

406
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:22,380
on some parts of what part of the whole

407
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,080
transaction it secures<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think some</font>

408
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:27,510
education on DNS curve salts a part of

409
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,679
the problem very well DNS SEC solves a

410
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:32,160
different part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem very well</font>

411
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,870
we actually as engineers usually sort of

412
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,220
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem figure out all</font>

413
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,080
the tools we have and figure out which

414
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,450
combination sucks least and I think that

415
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,330
curve is going to be part of that yeah

416
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I I personally as sort of DNS I've</font>

417
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,350
co-chair for the passengers who I don't

418
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,820
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of bias I know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

419
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,010
know it quite well I know everything

420
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:51,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on there but I don't sort of have</font>

421
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:54,090
that reluctance to sort of embrace

422
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:55,500
something like that right and actually

423
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,060
we've been looking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> folks that have</font>

424
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,080
actually been using the dns curve stuff

425
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,389
and seeing if we can get some

426
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,389
operational feedback from them so

427
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:11,509
yep ah yes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Warren said dan bernstein</font>

428
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:15,009
should have recently add one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the ITF</font>

429
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:17,960
sand I know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lot of acrimony</font>

430
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:20,690
prob about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years ago or so about a</font>

431
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:26,419
lot of that no I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's I think</font>

432
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:29,570
those that is faded with time so other

433
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:34,519
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> so pretty quiet so I know most</font>

434
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:36,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the usual suspects right so but the the</font>

435
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:38,720
folks in verisign are here and there's

436
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:44,509
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> on TLS I think that it is that</font>

437
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:46,070
what you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> TGS yep I find this</font>

438
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:48,620
stuff very fascinating and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

439
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:51,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's yeah so it so Glenn Wiley of</font>

440
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,080
verisign so what you're thinking of Tim

441
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:55,580
the TD<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s work is part of a stub</font>

442
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,289
resolver initiatives that verisign is

443
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:01,100
working on what eric and i'll talk about

444
00:19:57,289 --> 00:20:03,259
is kind of fundamental to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it</font>

445
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,178
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> precede that but but one of the</font>

446
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:07,429
things I've encouraged some discussion

447
00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:09,830
about you know when you when you think

448
00:20:07,429 --> 00:20:11,120
of DNS most of us especially in our when

449
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,129
we put on our operators hat we're

450
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,840
thinking about UDP yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what that</font>

451
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,928
looks like on our platforms and networks

452
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,279
and UDP and there's some obvious

453
00:20:17,929 --> 00:20:22,429
implications when you start talking

454
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:25,879
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving to TLS and what does that</font>

455
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:27,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">do to a typical DNS session and it is an</font>

456
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:30,110
operator it's very interesting to me

457
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they look nothing alike when I</font>

458
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,258
make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> transition that's right and a</font>

459
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,210
lot of that false starts to fall back

460
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:36,950
towards TCP and that makes people

461
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:40,190
concerned because there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

462
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">information right and i know inside DNS</font>

463
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,860
Appa they're actually been some very

464
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,929
interesting work going on with doing

465
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,879
like TCP keep alives<font color="#CCCCCC"> Indiana sessions</font>

466
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:49,490
Paul waters from Red Hat has done some

467
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:51,080
great really work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns keeping lives</font>

468
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,580
and chaining queries together so for

469
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">like DNS SEC where you actually have to</font>

470
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:56,480
do multiple queries in a row he's got

471
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,949
something where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can set the session</font>

472
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,980
up and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep that DNS query</font>

473
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,299
session open as a TCP session make

474
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,100
multiple queries against a server and

475
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:05,600
then shut it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're done you</font>

476
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,549
know like much like a regular like web

477
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,580
you know HTTP sort of like a very

478
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:11,210
regular you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

479
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,129
thing

480
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:15,289
so but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's not you know</font>

481
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:17,390
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say EVPs great because</font>

482
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:18,799
there's you know there it's like one

483
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,210
list of handshakes you know you don't

484
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">have that Cenac thing everything's right</font>

485
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,130
you know so I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

486
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:27,080
you know if you track the HTT to point o

487
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,490
stuff right the speedy work that they're

488
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,740
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get rid of those syntax</font>

489
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:32,240
and then you know to get more like UDP

490
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:35,029
and then DNS is actually starting to

491
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,200
slide towards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP land because they</font>

492
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:38,960
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that extra sort of state</font>

493
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:42,890
information or that sort of session that

494
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:46,100
is true yeah so I you know in past life

495
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:49,039
running<font color="#CCCCCC"> very busy TLD authoritative</font>

496
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:51,740
servers the the thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP my</font>

497
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,000
initial reaction is kind of panic I mean

498
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:55,100
you know I look at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think about</font>

499
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,039
what that does is the platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> but but I</font>

500
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,428
think any any transition any large-scale

501
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:03,169
transitions and Internet infrastructure

502
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:04,760
that's a pretty normal response to these

503
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:06,409
kind of transitions and we just need to

504
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,149
lead them with conversation and figure

505
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:09,200
out what's coming I think you study the

506
00:22:08,149 --> 00:22:10,969
data right you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the data and</font>

507
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,740
figure out how things perform and then

508
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:14,779
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> where can you make you know</font>

509
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:17,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">improvements in that let's go so and</font>

510
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:19,760
yeah I apologize<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been your your</font>

511
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:21,529
boss has been sort of hammering on me

512
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,539
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the TLS stuff which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is why I think</font>

513
00:22:21,529 --> 00:22:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when i have it on the my brain</font>

514
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:27,190
sort of thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe it yes so i</font>

515
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,190
co-chair with<font color="#E5E5E5"> tim one of the other</font>

516
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,440
things to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind about scaling is</font>

517
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,840
we're mainly discussing this for

518
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,390
recursive service so stub to recursive

519
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,580
and recursos have very different scaling

520
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:48,320
properties like they don't get separate

521
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,000
really short connections from a lot of

522
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,740
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> people they get separate</font>

523
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,470
longer connections from a lot of

524
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:56,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">different people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the scaling is not</font>

525
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:01,929
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scary as you know trying to do</font>

526
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:01,929
this cool calm or large TLD<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

527
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:11,899
other questions ok so next up we have

528
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Glen wiley and erik oster alfre</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bear</font>

529
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,990
sign and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking</font>

530
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:23,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some of the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

531
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:27,370
doing with DNS SEC and Dame obviously he

532
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,370
was more like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did a good one too</font>

533
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:52,730
good so I'm I'm Glenn<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wiley I've been I</font>

534
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:54,500
spent about seven years as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lead</font>

535
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:58,340
architect systems architect at verisign

536
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,990
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ComNet name servers and recently</font>

537
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,110
I've moved into an innovation group

538
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:05,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">within</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verisign kind of a so i could</font>

539
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,889
think tank an incubator of ideas things

540
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,720
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change that the company but</font>

541
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:11,330
it had big companies that can be hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

542
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,190
do so we created a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small group that we</font>

543
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,990
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in it has fewer of the</font>

544
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,720
encumbrances that come with large

545
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:21,980
organizations and Eric's going to be

546
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,960
speaking with me too he's seated because

547
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:29,299
he was over-enthusiastic last night

548
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:34,639
right so is it did you need a White

549
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:36,500
Russian what was the Eric's Eric's a

550
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:41,120
principal scientist<font color="#E5E5E5"> verisign</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in verisign</font>

551
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:43,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">labs and did you want me to make a</font>

552
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,070
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the hell oh I love it I</font>

553
00:24:43,669 --> 00:24:53,419
have top secret information on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sides</font>

554
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:55,428
here yeah yeah so DNS SEC so we you

555
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:58,610
think of a global distributed database

556
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:01,149
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns but in a sec is simply</font>

557
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:04,309
authenticated we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

558
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:06,018
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns sac and dane to try and drive some</font>

559
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,789
awareness here for folks that don't know

560
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:10,309
if you're already a DNS SEC expert and

561
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:11,720
you're running sign zones then you can

562
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:15,049
contribute<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the conversation but this</font>

563
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,360
won't be informative to you you know

564
00:25:15,049 --> 00:25:19,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's originally about protecting against</font>

565
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,939
cache poisoning man-in-the-middle

566
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:26,450
attacks against dns and and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think DNS</font>

567
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,570
SEC solves that problem very<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you</font>

568
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,669
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> argue prior to that there one</font>

569
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:34,939
really any security to<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak of at least</font>

570
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:36,860
on the resolution side for dns but we

571
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,149
can take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot further and we'd</font>

572
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:41,899
like to talk about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

573
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:44,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do with deanna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sac RFC 3833</font>

574
00:25:41,899 --> 00:25:46,668
enumerated some of the attacks against

575
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:48,559
dns everybody knows what they look like

576
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:50,929
they know what you can do with these

577
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but but one way to think about it</font>

578
00:25:50,929 --> 00:25:54,830
is if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I posed a question some</font>

579
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:57,428
meaningful question to somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

580
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:57,428
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience</font>

581
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,940
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> schumann something specific and then</font>

582
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,710
Warren decides to give me an answer what

583
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,320
why should I trust Warren if I don't

584
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">know him but but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the</font>

585
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,809
problem you have with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS should I trust</font>

586
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,929
Warren if I know him I don't ever first

587
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:17,250
one but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look at the</font>

588
00:26:15,929 --> 00:26:19,260
Annette's that's really what's happening

589
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,820
you're throwing a question out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and</font>

590
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:22,950
you get an answer back that you hope is

591
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,600
from the person that you asked but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

592
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:26,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">really don't have any guarantee that</font>

593
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,260
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what you're going to get</font>

594
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:30,210
so we've done things over the years to

595
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">try and tune this up a little bit but</font>

596
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:37,320
DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> sack is a provides a positive</font>

597
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:39,210
solution to that question in DNS SEC

598
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,340
finally has a killer app so you think of

599
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:43,490
infrastructure security that's that can

600
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:46,230
be hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell when you talk about</font>

601
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:48,000
armoring channels or creating security

602
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:51,120
behind the scenes that people can't see

603
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,830
any evidence of on their desktop it can

604
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,469
be hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell folks to spend money and</font>

605
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:57,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">time to implement it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane is that thing</font>

606
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that brings DNS SEC to the point where</font>

607
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:00,990
folks actually have a reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font>

608
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,630
they see that they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reason to use</font>

609
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,240
it rather um it lets them see

610
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:08,669
manifestations in applications Eric's

611
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,740
going to talk about security<font color="#CCCCCC"> email TLS</font>

612
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:12,690
there are lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ways you can actually</font>

613
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,130
leverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gina sec</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do something even</font>

614
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,480
more interesting than just guaranteeing

615
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:17,270
that you've got an answer from the

616
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:19,559
person you thought you're talking to

617
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:23,429
it's exciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me because it's</font>

618
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:26,639
actually operational we've seen adoption

619
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:29,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">is slow in in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> com I think we're at</font>

620
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:34,020
between 300 and 400 thousand zones out

621
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:36,059
of our 110 million zones under calm so

622
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:39,570
that that's that's a low adoption rate

623
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:41,490
but it's moving forward in 2013 I saw

624
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:45,149
one study that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that eight percent</font>

625
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:48,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the queries were validating August of</font>

626
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,520
2014<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve percent of the queries in</font>

627
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,919
North America are validating so that

628
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a nice the curve is looking</font>

629
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:56,700
better it's moving for the point though

630
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:58,530
is it's real it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there</font>

631
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:02,220
it's on the networks and people are

632
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:04,440
using it it's not hypothetical now

633
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,150
hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> this this isn't going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

634
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to anybody in here but but</font>

635
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:10,799
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take one slide just to refresh</font>

636
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">your memory about how DNS works and that</font>

637
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,309
is you

638
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:16,559
it's it's hierarchical<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority is</font>

639
00:28:14,309 --> 00:28:18,960
distributed down this hierarchy starts

640
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:22,590
with root server the dot and then moves

641
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,020
to a TLD say<font color="#CCCCCC"> com to a third level domain</font>

642
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,970
and you can have it<font color="#CCCCCC"> er ative queries so</font>

643
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:30,690
the idea if i want to find example.com

644
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:32,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to ask the route to find me a</font>

645
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,409
calm name server and then I'll ask the

646
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:36,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">calm name server to find me an example</font>

647
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:38,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm name server and then I might ask</font>

648
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,230
example.com to give me a hostname if

649
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:42,379
that's what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

650
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,610
idea is that i iterate over that tree

651
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,289
iterative<font color="#E5E5E5"> name service recursive name</font>

652
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:48,990
servers can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for me so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can just</font>

653
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:51,658
ask a recursive name server given me a

654
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:53,370
host IP address for example.com and it

655
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,659
goes off and does all that work<font color="#E5E5E5"> or I</font>

656
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:59,789
could do that locally on<font color="#CCCCCC"> my on my</font>

657
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:02,750
resolver on my local machine so so when

658
00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:06,059
you look at how DNS SEC changes this I

659
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,559
point out a couple of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is by</font>

660
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:10,129
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> standards our first attempt to</font>

661
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:13,710
deploy an<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet scale cryptosystem</font>

662
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:16,130
the DNS SEC zones employ public and

663
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:18,270
private keys which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something if</font>

664
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:19,770
asymmetric cryptography doesn't work we

665
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:24,059
have a lot of more serious problems than

666
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:26,279
DNS we we sign all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pieces of the</font>

667
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:27,809
zone and then the resolvers are

668
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:30,690
configured to take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this so</font>

669
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:32,340
you start off with a root key a trust

670
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,429
anchor that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would get from I Anna</font>

671
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:38,600
and as you issue queries you'll see

672
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:41,970
you'll go get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next key from root and</font>

673
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,610
then from calm and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go down</font>

674
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,809
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your your final destination and as</font>

675
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:47,399
you accumulate these<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys you're</font>

676
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:49,649
building a chain of trust three

677
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:51,330
signatures that lets you know for a fact

678
00:29:49,649 --> 00:29:55,320
that where you finally ended up is

679
00:29:51,330 --> 00:30:00,029
legitimate Eric you want to take this

680
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,740
bit so so yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of this</font>

681
00:30:00,029 --> 00:30:03,929
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> far has been made to sort of just you</font>

682
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:05,250
know reboot strap all of us on on you

683
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,529
know to sort of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim was pointing</font>

684
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,270
out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly is DNS SEC trying to do</font>

685
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:11,940
so that you know the negative like what

686
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,649
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not trying to do so you know at a</font>

687
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">really simple view of so after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

688
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:16,229
illustration that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Glenn just showed you</font>

689
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,330
know you see sort of climbing through a

690
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,190
hierarchy and pulling a key back but you

691
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:21,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">know at the low level what that what</font>

692
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,750
that might look like is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> following so</font>

693
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:26,880
you know here's a here's an example of

694
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:28,290
you know an NS set for some random<font color="#E5E5E5"> zone</font>

695
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,110
that we're familiar with at least where

696
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:33,840
we sit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dina sec I'll take a crypto</font>

697
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:36,389
key and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> crypto key plus that NS set</font>

698
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">will just annotate a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

699
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,270
gobbledygook at the bottom you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

700
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,010
signature that lets you verify the

701
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,879
things haven't changed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fly that they</font>

702
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:43,680
come from<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you thought they come</font>

703
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:45,390
from or if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't exist you can</font>

704
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,700
prove it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's pretty much all it</font>

705
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:49,710
is so DN a sec you know goes from a

706
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,790
hierarchy to just some gobbledygook in

707
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:57,180
our our sets and the gist of that really

708
00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:00,510
is just with one key on my resolver we

709
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,400
we expect or we hope that you wind up

710
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,930
being able to securely authenticate data

711
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,940
that you get from wherever it comes from

712
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:07,740
throughout the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS hierarchy whether</font>

713
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:10,020
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root a TLD the zone you're</font>

714
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,330
going to whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nsx job</font>

715
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,740
it's not to hide things it's not to

716
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:15,929
encrypt things it's not to protect your

717
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,050
privacy it's to make sure that when you

718
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:20,640
ask a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Schumann you you know</font>

719
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Warren who answered you</font>

720
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,130
whether or not you trust them is your

721
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:30,090
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> business so Doug telling that back</font>

722
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:32,310
to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Glenn teased um so DNS SEC is</font>

723
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,020
got this thing that we think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a killer</font>

724
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,070
app it's called Dane and there's a

725
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,350
handful of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

726
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,700
know are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very familiar with this but you</font>

727
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:40,050
know I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of go over at a</font>

728
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,060
really high level because it's really

729
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:45,090
brain-dead simple and that's I think one

730
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:46,620
of the the features and some people

731
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">started off by looking at what can you</font>

732
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,500
do with DNS SEC to help aid TLS how can

733
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,120
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> help TLS which is a fully robust</font>

734
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,500
mature protocol that we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> all over the</font>

735
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,649
place but how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you help it do a</font>

736
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,960
little bit better and as Glenn mentioned

737
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,940
DNS SEC is built on this notion of I

738
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,150
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a chain of trust I want to</font>

739
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">give you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one key for the DNS route the</font>

740
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:09,930
DNS set key for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root and I want that</font>

741
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:12,060
to change on to wherever you go in DNS

742
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:13,830
and what Dane says is well when you get

743
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:16,169
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going why don't we extend</font>

744
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:18,300
that chain over to the next thing so

745
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,490
like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to a web server from</font>

746
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,470
dub dub dub example com can you get a

747
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:24,030
chain a link of the chain that says

748
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:27,270
since you could validate all the way

749
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:29,310
down in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS world to dub dub dub why</font>

750
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,580
don't you also avout or validate over to

751
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:35,190
the key that comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> over that TLS session</font>

752
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:38,159
so to explain that let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me contrast it to</font>

753
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:40,710
what we do today so there's a there's a

754
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:43,770
pki a web<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki system that we use for</font>

755
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:45,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">HTTPS and what that basically is a whole</font>

756
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:47,580
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of certification authorities that</font>

757
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:51,900
all can attest anything that they want

758
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:55,050
and how you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that list is is not very</font>

759
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,600
is not standardized and it's not visible

760
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">to most users you basically just your</font>

761
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,389
machines and your browser's are born

762
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:02,100
with a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of keys you hope that</font>

763
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:03,840
they're kept<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to date and any one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

764
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,580
those keys associated with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">certification</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority can tell you</font>

766
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,980
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you've gone to a website</font>

767
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key matches that website so what</font>

768
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">that basically means is like it says at</font>

769
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,110
the bottom this there's a weakest link

770
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,820
problem and so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a number of</font>

771
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,709
notorious attacks did you noted was

772
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:21,060
probably one of the first well known

773
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,860
ones but<font color="#CCCCCC"> nefeli not the first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

774
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,629
definitely at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last where a rogue</font>

775
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:26,040
certification<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority or certification</font>

776
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:29,400
authority that had been compromised

777
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,139
issued some certificates for domains

778
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:33,540
that it shouldn't have because they

779
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,860
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a deal or because that</font>

780
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,320
domain had not purchased sore

781
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:39,419
certificates from them and those can be

782
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">served with impunity and no one can</font>

783
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,140
validate the difference because your

784
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:45,450
browser a relying party gets a

785
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,220
certificate and it says it's valid

786
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:49,380
because one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys said so and</font>

787
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,700
you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't even notice that let alone</font>

788
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you figure out whether</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

789
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:57,050
righteous or not yep you know if you

790
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:59,220
wonder whether that's really a problem

791
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:00,540
think about what you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

792
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,220
users do I know all you guys are

793
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">security aware and you'd never do that</font>

794
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,150
kind of thing but but how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many folks do</font>

795
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,470
you see click through the hey<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

796
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,060
server doesn't look like what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ought</font>

797
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look like do you want to accept or</font>

798
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:14,310
accept the exception you know who

799
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:18,889
actually reads that if you're not aware

800
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:22,799
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but all of us do all of us do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

801
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:25,139
alright so it's so what Eric's

802
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,940
mentioning I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know think about</font>

803
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:28,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">it you see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this all the time especially</font>

804
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,500
if you're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hurry trying to solve a</font>

805
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,299
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> a challenge comes up for ssh you</font>

806
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,650
get a host key oh yeah that's new<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

807
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:37,620
must be the right machine because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

808
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:39,300
typed in a dress to it and that's

809
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,159
assuming you even get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that dialog box</font>

810
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,630
because what's what's particularly

811
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,850
pernicious here is that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

812
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise like a CA that's in like you</font>

813
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:49,500
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's a it's a country CA</font>

814
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,149
and i can have that mint a certificate

815
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,029
for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> google or four</font>

816
00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:55,319
Ferris I'm sorry then you know your

817
00:34:54,029 --> 00:34:57,089
browser doesn't even warn you it's like

818
00:34:55,319 --> 00:35:00,089
yeah it looks like it past<font color="#CCCCCC"> a check it's</font>

819
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:02,700
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough so one of the things that</font>

820
00:35:00,089 --> 00:35:05,160
Dane does is it says well why don't you

821
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,598
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that domain Authority actually tell</font>

822
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,129
you what you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> expect on the other</font>

823
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:10,020
end of the channel so one of the

824
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,779
problems that TLS has with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach</font>

825
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:14,670
is that you go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> an untrusted channel</font>

826
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:16,920
you go over<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get back</font>

827
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,170
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get back a certificate and</font>

828
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,000
you expect that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be self verifying and</font>

829
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,700
the way you kind of made that all work

830
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,920
is you had you know depending on how you

831
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:27,808
count 170 or maybe even thousands of

832
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,010
different certificates that can verify

833
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all managed separately</font>

834
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:33,720
and whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> dane says well you got to</font>

835
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that IP address DNS SEC helped you</font>

836
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,669
verify it if you use it you should but

837
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,529
you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address why don't you</font>

838
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:42,510
ask the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same authority that gave that IP</font>

839
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:45,180
address what sort of crypto information

840
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:47,670
should you expect when you start a TLS

841
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:50,279
session you know it's sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like it</font>

842
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,770
should seem obvious upon inspection<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

843
00:35:50,279 --> 00:35:54,450
reflections like yeah you know if you if

844
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,160
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS was compromised you never got</font>

845
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:58,470
to that IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you're obviously</font>

846
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,660

847
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:01,919
data from dns and use DNS SEC to try and

848
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,720
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that when while you're there</font>

849
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,859
why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just find out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what you</font>

connection over an untrusted channel so

852
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,609
that's what Dane does that's one of the

853
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:13,680
things that Dane does actually Dane does

854
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:15,210
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than that so Dane we've been</font>

855
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,549
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about TLS but Dane is actually</font>

856
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:19,170
kind of like a multi-tenant system it's

857
00:36:17,549 --> 00:36:20,819
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a multi-tenant system in the</font>

858
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:23,039
sense that you ought to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

859
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:25,440
this same sort of extension of the chain

860
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,599
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust for other keying protocols</font>

861
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,200
whether that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for email for</font>

862
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,700
VPNs obviously for TLS etc and that's

863
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,169
it's sort of its goal and that's what's

864
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">being worked out now so some of this is</font>

865
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">more baked than other parts of it but</font>

866
00:36:36,299 --> 00:36:41,730
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of the simple</font>

867
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:44,520
observation that Dane makes guess so

868
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,630
it's I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna kind of like fly through</font>

869
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,950
this but I hope if somebody has

870
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:48,210
questions or comments or they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

871
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,368
agree you'll just jump up right away

872
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:53,069
because otherwise this will just be kind

873
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:54,779
of boring but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Danes basically trying to</font>

874
00:36:53,069 --> 00:36:56,130
be kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this well my</font>

875
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,599
interpretation to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane so we have like</font>

876
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,819
one of the co-chairs in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I I</font>

877
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,079
expect it he'll keep me honest um one of

878
00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that you could look at is I</font>

879
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:04,680
want to I want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

881
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,690
is securely for protocols that need them

882
00:37:06,869 --> 00:37:13,500
so it uses dns and in the dns sort of

883
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,000
transaction chain there's a couple

884
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,010
places where there can be an adversary

885
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,809
it can be during the provisioning staged

886
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:20,250
a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> claimed oh well that's</font>

887
00:37:18,809 --> 00:37:22,380
not a very secure approach because

888
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:24,030
someone can you know go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to my registrar</font>

889
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,140
and muck with my zone it's like yeah

890
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:26,609
then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> never would have got your a</font>

891
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,589

892
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:30,540
that IPO just never got there but that

893
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:32,430
is a valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern so there's a point of</font>

894
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,839
vulnerability there there's a point of

895
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:35,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">vulnerability between recursive</font>

the extension the chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> of trust it's</font>

904
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,410
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and protect you against all</font>

905
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,750
those so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can just simply say I've</font>

906
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:56,250
got a key that is associated with some

907
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:57,839
secure whatever the heck I'm gonna put

908
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,950
it somewhere and then someone that

909
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:00,630
you've never met<font color="#CCCCCC"> before it can say I</font>

910
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:02,160
stumbled across your key and I'm going

911
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:04,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use it now and i'm just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

912
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,140
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust that security was managed</font>

913
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:09,390
in the middle by using DNS SEC by using

914
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:11,730
gain I don't have to worry about oh gosh

915
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:14,160
how do I learn your email key because

916
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,200
you know how many signatures and they in

917
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,180
the web of trust is sufficient blah blah

918
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,410
blah you just say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just gives Dane</font>

919
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,000
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I can look in the</font>

00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:22,529
protocol and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look at the details but</font>

921
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,530
this is supposed to be utility that

922
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:27,420
people can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so there's a number</font>

923
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">of discussions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people are starting to</font>

924
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,140
bring up specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> around s/mime</font>

925
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:39,569
specifically around openpgp there's some

926
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:41,339
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones about XMPP XMPP ipsec etc a</font>

927
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:44,009
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protocols that are very mature</font>

928
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:46,890
that have you know varying deployment

929
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">bases that may have reached difficulty</font>

930
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:52,589
in full internet scale deployment

931
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:55,980
because of key learning problems and so

932
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:59,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit rot I'm</font>

933
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">gonna</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Danes basically one of the</font>

934
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,000
things that it does well those a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

935
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,410
louder is it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sort of</font>

936
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,910
like going to repeat myself here just

937
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,529
sort of like extends a transaction

938
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:10,259
change from hop-by-hop it sort of says

939
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:12,420
hey um the provisioning if you can

940
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,079
secure the provisioning concern secure

941
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:17,640
the channel between recursive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and name</font>

942
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,450
server then you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to worry</font>

943
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,980
about

944
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,328
how you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that key you just found it</font>

945
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,820
in DNS just like you found<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

946
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:26,940
else and that's kind of its simple

947
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:28,650
observation so you know it's so simple

948
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:30,119
that it's it's it's too bad it<font color="#CCCCCC"> took me</font>

949
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:32,820
so long to say all this because really

950
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:35,700
what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just says is if DNS SEC is</font>

951
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:36,960
operational and deployed today then why

952
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,140
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just put your crypto keys in</font>

953
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,780
there and if you have a protocol or a

954
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:45,270
service that is using DNS domain names

955
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,849
then why don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just let that same</font>

956
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,890
infrastructure offer the key learning so

957
00:39:47,849 --> 00:39:53,010
you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bootstrap everything from</font>

958
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:55,049
s/mime the PGP to ipsec to TLS to

959
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,430
whatever else and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

960
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:59,730
probably worth noting and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

961
00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:03,810
this really loudly Dane does not obviate

962
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:06,420
the need for CAS it can if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want it</font>

963
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:09,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't have to and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't say</font>

964
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,900
this often enough the the Dane approach

965
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:14,520
is actually very compatible with

966
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:16,560
certification authorities certification

967
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:18,329
authorities do something different than

968
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,980
make sure that the domain name in the

969
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:22,470
crypto key belong together they do that

970
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:24,270
but they also say I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you</font>

971
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,578
some notion of trust I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

972
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:28,619
a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> green bar that says you're at</font>

973
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:30,690
Bank of America not bonk of America or

974
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:33,390
something like that and that's that you

975
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,460
know if I go to bank of america yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

976
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,750
went<font color="#CCCCCC"> there if I think that that's the</font>

977
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:39,030
place where I have all my money I'm

978
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,650
wrong certification authorities try and

979
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:43,170
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me figure out that last part and</font>

980
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:46,470
Dane actually has protocol semantics to

981
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:49,740
embrace that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to kick it</font>

982
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:51,959
back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Glen though yeah so this my</font>

983
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,220
background is the development so I have

984
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,599
to put at least something that looks

985
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:57,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of like a function signature in</font>

986
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,890
every slide every deck but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're</font>

987
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:03,770
used to doing if you do any development

988
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:07,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">lib see entry points for DNS or this and</font>

989
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:09,119
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see DNS SEC related</font>

990
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,839
stuff Dane related stuff in those<font color="#CCCCCC"> lipsy</font>

991
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,089
entry points um my encouragement is that

992
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:17,490
there are a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> good alternatives to</font>

993
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:19,589
the traditional entry points there's

994
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:22,169
we've got very<font color="#E5E5E5"> signs been involved with</font>

995
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:24,180
in on that labs on get dns just based on

996
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,040
lib unbound there there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are plenty of</font>

997
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:29,819
other language bindings that give you

998
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:31,829
visibility into<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sac and the Dane</font>

999
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:32,190
bits they can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them work</font>

1000
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:34,050
you

1001
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,980
don't have to wait for somebody to build

1002
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:40,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">something the stuffs already there</font>

1003
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:43,920
signing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a zone is really easy and I'd</font>

1004
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,480
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say specific registrar names</font>

1005
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:47,700
here but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I'm allowed to do</font>

1006
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:49,740
that so but but I'll tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> what there</font>

1007
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:52,109
are plenty of registrar's that offer the

1008
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,149
means to sign your zones they walk you

1009
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:57,598
through it they give visual you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1010
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:58,829
know if pretty pictures irritate you

1011
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,420
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be irritating there are</font>

1012
00:41:58,829 --> 00:42:02,069
other ways to do it but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you</font>

1013
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,140
don't want to learn if you don't become

1014
00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:05,550
a DNS expert there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are plenty of</font>

1015
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:08,549
registrar's out there that will do it if

1016
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,920
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not supporting DNS SEC ask them</font>

1017
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:12,930
so when I've talked to registrar's often

1018
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:15,329
the ones who don't support d in a sec

1019
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:21,000
yet the responses will we don't hear

1020
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:23,040
people calling for it yet yeah yeah

1021
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,500
that's that's a requirement yeah comment

1022
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,390
being that all the new gTLDs have to do

1023
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,920
DNS SEC out of the box yeah that's great

1024
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:33,660
so like I said if your registrar doesn't

1025
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,589
support it ask them to and if they don't

1026
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:40,589
find a better registrar which you end up

1027
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:42,210
with is this lovely<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D s record</font>

1028
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:44,490
that's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that ties everything</font>

1029
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:48,150
together you can create that along with

1030
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:49,919
your keys with one command it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1031
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,599
not that hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can find much harder</font>

1032
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,230
ways to do it there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a number</font>

1033
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:58,800
of documented mechanisms that take 67

1034
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,910
pages of fine typed commands you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1035
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you like it if you don't want</font>

1036
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:03,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pretty stuff but but the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fact is</font>

1037
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,190
it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard and I left out</font>

1038
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:07,310
some other details<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to move a</font>

1039
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,020
few files around but the bottom line is

1040
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:13,950
signing your zones just it's not

1041
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:15,780
difficult the other thing I'd add one of

1042
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:18,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the objections I've heard in the past is</font>

1043
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,650
I'm putting too much trust in DNS the

1044
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:24,149
DNS is taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on too much responsibility</font>

1045
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,619
when we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and move to Deanna sex start</font>

1046
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:28,140
moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys in here to do some of the</font>

1047
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:30,900
stuff that Eric talked about and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1048
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,980
challenge to that is you already trust

1049
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,990
the DNS kind of an into an insane degree

1050
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,450
I mean when was last time you verified

1051
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:43,709
even the IP address it got back from a

1052
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:45,808
name lookup you're okay wrong people ask

1053
00:43:43,710 --> 00:43:48,170
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> seriously though you</font>

1054
00:43:45,809 --> 00:43:50,880
people inherently trusted in us

1055
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:52,380
tremendously the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of armoring it and</font>

1056
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,819
using it to deliver keys for other

1057
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:57,989
things makes perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense yeah and just</font>

1058
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:59,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">before we go to the question they</font>

1059
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:01,229
definitely get that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to</font>

1060
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,569
underscore I think one of the big points

1061
00:44:01,229 --> 00:44:04,709
of the talk today was to say a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

1062
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:05,999
have probably heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS saying how</font>

1063
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:09,328
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have heard of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane before</font>

1064
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:12,089
today awesome so glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that many</font>

1065
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:13,289
hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so yeah so hopefully we're</font>

1066
00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:14,849
preaching to the choir but what we

1067
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:17,939
really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is get on record and</font>

1068
00:44:14,849 --> 00:44:19,920
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dena sec is very very doable there's</font>

1069
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:23,038
now a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear reason to do it and</font>

1070
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,229
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear reason is something that you</font>

1071
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,880
could maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> even expect end-users to</font>

1072
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:28,979
push for so suddenly there's a reason

1073
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">for people to say why would i pay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extra</font>

1074
00:44:28,979 --> 00:44:31,410
or why would it<font color="#CCCCCC"> go through the extra</font>

1075
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:32,939
effort for Dina sex so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was really</font>

1076
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,959
what we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> underscore is a whole</font>

1077
00:44:32,939 --> 00:44:37,140
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that have sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

1078
00:44:33,959 --> 00:44:39,239
together and some operational pain for

1079
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:44,910
the last few years with DNS ekta's maybe

1080
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:47,519
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay off questions Brett Watson</font>

1081
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:49,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">Infoblox don't we still have a problem</font>

1082
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:52,678
and Eric you touched on this when you

1083
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:54,509
first started chatting when we have

1084
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,339
certificate authorities and our browsers

1085
00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:57,749
that we have no I no way how to validate

1086
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:59,939
knowing whether they're good or bad

1087
00:44:57,749 --> 00:45:02,069
don't we still have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with bad</font>

1088
00:44:59,939 --> 00:45:03,959
certificates well so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1089
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:06,959
things I really love about Dane is that

1090
00:45:03,959 --> 00:45:08,910
with that with Dane you don't need those

1091
00:45:06,959 --> 00:45:11,129
anymore if you don't want to use them so

1092
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:13,469
Dane basically makes it<font color="#CCCCCC"> unambiguous</font>

1093
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,779
whether you got the cert that the domain

1094
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:17,069
holder wanted to serve you or not now

1095
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,809
the certification authorities are still

1096
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:20,249
the place you would go in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

1097
00:45:18,809 --> 00:45:21,900
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know do I trust it do they have a</font>

1098
00:45:20,249 --> 00:45:23,160
CFO are they like do they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font>

1099
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,199
address is there a building there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1100
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:27,029
that's really useful but it makes it

1101
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:28,619
unambiguous that this domain is bound to

1102
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:30,900
that key<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that right now the</font>

1103
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:32,789
certification authorities they conflate

1104
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,979
those two goals together and it kind of

1105
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:36,539
weakens the overall approach I don't

1106
00:45:34,979 --> 00:45:38,729
know if we made it clear but but you

1107
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,949
know the TLS a record allows for you to

1108
00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:42,629
publish I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did put it in one of</font>

1109
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:46,849
the slides but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it allows you to publish</font>

1110
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:49,650
a key or reference to a CA so you can

1111
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:51,390
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use either if you feel</font>

1112
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:56,130
better about what you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing put your</font>

1113
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:57,868
own keys in there as I a comment in a

oddly enough the u.s. is<font color="#CCCCCC"> second bottom</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. is only second bottom it's still</font>

1129
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,270
good but it's not brilliant the question

1130
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,490
there was actually more about Dane and

1131
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:46,310
bootstrapping and tying it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim</font>

1132
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:50,810
stuff about a secure relationship

1133
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:53,390
between me and by resolver how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1134
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:55,880
see that bootstrap I make theoretically

1135
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:59,660
I can embed some keys to use for TLS

1136
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:02,120
itself somewhere inside the dns and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1137
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,460
can name my resolver with a name so in

1138
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,790
some ways I'm if I have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root keys I</font>

1139
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,160
can bootstrap myself up how do you

1140
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:15,290
envisage that with working or am I going

1141
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,670
way too fast so I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1142
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:19,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">think anyone has settled their thinking</font>

1143
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:20,900
on this yet but um a couple of us have

1144
00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:23,060
put together a draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's floating</font>

1145
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:27,200
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane that would do opportunistic</font>

1146
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:29,270
keying for ipsec tunnels whereby if you

1147
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:31,490
have the address the IP address of your

1148
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:33,110
recursive resolver then you either

1149
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,580
probably have it in private space or

1150
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:36,110
it's probably a public recursive

1151
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:39,230
resolver and in either those two cases

1152
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:41,240
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have the management of that</font>

1153
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:43,460
probably has access to the river stone

1154
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,140
so you can do a reverse lookup do full

1155
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:47,630
chain validation with the stub like get

1156
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:50,330
dns that gun was talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1157
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:52,730
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say this IP set key now i will</font>

1158
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:55,880
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> an opportunity ipsec tunnel so</font>

1159
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:58,700
yeah that's some of the things yeah the

1160
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,110
point is you don't if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard</font>

1161
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,390
noticed about it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to trust</font>

1162
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:04,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the resolver beyond your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> machine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

1163
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:07,910
do the iteration locally and be very

1164
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:09,530
confident that<font color="#E5E5E5"> its sound oh I had a</font>

1165
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,910
question on Dane I know a lot of people

1166
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">raise their hand saying they know about</font>

1167
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:15,230
it but how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have actually</font>

1168
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:20,720
tried to deploy Dane in their dns

1169
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:23,480
besides<font color="#E5E5E5"> Warren so oh wait so so yeah I</font>

1170
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,459
think it's it's I think it's something

1171
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,720
people know but it's but that's what

1172
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:28,310
I've serve run across<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like it's</font>

1173
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,959
still like they haven't actually made

1174
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:32,540
that hurdle yet right they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have</font>

1175
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:35,990
ensigns owns either so if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could ask a</font>

1176
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:38,060
semi unfair question how many people got

1177
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:39,470
a little bit of extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge about</font>

1178
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:40,549
Dane out of the talk today a lot of

1179
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">people said they knew it which is great</font>

1180
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:44,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">but I mean was this informative and</font>

1181
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,250
useful even like a little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

1182
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's good because it's great that so</font>

1183
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,340
many people knew what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was it's it's</font>

1184
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:51,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">really great if we can sort of like you</font>

1185
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:53,330
know spread like to point the<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-point</font>

1186
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:55,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tim's making you know I mean whether you</font>

1187
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:57,350
play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it or not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really want</font>

1188
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,700
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand it too because sort</font>

1189
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:01,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">of to the point one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the points Tim</font>

1190
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:03,109
made in his talk you know understanding

1191
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:08,420
that DNS SEC is doing this job and not

1192
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:10,250
that job is really important to Michael

1193
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,740
Sinatra<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not just a reminder that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

1194
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:15,650
we implement new resource record types

1195
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:19,430
it needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the eye</font>

1196
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:22,250
Pam people and so those of us who would

1197
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:25,580
love to deploy Dane right now can't

1198
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:27,140
always do it because either<font color="#E5E5E5"> RI PM</font>

1199
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:30,290
doesn't support it it might be on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1200
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:32,390
road map we hope it is or we haven't

1201
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:34,360
upgraded yet and we need to find time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1202
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,770
do that the latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ipam</font>

1203
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:39,470
so that would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reason that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1204
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:41,750
actually the former reason is the reason

1205
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:43,970
that I haven't yet done it so that

1206
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:46,400
that's sort of where we're stuck in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1207
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:48,500
my personal vanity domains yeah I can

1208
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,430
play around with all I want but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1209
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:53,840
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of my pants yeah and we so we</font>

1210
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:56,270
need to push on that too that's just one

1211
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">more thing i think that's that's a</font>

1212
00:49:56,270 --> 00:50:00,530
really good point and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess one of</font>

1213
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:04,100
the hopes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we have is that as</font>

1214
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:06,380
Dane start to make it because Dan is

1215
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,060
kind of like an eyeball<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused kind of</font>

1216
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,920
service you know you want like secure

1217
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:11,960
email and that's a user thing you want

1218
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,760
you know TLS and browser maybe that's a

1219
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,560
user thing that hopefully that helps us

1220
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:19,100
add<font color="#E5E5E5"> more pressure for adoption but yeah</font>

1221
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,960
it's just like oh and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meet</font>

1222
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,480
some of those fish

1223
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,099
that are validating queries I love that

1224
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:31,859
I'm wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the missing one</font>

1225
00:50:24,099 --> 00:50:37,300
percent of those five fishermen is ok

1226
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:39,009
any other questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um then our last</font>

1227
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,080
talk is with Dave Levin from the

1228
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:44,080
University of Maryland I mean he's going

1229
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,869
to be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about an address change so</font>

1230
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,680
we will have our usual little<font color="#CCCCCC"> audio</font>

1231
00:50:46,869 --> 00:50:49,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">visual shuffle</font>

1232
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:13,520
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy okay hey folks my</font>

1233
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:15,950
name is Dave Levin from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the University</font>

1234
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,720
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Maryland and those you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1235
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:20,149
University<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maryland has always hosted</font>

1236
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,850
the D root name server and early last

1237
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:24,770
year it changed its IP address this is a

1238
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:26,960
pretty historic event and so what I'm

1239
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:28,340
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> present is some measurement</font>

1240
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,910
studies that we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that explain some of</font>

1241
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,990
the phenomena surrounding this

1242
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:36,140
unfortunately probably last in a

1243
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:38,359
lifetime event so just as a quick recap

1244
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:40,580
root servers served the root zone the

1245
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:44,000
root zone sits at the top of the DNS

1246
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:46,069
hierarchy this is the you know the place

1247
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,950
of last resort right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if I'm querying</font>

1248
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:50,720
for say umd.edu if I don't know um d and

1249
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:52,700
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know II to you I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

1250
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,500
the route if I know nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else but I</font>

1251
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:58,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach the root then I</font>

1252
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:00,170
can resolve a query and so therefore

1253
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:02,480
everybody needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know every resolver</font>

1254
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:04,910
needs to know how to access one of the

1255
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:07,250
root servers and the root server has to

1256
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:09,950
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available so because it's such a</font>

1257
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:11,300
critical part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the infrastructure the</font>

1258
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:14,240
root zone isn't hosted by one logical

1259
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:17,150
entity toast by 13 logical entities um

1260
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,430
and in fact each one isn't just a single

1261
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:21,320
machine of course we use IP anycast so

1262
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:23,839
as of the end of or start at the

1263
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:26,270
beginning of 2013 this was roughly the

1264
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:29,360
number of instances / root node so as

1265
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:31,310
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D here had one so we did not</font>

1266
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:33,890
support any cast at the time so in order

1267
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:39,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support any IP anycast we had to</font>

1268
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:41,540
change addresses excuse me there we go

1269
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:46,130
right so we had to move from maryland /

1270
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:48,770
16 to a / 24 that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can had provided so</font>

1271
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:52,640
in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support this way to change</font>

1272
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:54,350
IP addresses but to help carry over<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1273
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:56,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both the old and new addresses</font>

1274
00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:57,470
so first why is this a big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1275
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:59,960
we're changing addresses well first off

1276
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:01,370
let's talk about how resolvers learn

1277
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,710
about this new address there's basically

1278
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:05,810
two ways the first is via some

1279
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:10,040
out-of-band mechanism so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance in</font>

1280
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">their hints file they'll maintain the NS</font>

1281
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:13,430
and a records for each of the different

1282
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:15,920
root servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many resolvers</font>

1283
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:18,049
even hard code the addresses for the 13

1284
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,430
root servers in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code so Wendy root</font>

1285
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:21,170
changed its address sure enough there

1286
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:24,169
were software patches<font color="#E5E5E5"> 22</font>

1287
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:25,700
most resolvers now once it sort of

1288
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:28,460
initializes sort of a bootstrapping

1289
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:29,598
phase so long as a resolver can hit any

1290
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,200
of the root servers they can all just

1291
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,819
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue priming queries which they do</font>

1292
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:37,160
prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the TTL running out so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1293
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:39,079
a 68 TTL for these root servers and so

1294
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:43,250
they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> also find out live what's going</font>

1295
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:45,500
on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of Maryland in order to</font>

1296
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:48,530
help make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that this transition when</font>

1297
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:51,710
smoothly started announcing just the new

1298
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:54,740
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> but still resolved queries to</font>

1299
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:58,099
the old address so in our experiments we

1300
00:53:54,740 --> 00:54:00,169
collected some samples set of the data

1301
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:02,500
so on average as we'll see d route was

1302
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:05,390
getting about 15,000 queries per second

1303
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:07,549
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> captured samples of that traffic and</font>

1304
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:10,279
also so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could pinpoint when</font>

1305
00:54:07,549 --> 00:54:11,869
exactly particular clients switched over

1306
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,369
from the old address to the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> address</font>

1307
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:15,559
we also had some code running that

1308
00:54:13,369 --> 00:54:17,299
looked at every single query and kept

1309
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:20,390
track of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you know this</font>

1310
00:54:17,299 --> 00:54:22,759
was this this particular IP address had

1311
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:23,839
switched over to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new one so let's</font>

1312
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">take into the change over a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

1313
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:27,349
so we also have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of preamble</font>

1314
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:30,109
data about day and a half ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1315
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:31,280
change and this was so all traffic was

1316
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:33,799
going to the old address and as you can

1317
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,740
see us about 15,000 queries per second

1318
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:38,299
so what we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expected this is</font>

1319
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,069
what we expected to see happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1320
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:42,349
we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> start showing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quarries then</font>

1321
00:54:40,069 --> 00:54:44,210
from this day both to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old address</font>

1322
00:54:42,349 --> 00:54:46,160
and to the new address and what you

1323
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:47,599
might expect if you take a step back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1324
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,069
think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queries to</font>

1325
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,930
the old address might decrease over time

1326
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:53,359
right the quarries to the new address

1327
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:55,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">would increase over time and we expected</font>

1328
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:57,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> overall the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> query volume would stay</font>

1329
00:54:55,579 --> 00:54:59,750
the same right if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good</font>

1330
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:01,970
server for you all right somebody

1331
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:08,180
shaking their head right so in reality

1332
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:10,578
what happens is that the CEO some

1333
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">annotation to write the queries to the</font>

1334
00:55:10,579 --> 00:55:15,140
new address<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up very very quickly</font>

1335
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:17,450
the quarries to the old address dropped

1336
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,279
off<font color="#E5E5E5"> some but kind of held off at this</font>

1337
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:22,609
rate and the overall query volume

1338
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:25,010
actually increased by almost fifty

1339
00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:26,598
percent and in fact this wasn't just

1340
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:28,190
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a weird well you know we're kind of</font>

1341
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:30,190
you know figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> things out so even you</font>

1342
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,930
know almost four months later<font color="#E5E5E5"> these same</font>

1343
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:34,670
properties persisted so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that</font>

1344
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is quite strange right so</font>

1345
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,630
over

1346
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,250
query volume has increased resolvers

1347
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:43,320
were still heavily heavily using the old

1348
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:44,910
address so we saw these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and we</font>

1349
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,930
said what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the heck is going on and in</font>

1350
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:47,730
fact you know when we spoke to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1351
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:50,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">d-word operators they said oh yeah we</font>

1352
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:51,840
were told to to expect this and in fact

1353
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,340
we're looking at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the old</font>

1354
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,040
literature that somebody had written up

1355
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:57,990
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob je root and they found similar</font>

1356
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,740
properties as well but nobody<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

1357
00:55:57,990 --> 00:56:03,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">explained or why why was this happening</font>

1358
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,129
this is really really strange what's

1359
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,530
going on here another property that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1360
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,940
happen to see also was that queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1361
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,050
the old address forces<font color="#CCCCCC"> graciously the</font>

1362
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,970
new<font color="#E5E5E5"> address had very very different</font>

1363
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:14,730
failure rates so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really expect</font>

1364
00:56:11,970 --> 00:56:17,430
so long as everybody's caching correctly

1365
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:20,010
most of the queries to route should fail

1366
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:25,020
these should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be typos weird things right</font>

1367
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:26,670
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be um ideally caching most of</font>

1368
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,500
the you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you have com you should</font>

1369
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,030
be cashing that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example so the real</font>

1370
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,320
question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> why why are these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

1371
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,580
happening why is there such a

1372
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,470
discrepancy in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> failure rates why are</font>

1373
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:36,569
we getting so much traffic to the old

1374
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:39,450
address and why<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the overall volume</font>

1375
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:40,980
increase so we'd seen these phenomena

1376
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,779
nobody quite answer why today I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1377
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,040
to show you why we start off this is

1378
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,900
also the outline of my talk so I'm going

1379
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:48,390
to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> off by discussing overall query</font>

1380
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:50,570
volume increase so to explain something

1381
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:53,160
this there's there's basically two

1382
00:56:50,570 --> 00:56:55,080
potential reasons either there were

1383
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:59,339
resolvers coming to us who hadn't come

1384
00:56:55,080 --> 00:57:00,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">to us before or or summer solvers who</font>

1385
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:02,520
had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be going to us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before the</font>

1386
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:05,760
changeover are suddenly issuing more

1387
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:08,160
traffic or potentially both it turned

1388
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,050
out however that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw fewer</font>

1389
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,120
resolvers than before the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of her</font>

1390
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:13,740
solvers coming to us did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not increase so</font>

1391
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:16,200
the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> remaining explanation was that</font>

1392
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:18,120
there must be more queries coming from

1393
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:20,669
the set of resolvers who used to be

1394
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to us even the day before so we</font>

1395
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:27,840
look at then is the queries per second

1396
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:29,610
per / 24 on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day before the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 24 hours</font>

1397
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:32,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">before the changeover and the 24 hours</font>

1398
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:34,530
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so anybody who issued who had</font>

1399
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:36,660
no change in query volume would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be right</font>

1400
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:38,880
on this x equals<font color="#CCCCCC"> y</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line this one x line</font>

1401
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:40,470
right and we would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected that</font>

1402
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,630
everything would have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around this</font>

1403
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:44,419
line mod some variation of sampling and

1404
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:46,830
whatever the query<font color="#E5E5E5"> value might have been</font>

1405
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:48,180
so here's what we actually see so these

1406
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,859
lines i'm showing you so we have the 1x

1407
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:51,558
line the two

1408
00:57:48,859 --> 00:57:54,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">sign 10 x + 100</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X so those above the</font>

1409
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:57,410
hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> x line are folks who issued a</font>

1410
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:59,930
hundred times more<font color="#E5E5E5"> queries the day after</font>

1411
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:01,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the changeover than the day before so we</font>

1412
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:03,230
classify and in fact there's some folks

1413
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:06,339
who even sent ten thousand times more

1414
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:08,930
queries<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> route the day after</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um</font>

1415
00:58:06,339 --> 00:58:10,940
so we classified these yellow dots or

1416
00:58:08,930 --> 00:58:13,069
anybody who had more than doubled volume

1417
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:15,170
when we changed over as excitable these

1418
00:58:13,069 --> 00:58:17,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">were the clients the resolvers that got</font>

1419
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:19,549
very excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address change</font>

1420
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:22,009
and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to visit d route a lot</font>

1421
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:24,259
and in fact these were exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1422
00:58:22,009 --> 00:58:26,450
account for the the increase in volume

1423
00:58:24,259 --> 00:58:28,279
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> still there's the question of why</font>

1424
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:29,808
why did<font color="#CCCCCC"> they do this so we did a little</font>

1425
00:58:28,279 --> 00:58:31,549
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of detective work and where do you</font>

1426
00:58:29,809 --> 00:58:33,920
start with detective work well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you dust</font>

1427
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:35,720
for prints so we tried FP<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

1428
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:37,880
fingerprinting some of these domains and

1429
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:39,169
the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is most of these excitable we</font>

1430
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,819
weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to fingerprint them that's</font>

1431
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:43,849
our first<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of evidence there's some</font>

1432
00:58:40,819 --> 00:58:46,549
resolvers that are kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of known not to</font>

1433
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:48,109
not be supported by FB<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS so that was</font>

1434
00:58:46,549 --> 00:58:50,480
sort of our first narrowed down a little

1435
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:52,239
bit additionally the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other piece of</font>

1436
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">evidence was the spike queried</font>

1437
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:56,569
distribution the fact that some folks

1438
00:58:54,289 --> 00:58:58,069
suddenly just latched<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto us and</font>

1439
00:58:56,569 --> 00:59:00,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">started issuing tons and tons of queries</font>

1440
00:58:58,069 --> 00:59:02,180
and also this frequent reap rhyming so

1441
00:59:00,499 --> 00:59:04,910
the fact that the new<font color="#E5E5E5"> address we thought</font>

1442
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:06,649
you know with details of six days<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1443
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:08,299
it would have the new traffic to the new

1444
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,190
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have slowly ramped up but</font>

1445
00:59:08,299 --> 00:59:12,380
instead it just jumped up very quickly

1446
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:14,390
which indicates that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there reprime</font>

1447
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:16,759
aquick<font color="#CCCCCC"> ly than that maybe is strictly</font>

1448
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:18,379
necessary the final piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence</font>

1449
00:59:16,759 --> 00:59:20,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that when we looked at where these</font>

1450
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:22,579
queries were coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from we saw a heavy</font>

1451
00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:26,420
concentration in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Europe so these things</font>

1452
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:28,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">all together led us to believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1453
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:31,099
issue is actually with a particular

1454
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:33,859
resolver which is powered DNS I'm seeing

1455
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:35,480
some head nod so yeah and in fact was so

1456
00:59:33,859 --> 00:59:37,630
we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of curious about this so</font>

1457
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:41,210
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this amazing undergrad in our lab</font>

1458
00:59:37,630 --> 00:59:42,920
set up an emulated network ran 13 root

1459
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:45,890
servers in this network and then ran

1460
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:48,529
powered DMS and then introduced a new

1461
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:50,450
route and here's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened so this</font>

1462
00:59:48,529 --> 00:59:53,029
orange line here if you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see this was</font>

1463
00:59:50,450 --> 00:59:56,960
the client was set up running power DNS

1464
00:59:53,029 --> 00:59:58,730
version 3.5<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the best</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root server for</font>

1465
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,579
that particular client as set up in this

1466
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:02,360
emulated network was<font color="#E5E5E5"> H and then we added</font>

1467
01:00:01,579 --> 01:00:05,180
a new

1468
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:07,100
d<font color="#E5E5E5"> root just as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before which had latency</font>

1469
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:08,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 85 milliseconds so basically what it</font>

1470
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,950
boiled down to and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

1471
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:12,049
replicated switched over latched on

1472
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:15,230
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new d root even though</font>

1473
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:19,460
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was by far not the BET almost eight</font>

1474
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:22,270
times worse latency so it turns<font color="#E5E5E5"> out that</font>

1475
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:25,510
it has to do with this underground went

1476
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:30,050
tracked<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the bug surprise surprise</font>

1477
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:32,690
c++ template scariness um submitted a

1478
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:34,190
bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> report as far as we I know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1479
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:38,120
ticket is still unfortunately open at

1480
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:39,950
this time um this grant this undergrad

1481
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,680
is now grad student and doing really

1482
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:44,740
good stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer these questions</font>

1483
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:47,180
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is we blow down that the</font>

1484
01:00:44,740 --> 01:00:49,250
excitable this increase in overall

1485
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:52,910
traffic volume could be explained by a

1486
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:54,380
bug<font color="#CCCCCC"> in powered dms now what's going on</font>

1487
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:56,420
with the old address that why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1488
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:59,540
still seeing so much traffic to the old

1489
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:01,190
one so question is who's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to it we</font>

1490
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:02,750
expected most folks to update correctly

1491
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:05,510
we expect everybody to go from the old

1492
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:06,830
to the new but in reality what happened

1493
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:09,530
was that sixty-three percent of folks

1494
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:11,569
stuck with the old nine percent kind of

1495
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:12,740
swapped back and forth and only

1496
01:01:11,570 --> 01:01:16,040
twenty-eight percent switched the new

1497
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:17,810
and stuck with it so we call the folks

1498
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,310
that stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the old is barnacles</font>

1499
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:21,410
they're just stuck onto the side of it

1500
01:01:19,310 --> 01:01:22,460
never switch over and those who kind of

1501
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:25,069
can't make up their mind we call them

1502
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:26,150
swappers so what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna talk about</font>

1503
01:01:25,070 --> 01:01:27,710
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about what</font>

1504
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:29,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened with the barnacles happy to</font>

1505
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:31,490
talk offline about what we think was

1506
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:33,350
going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the swappers but I want to</font>

1507
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:35,569
dig<font color="#E5E5E5"> into is what was going on why why</font>

1508
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:38,540
were some folks just<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuck to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the old</font>

1509
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:41,210
address so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the types</font>

1510
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:43,310
of queries they were issuing then we see

1511
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:44,960
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> different types on different</font>

1512
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:47,960
ends of the spectrum so some we see that

1513
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,000
are really random and always fail these

1514
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,160
are just garbage queries right here

1515
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,420
totally random things<font color="#E5E5E5"> otherwise one</font>

1516
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,819
sometimes what we see is we see very

1517
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,220
predictable ones that always succeed

1518
01:01:55,820 --> 01:02:00,530
okay so this gives us two features the

1519
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,910
two features we look at our how diverse

1520
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:03,590
are the queries coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1521
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:06,529
different resolvers and different IP

1522
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:08,120
addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what is their failure rate</font>

1523
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,800
and it turns out if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use these as</font>

1524
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:11,900
features you plot these against one

1525
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:13,670
another then a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few things are going to</font>

1526
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">fall out from this so first of all what</font>

1527
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:16,040
would we expect when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at failure</font>

1528
01:02:15,290 --> 01:02:18,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate</font>

1529
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,820
is query diversity well ideally it

1530
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:22,280
should be in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> upper right hand corner</font>

1531
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay you should be failing most of the</font>

1532
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,370
time because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cashing and</font>

1533
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:28,270
doing your negative cash incorrectly at

1534
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:30,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time ideally you have varying</font>

1535
01:02:28,270 --> 01:02:32,300
diversity you're not just constantly

1536
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:33,860
asking what's dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> cómo what see Emma</font>

1537
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,810
what's it right you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cat that</font>

1538
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,220
since I view the<font color="#E5E5E5"> y-axis sort of is</font>

1539
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,990
negative cashing employment correctly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1540
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:40,490
view the x axis as this positive cashing

1541
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:42,350
employment correctly we should be in the

1542
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:43,939
upper<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corner so we did it</font>

1543
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:46,960
first is to kind of sanity check these

1544
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:50,150
features we picked a few normals so some

1545
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:53,960

some that are sort of distributed

1550
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:02,120

01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:04,850
where there<font color="#CCCCCC"> were some ephemeral</font>

1552
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:06,740
misconfigurations where we saw a tunt

1553
01:03:04,850 --> 01:03:08,420
like this huge burst of queries to dot

1554
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:10,549
internal so clearly there was some

1555
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:11,870
internal private namespace that somehow

1556
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:13,280
ended up leaking out for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> short period</font>

1557
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:15,410
of time but for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most part they're in</font>

01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,730
the upper<font color="#E5E5E5"> right-hand corner there now</font>

1559
01:03:15,410 --> 01:03:19,730
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these barnacles these</font>

1560
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:22,010
folks that stick to the old address very

1561
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:24,500
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different picture here this is not</font>

01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:29,450
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to notice here is that the</font>

1564
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:32,120

1566
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,259
keep issuing successful queries over and

01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,420
over and over<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so this captures a</font>

1568
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:40,900
lot of these are DNS blacklist checkers

1569
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:43,190
that just have this large list of

1570
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:45,320
domains and just keep checking<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch</font>

01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:48,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them there are some who fit into this</font>

1572
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,260
normal category so they may be perfectly

1573
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:53,450
normal say ISPs or different route

1574
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,430
solvers who just happened not to reprime

1575
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:58,700
for whatever reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really clear to</font>

1576
01:03:55,430 --> 01:04:00,379
us why um additionally we see a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1577
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:02,029
these barnacles who query from a very

1578
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:04,700
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small set over and over and</font>

1579
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:07,250
over we believe these to be perhaps

1580
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:08,960
embedded devices or mechanized bots that

1581
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,980
are using the root server as a means of

1582
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,930
just checking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see if they have</font>

1583
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:14,240
connectivity that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright pappases</font>

1584
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:17,240
there so to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer these questions we</font>

1585
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:21,109
believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both this latching onto the</font>

1586
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:23,029
old address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the low failure rates to</font>

1587
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:24,740
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old address can both be explained by</font>

1588
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:27,110
these barnacles which are results of

1589
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:29,770
misconfigurations bugs scanners and so

1590
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:32,080
on so this summarizes what

1591
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:35,200
up in with the changeover I'd also like

1592
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,640
to propose something that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

1593
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,160
little radical right so in doing

1594
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,359
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this we switched over we</font>

1595
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,170
saw all these bugs all these

1596
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:45,790
misconfigurations to this old address

1597
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:47,440
why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do this every so often and</font>

1598
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:50,710
you says a periodic form of garbage

1599
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,680
collection um so the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this IP</font>

1600
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:56,290
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> change over is a historic event</font>

1601
01:04:52,680 --> 01:05:00,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm I'm unit this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University so i</font>

1602
01:04:56,290 --> 01:05:02,800
can say weird out there things but it

1603
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:05,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">really helped us identify lots of hosts</font>

1604
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:07,210
that just are just introducing this you

1605
01:05:05,590 --> 01:05:11,250
know background radiation on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the</font>

1606
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:13,780
internet and it was a really useful

1607
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:15,840
insight that unfortunately might be the

1608
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:18,430
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we get it because this was</font>

1609
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:21,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost the last root server to switch</font>

1610
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:23,169
over to any<font color="#CCCCCC"> cast um i want to tease a</font>

1611
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:26,410
couple preliminary results we started so

1612
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:28,570
now that d<font color="#E5E5E5"> route has for about a year</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half almost two years now been any</font>

1614
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:34,450
casted i want to tease a couple of our

1615
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:36,400
ongoing questions so with any<font color="#E5E5E5"> cast with</font>

1616
01:05:34,450 --> 01:05:38,649
a couple new students George Peter le

1617
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,570
and Ming shell shell we're asking a

1618
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:42,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">couple extra questions we're curious how</font>

1619
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:45,040
our hosts mapped to these different

1620
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:48,160
anycast instances distributed across the

1621
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:49,960
world um is it optimal in terms of

1622
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:51,940
latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-thought optimal it's at</font>

1623
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:53,230
least good right so if I am I are my

1624
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:54,790
queries going to the other side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1625
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:56,560
world or am I at least going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the one</font>

1626
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:58,630
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for here ideally we're</font>

01:05:56,560 --> 01:06:02,259
hitting the instance that's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> save</font>

1628
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:04,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">dulles um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also interestingly a lot of</font>

1629
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:07,480
times attacks say like amplification

01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:08,890
attacks spoof the<font color="#E5E5E5"> source</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address but if</font>

1631
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,900
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have many different locations</font>

01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:13,870
throughout<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world you don't get a</font>

choice as to which of these different IP

<font color="#E5E5E5">anycast instances you get to go to so if</font>

1635
01:06:15,790 --> 01:06:19,480
we could see higher traffic higher

1636
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:21,549
attack traffic to summit is we might

1637
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,600
actually be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to determine where the</font>

1638
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:25,390
attacks are really coming from

1639
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:27,339
physically so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use one thing</font>

1640
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:29,379
about this optimal this notion of how

1641
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:32,110
good is the latency that that clients

1642
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:34,660
get to their to the instance of d route

1643
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:36,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're routed to so this is one of</font>

1644
01:06:34,660 --> 01:06:38,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the instances in argentina and this is</font>

1645
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:41,828
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> really good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis here</font>

1646
01:06:38,290 --> 01:06:44,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">is amusing distance geographic distance</font>

1647
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:45,849
as a proxy<font color="#CCCCCC"> for latency for the time</font>

1648
01:06:44,619 --> 01:06:47,680
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not exactly the same</font>

1649
01:06:45,849 --> 01:06:50,049
thing geographic distance you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that</font>

1650
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,299
in and of itself ignores water but it's

1651
01:06:50,049 --> 01:06:54,969
a reasonable proxy for the most part to

1652
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:56,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">get a sense of what's going on and so</font>

1653
01:06:54,969 --> 01:07:00,309
ideally what we would see is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

1654
01:06:56,979 --> 01:07:01,959
the distance between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the optimal</font>

1655
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:03,400
instance that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to whichever</font>

1656
01:07:01,959 --> 01:07:05,078
one is closest versus when they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1657
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,609
to should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero they should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be going</font>

1658
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:08,920
to the optimal one so what we'd want is

1659
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:11,920
a straight<font color="#CCCCCC"> line at right at the y axis</font>

1660
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:13,450
and for some hosts we actually see this

1661
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,390
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a hosting our this is any</font>

1662
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:18,069
cast instance in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Argentina the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vast</font>

1663
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:21,190
majority of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the folks you're going to it</font>

1664
01:07:18,069 --> 01:07:23,440
that is the closest one for them so

1665
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:25,660
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dulles again looks quite a bit</font>

1666
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,749
different I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out that</font>

1667
01:07:25,660 --> 01:07:30,328
the x axis goes up to 12,000 kilometers

1668
01:07:28,749 --> 01:07:32,618
so there are some folks who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1669
01:07:30,329 --> 01:07:35,680
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far as they could get to</font>

1670
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:37,599
get to iad so to show like you know well

1671
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:41,348
maybe that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe the best one for</font>

1672
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:45,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">them here's a quick animation of who was</font>

1673

1676
01:07:49,420 --> 01:07:54,339
the geographic coordinates in these

1677
01:07:52,089 --> 01:07:55,449
boxes correspond to or these boxes each

1678

correspond to a different anycast

1679
01:07:55,449 --> 01:08:00,729

01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:12,549
outside of that box isn't going to

1686
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:15,069
dulles there's somebody closer to them

1687
01:08:12,549 --> 01:08:18,880
geographically anyway so here's the

1688
01:08:15,069 --> 01:08:22,658
animation what we see is ied being a

1689
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:25,690
routing centric um area of routing

1690
01:08:22,658 --> 01:08:27,939
centric part of the the network actually

1691
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:29,948
collects a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> data than than are a</font>

1692
01:08:27,939 --> 01:08:31,868
lot more queries than it seems like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1693
01:08:29,948 --> 01:08:35,259
should so to summarize overall our

1694
01:08:31,868 --> 01:08:38,080
anycast analysis is ongoing but it does

1695
01:08:35,259 --> 01:08:40,359
seem as initial results indicate the

1696
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,729
anycast does seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to favor routing</font>

1712
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:27,120
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at the overall</font>

dynamics but in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of digging to the</font>

data let's please talk after<font color="#E5E5E5"> book</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

1715
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:36,870
go that'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be fantastic so Warren kamari</font>

1716
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google um I probably just wasn't paying</font>

1717
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:40,680
attention because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm usually not paying</font>

1718
01:09:38,490 --> 01:09:42,630
attention but can you explain why you

1719
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:46,230
had to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address just cuz</font>

1720
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:48,630
you enabled any cost oh so to support IP

1721
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:51,540
anycast we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce</font>

1722
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:57,360
our prefix d route was hosted inside of

1723
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:59,220
maryland / 16 um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i suppose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe it</font>

1724
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:00,570
could have been fragmented to or we

1725
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:02,340
could have taken this last 24 out of it

1726
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:04,019
I imagine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can had given us this</font>

1727
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">last 24 so there's a decision amongst</font>

1728
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:08,930
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> d-word operators to just use what i</font>

1729
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:08,930
can and provided

1730
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:17,090
all right there might be like a much

1731
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:21,560
deeper reason for that that I don't know

1732
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:23,060
so I don't wanna to clarify i'm not one

1733
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:25,370
of the d-word operators we worked with

1734
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:28,130
them so I I hope I'm not misrepresenting

1735
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:29,990
them hi Patrick<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gilmore marketing group</font>

1736
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:32,000
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you planning to shut off the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> old</font>

1737
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:34,940
address any time and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> minor thing is</font>

1738
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:39,560
that it has been has stopped responding

1739
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:43,969
to queries yeah yeah I but it stayed up

1740
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:47,540
for I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least a year if you have</font>

1741
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:49,760
some ideas that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can relay then I I for</font>

1742
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:53,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">one would love to keep hearing what's</font>

1743
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,130
going on be fun yeah hey I'm offer I'm

1744
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:59,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">suggesting garbage collection at least</font>

1745
01:10:55,130 --> 01:11:01,900
we can do is yeah so Michael from es net

1746
01:10:59,510 --> 01:11:08,300
one of the reasons you're seeing some

1747
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:10,879
perhaps not totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> optimized any cows</font>

1748
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:13,280
routing is that in particularly they are

1749
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:16,400
any networks will tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to favor or any</font>

1750
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:18,590
networks which means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes</font>

1751
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,759
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have local prefs at high you're</font>

1752
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:21,770
going to trump everything else and

1753
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:23,240
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to send your traffic to an</font>

1754
01:11:21,770 --> 01:11:25,310
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> caste name server that's in an are</font>

1755
01:11:23,240 --> 01:11:28,130
any network even if it's in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Japan and</font>

1756
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:29,540
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so that sort of thing happens</font>

1757
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:31,130
quite a bit and we always sort of

1758
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:33,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">struggle to figure out what's the best</font>

1759
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:34,760
way to local / if those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see so</font>

1760
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:36,259
the default way you're seeing you're

1761
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:37,760
probably seeing a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1762
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stuff in the west coast of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the u.s.</font>

1763
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,150
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iad you might actually be</font>

1764
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,560
seeing a lot of internet too and yes

1765
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:45,320
that for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter clients going to do</font>

1766
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:47,270
interesting yeah there is sort of you

1767
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:51,950
know this expectation that you know IP

1768
01:11:47,270 --> 01:11:53,870
anycast will um approximate<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font>

1769
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:55,400
there's this tussle a bit right so

1770
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:56,630
there's there's policies in terms of

1771
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,190
what bgp gets you which it doesn't

1772
01:11:56,630 --> 01:12:00,580
guarantee anything close to shortest

1773
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:03,650
path or should lowest latency right um

1774
01:12:00,580 --> 01:12:04,970
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I panic has kind of to an</font>

1775
01:12:03,650 --> 01:12:06,950
extent realized on and the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

1776
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:09,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">even if it doesn't achieve the optimal</font>

1777
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:11,000
latency it is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the the</font>

1778
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:13,070
resilience which is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the primary I</font>

1779
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,480
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the primary reasons for for</font>

1780
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:16,849
shifting to any cast for for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1781
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:22,629
of critical research I'm sorry

1782
01:12:16,850 --> 01:12:29,480
I don't know sir I know you v6 address

1783
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:35,990

1784
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:39,349
questions right thanks very much sure
