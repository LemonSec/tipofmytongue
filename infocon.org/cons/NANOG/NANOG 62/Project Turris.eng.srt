00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,920
to talk about the special security

indices it via middle-sized registry

8
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,250
with about 1.2 million domains and the

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,930
special feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the registry is a bit</font>

signed by alien sex so the security

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,190
issue we really address very often but

13
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,440
more than registry we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people</font>

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:53,309
and and we do have various projects very

00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:07,710
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing maybe for this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">project off of shared cyber defense and</font>

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,200
we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address three main issue</font>

27
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:25,679
first of all we wanted to do a some

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,850
security research we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> improve</font>

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,219
the area of energy security and also to

30
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:34,169
improve the situation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the home</font>

31
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:37,350
routers those small devices that

32
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,630
everyone have home and you know doesn't

33
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:42,658
touch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but it works for him so the</font>

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:45,570
security research currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do a lot</font>

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">of stuff in security field we we run</font>

36
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:51,570
honeynet we we collect a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of TNS</font>

37
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,090
related data we do many anomaly

38
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:57,360
detection techniques on on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,850
data but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a very little</font>

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,909
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the you know the end</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">uses the network the ends of the those</font>

42
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,300
networks so we wanted to have some more

43
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">data from this field so that we came</font>

44
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:14,100
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a idea to put some probes closer to</font>

45
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,310
the end users and and see what happens

46
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,769
there we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> distribute those</font>

47
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,650
probes to as many networks as possible

48
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:24,870
within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country and we wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to run</font>

49
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,390
the same algorithm views for<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns d I</font>

detection mechanism to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help the end</font>

52
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:38,720
users we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a firewall</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">those data we will collect or we will</font>

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,890
collect from the other parties and one

56
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,260
of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be the the national cert</font>

57
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,390
team so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy which is also run run</font>

58
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,489
by us actually and and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> team has</font>

59
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:55,040
cooperation did many other agencies

60
00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:57,470
collecting very a lot of information

61
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some security or some compromise</font>

62
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:04,489
devices and the third issue the harm

63
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,739
router so her out us you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

64
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:08,570
all of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this situation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

65
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:12,040
know they are they are they usually

66
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:15,799
don't have good if any support of ipv6

67
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,670
they have many problems with DNS DNS SEC

68
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:23,030
they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> I haven't heard about any</font>

69
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:25,160
performing DNS SEC validation if you if

70
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,110
you buy it the only thing you can just

71
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,519
switch it on configure its but you

72
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,100
cannot do anything else<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't</font>

73
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,239
usually legally access it so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no</font>

74
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:37,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">support for any other application those</font>

75
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:41,900
devices have just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> limited set of</font>

76
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:43,790
security features again if any and one

77
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,030
big issue there is not an easy way<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

78
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,920
hope to upgrade them those<font color="#CCCCCC"> producers</font>

79
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,040
manufacturers mainly in Southeast Asia

80
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:54,890
they just ship it to to Europe us and

81
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,920
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> later its salt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cell to the</font>

82
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:01,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">end users and the firmware is one year</font>

83
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:05,510
old with mini box there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is usually none</font>

84
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,220
newer updated firmware and if exists you

85
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,410
know those those people who who got

86
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,739
those boxes<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not able to to upgrade</font>

87
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:14,120
it to sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very frustrating</font>

88
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,840
there is a lot of bugs in those devices

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,560
and and currently some of the botnets

90
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,750
uses use those devices so and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

91
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,820
are not aware of it so they just forget

92
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:29,030
it's it's a normal<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer running in</font>

93
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:33,490
your home 24 hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and it may it may</font>

94
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,489
do a lot of itself so

95
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,130
yeah so back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data collection so</font>

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,160
we set a goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have about 1000 of of</font>

97
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:47,570
those boxes we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,700
free to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people from for tax purposes</font>

99
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:54,240
it's official<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least for three years</font>

100
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the price is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five us give a sense of</font>

101
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,600
really just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a symbolic price and we try</font>

102
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,930
to find a some hardware that would be

103
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,340
you know without mechanical parts nice

104
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,050
enough that you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

105
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,650
home router but<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other hand</font>

106
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:14,220
powerful enough to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forward about 1</font>

107
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:16,530
gigabit of traffic and in meantime doing

108
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,450
some security analyzes so we couldn't

109
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,349
find any hardware on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> market so we</font>

110
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:24,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided to develop our own and that's</font>

111
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:28,470
how the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware development and part</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

112
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,750
the research study also when we are

113
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,730
doing such a hardware quite powerful we

114
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,680
wanted to this harder to have some

115
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:36,960
additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> features to increase the</font>

116
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,960
volume for end users so it should have a

117
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,770
lot of ports and possibility to run as a

118
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,479
print server NASA and stuff like that so

119
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:47,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's how the road to Taurus was</font>

120
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,340
developed we start development<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

121
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,859
scratch and and this is the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final of</font>

122
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,500
it so it looks like this it's a aluminum

123
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,120
blue box which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is given to</font>

124
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,970
people look like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal hammer out</font>

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,500
right but inside the heart is is

126
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,680
freescale by point<font color="#CCCCCC"> two gigahertz</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">gigabyte of flash memory which is used</font>

132
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,950
as a backup backup system in case

133
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:22,230
anything fails it has five<font color="#E5E5E5"> LAN port</font>

134
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,440
Gigabit LAN port which has connected

143
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:51,840
it's just a cart inside it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has two USB</font>

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">know pin hundreds many internal</font>

146
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,739
interfaces so it's quite flexible if you

147
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so some Europe</font>

149
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,719
for for whatever purposes so quite

150
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,270
flexible if you want to play with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

151
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,280
we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> included one micro sdhc slot so</font>

152
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,320
you can you can put another flash memory

153
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,030
if you wish we thought it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

154
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,640
helpful but but at the end of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Navy</font>

155
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:22,739
we couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find any usage for it but</font>

156
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,640
some people use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a as a storage so</font>

157
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:29,490
it's free if you want to use it although

158
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:31,349
it's quite powerful and its really

159
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,050
capable forwarding more than gigabit of

160
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,090
traffic it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have high power</font>

161
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,130
consumption so you don't have to be

162
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:42,659
afraid if you switch it on in your home

163
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:44,940
it varies on the load and how much Wi-Fi

164
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,610
is using stuff like that from nine to 14

165
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:50,910
watts and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can use sir</font>

166
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,890
you can use also the USB to power<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font>

167
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,260
other devices so then in that case the

168
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:58,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumption increases but it's of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

169
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,620
your option and it's the whole thing is

170
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,810
is licensed<font color="#E5E5E5"> under open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> source so so all</font>

171
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,300
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans how to manufacture is out on</font>

172
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the website</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to make</font>

00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:13,710
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own devices feel free to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so</font>

174
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,960
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it as I said and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see</font>

175
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,080
inside nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> surprises but nothing</font>

176
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,669
mechanical no no fan nothing like that

177
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,560
it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> one killer feature something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

178
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:27,420
really people lost love<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

179
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,760
maybe you saw that problem if you have

180
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:31,650
some device with very with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> lets</font>

181
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,330
that it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> very convenient if it's</font>

182
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:36,270
switch on in a room where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also sleep</font>

183
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:38,370
which some people have the problems so

184
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,530
that's why there is a button at the back

185
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,299
which which can dim all those lights and

186
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,010
that's a feature beloved by many

187
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,990
students running this device in

188
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:52,300
they're in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sleeping room</font>

189
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,400
those those lights are really software

190
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:57,880
manageable so many people use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

191
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,709
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> purposes I don't know if you if</font>

192
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,890
you if you remember the<font color="#CCCCCC"> David hassle of</font>

00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">movies us with Knight Rider smart card</font>

194
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,720
so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use the same feature you</font>

195
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,670
know flashing from left to right and

196
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,310
back with the with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tories</font>

197
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,069
lights as well so people will like to

198
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:16,660
play with that so a little bit about

199
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,020
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ATS linux-based</font>

200
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,630
distribution open wrt we that's not

201
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">developed from scratch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we use a lot of</font>

202
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:27,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that was done there however</font>

203
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,439
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> added some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other features we waited</font>

204
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,950
our own configuration bizarre because

205
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,290
open wrt is perfect for geeks but if you

206
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:39,040
distribute those those routers to normal

207
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:41,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that are not a verb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of network</font>

208
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,300
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make something very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple</font>

209
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:46,840
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so we develop our own</font>

210
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:49,900
configuration bizarre and also edit a

<font color="#E5E5E5">net con flyer to trace so these bizarre</font>

212
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:55,930
uses that layer but also this<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer can</font>

213
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:59,069
be done by some other other applications

214
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,780
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's the way how many</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">teresa's can be configured automatically</font>

216
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:08,110
using that conf interface something

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:12,780
that's very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us it's it's</font>

218
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:14,820
able to be outta matically updated so

219
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,910
you know if there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> some security</font>

220

problems all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tourists are updated</font>

221
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:23,699
but in case there is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the update</font>

222
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">requires reboot you can for example set</font>

223
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,740
up the trees for example if there is a

224
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,050
need for reboot please informing by

225
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,080
email and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do not react in seven</font>

226
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,640
days rebooted in n3 a.m. for example

227
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,190
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way how do people set it up</font>

228
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,290
to so the reboots doesn't you know break

229
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,900
any operations that you need in your

232
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,500
some key material so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way how</font>

233
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:54,660
it's up means the the data to s there is

234
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,490
one process called that collects the

235
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,980
data there's the only mandatory process

236
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:00,750
if you join this project otherwise you

237
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:03,870
know device is open you can you can

238
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:08,280
access it and modify however you want

239
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:11,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have also an Andrew application</font>

240
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:13,560
that can that can manage this device so

241
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,930
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to login into your</font>

242
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,359
computer to look what's what's going on

243
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,459
in this device this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the</font>

244
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,980
results look like this is an example of

00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:47,130
a pluggable system for for data analysis

252
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,720
it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know pick up</font>

253
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,460
module or something like that it's a

heart of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> active security monitoring</font>

255
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,820
system we also collect all the fiber

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,690
locks so if any unsuccessful attempts to

257
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:03,840
connect to the router we we look at the

258
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:06,300
router log so upgrade status some

259
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,820
software problems we also collect some

260
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,920
other data like temperature load memory

261
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,960
and flash utilization you know this is

262
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">our first hardware at them so we wanted</font>

263
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be sure that those devices are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

264
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:20,640
they are not too hot and so on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

265
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,290
collect all those data and they are sent

currently about six medals frizzes

271
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:38,040
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> end user it counts how many</font>

272
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,800
packets and which protocol family in

273
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,949
which which kind you know when were

274
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,620
forwarded through the device and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

276
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,309
the important one is buckets that's the

277
00:12:50,189 --> 00:12:56,399
module that that does the IP anomaly

278
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:58,589
detection so basically the device looks

279
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,180
at the normal data traffic flow and if

280
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:05,069
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something suspicious it's make</font>

281
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:08,128
just an imprint of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic's and</font>

282
00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:10,469
it send it to to us its interests a hash

283
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:12,329
imprint of it and if you collect more

284
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,990
such hashes we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is something</font>

285
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:17,248
<font color="#CCCCCC">suspicious and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we ask the devices to</font>

286
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:18,959
identify a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more what the</font>

287
00:13:17,249 --> 00:13:21,149

288
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:24,149
we how we do the anomaly detection

289
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:26,430
analyzes there is also something again

290

as a service for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users perfect</font>

passive network speed monitor bandwidth

292
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:35,040
so so you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> how much you pay OSP</font>

293
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:38,189
and how much actually you did get there

294
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,920
is also a net flow like data collector

295
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:43,498
which is you specifically for for some

296
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,009

center of some botnets or something like

298
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:52,529
that so these networks use a specific

looks at the ssl certificates of those

<font color="#E5E5E5">just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be sure that there is nothing</font>

use it for some research purposes we

is like<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number of clients that were</font>

359
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,809
like that we also include some data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

360
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,809
the honey net and from those data we

00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:10,149
collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the we make it the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grey list</font>

which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again used for the net flow</font>

363
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,260
analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> later on so if you see some</font>

364
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:16,660
strong attacker we create a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray least</font>

00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,939
informed in de turistas to descend as

366
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,470
the flow data and we can explore a

367
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:25,000
little bit more what's this attack about

368
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:27,939
which helped us to find some some

369
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,950
misconfigured devices like some people

370
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:31,960
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> tourists is open they can play with</font>

371
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">it so either tories or some device</font>

372
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,370
behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> them was open to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gina's</font>

373
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:39,309
refraction attacks we found some samba

374
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:41,649
that's suspicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> samba communication</font>

375
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:44,080
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entities network to some</font>

376
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chinese side so it's probably somatic so</font>

377
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,860
again trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help the DN Jesus to fix</font>

378
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:53,290
the problems in their local networks and

379
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,570
and one more thing we are working on is

380
00:17:53,290 --> 00:18:00,550
we are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find a patterns of</font>

381
00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:02,830
similar attack behaviors so if some if

382
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:05,110
some IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> address is you know it takes</font>

383
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:07,659
many many devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a mother does the</font>

384
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:09,760
same is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same pattern that's probably</font>

385
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:14,410
either the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same virus or the same group</font>

386
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:18,070
of device is trying to attack something

387
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:20,110
so we we use some techniques<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for</font>

388
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:24,309
text mining to find some similar things

389
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:26,889
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those in those behaviors and again we</font>

390
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:29,200
collect some list of IP addresses that

391
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,570
probably are affected by the same virus

392
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,580
are we for example fine and network

393
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,899
which which does the same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack</font>

394
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,800
so it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> virus but</font>

395
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:42,190
probably somebody using some<font color="#E5E5E5"> farm of</font>

396
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:46,500
servers to attacking the internet and

397
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:48,820
again we we cooperate with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national</font>

398
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,910
cybersecurity team suits you set which

399
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:55,240
is again part of our company so

400
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:58,630
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting data from them and those</font>

401
00:18:55,240 --> 00:19:02,080
data comes from other security teams or

402
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:07,930
some simply companies that are like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

403
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:10,120
are providing those data and we also use

404
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,060
those data for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> some firewall use</font>

405
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:17,639
under on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Teresa so so the tourists</font>

406
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:21,399
can block some certain iframe so certain

407
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:24,790
certain web pages<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infected and</font>

408
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:27,460
stuff like that many many of sites were

409
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:29,590
blocked already and we also provide some

410
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,550
data in case of some some interesting

411
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:34,300
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you are familiar</font>

412
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:36,220
with the synology problem but when this

413
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,620
this problem appeared we provided some

414
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:42,730
data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> synology to help to understand</font>

415
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:46,030
what was going on something we it's in

416
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:47,410
progress we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are working on a module that</font>

417
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:51,629
will help the people understand what

418
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:54,820
other devices in his<font color="#E5E5E5"> local area doing</font>

419
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:58,480
you know accounting data and providing

420
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:59,980
list of what devices they communicate

421
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,390
ways and stuff like that that's not

422
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,080
something that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be collected by us</font>

423
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:08,110
that's just a service<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the end users</font>

424
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:10,060
there were several tvs that you know

425
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">smart TVs that are communicating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

426
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,919
the manufacturers and and sending

427
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:17,470

know stuff like that people play with it

467
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:07,129

it's leasing for three years and after

473
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:27,720
three years you can buy the device again

474
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:30,300
for five<font color="#E5E5E5"> us cents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so for nothing mainly</font>

475
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,190
we have several conditions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

478
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,240
we wouldn't call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most interesting</font>

off at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very often now on the</font>

484

open access so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you can ssh to</font>

485
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:58,080
the device completely change it the

data collection stuff of course

489
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:09,019
probably you might think of the privacy

490
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you collect a lot of data from</font>

491
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:14,629
the end users so we started really very

492
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:16,519
carefully we<font color="#E5E5E5"> firstly consulted this this</font>

495
00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:29,059
when we prepare the<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreement we send it</font>

496
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:30,739
to the community and ask for feedback so

497
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:33,889
we get a lot of fee by we modify the

498
00:23:30,739 --> 00:23:36,409
contract everything we do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> open source</font>

499
00:23:33,889 --> 00:23:39,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">so everybody can verify</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what would</font>

500
00:23:36,409 --> 00:23:41,809
we declare we do you really do so that's

501
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:45,200
that was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why we got</font>

502
00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:48,590
a positive Big Brother<font color="#E5E5E5"> vote in 2013 and</font>

private data collection can be done

505
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:56,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">correctly so some interesting facts it's</font>

506
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:59,918
roughly a thousand devices online

transferable 64 bytes of data every day

508
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:06,859
small percentage is ipv6 we register

511
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:16,399
probably some attackers and now we we

512
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:20,059
did some six major releases of the

513
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:22,850
operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> system without breaking any</font>

514
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:25,850
device which is great and and several

515
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:28,340
minor releases for example when the

516
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:30,559
heartbeat attack appeared we we were

517
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,749
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix it in a few days the same</font>

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the shock shell shock and stuff</font>

519
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:37,399
like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are real trying to be</font>

interesting too

535
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:19,500
you have to be able to use some data

536
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:21,919
about the traffic so so they can measure

537

so they can measure that you know

currently discussing some the future we

542
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,140
decided to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new version 1.1 new</font>

00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:42,690
hardware version of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> touareg stories</font>

544
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:44,880
router it's basically the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we</font>

545
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:49,559
did some minor other improvements like

546
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,769
USB 30 slot interface and also sim card

547
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:56,850
slot so it can be easily used for some

LTE router we would like to manufacture

549
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:01,590

550
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:06,809
it's just the extension of the current

00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:02,669
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> project but on the other hand</font>

570
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,620
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some harder team some very good</font>

571
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:07,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience how to make those devices and</font>

572
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:10,168
also the software i think is unique so

573
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:12,059
we decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a new project for</font>

574
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:15,510
next year so it's it's it's a future

575
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:17,760
project not ready yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we would like</font>

576
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:22,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make another version of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to race which</font>

577
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,340
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tory slide and it</font>

578
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,678
should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some educational board</font>

579
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,790
something like raspberry pi but but in

580
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,490
networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> verte in</font>

581
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:32,820
with a lot of ethernet interfaces and

582
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:35,460
other interfaces and lacking for example

583
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:38,460
hdmi interface but something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be</font>

584
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">used by network people for playing</font>

585
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:45,690
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever it should be a little</font>

586
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,640
bit a little bit less powerful and then

587
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:52,500
the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tories but still able to</font>

588
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:55,500
provide one gigabit of traffic and we

589
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:59,070
would like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use some kickstart</font>

590
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:01,980
model of crowd sourcing to finance this

591
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:07,020
project so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old target is to make</font>

592
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:10,560
BOTS in price roughly 100 doors and we

593
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,030
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect you to you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

594
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">money for the development we just need</font>

595
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,020
to cover the variable to cost so which

596
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,480
means mainly really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> manufacturer of</font>

597
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the board is a not-for-profit project</font>

598
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,520
isn't something for sale we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

599
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">any profits from that but that's to</font>

600
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,530
address people that came to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and said</font>

601
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:30,990
please make a hundreds of boxes to me

602
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:32,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm happy to pay and we say well we</font>

603
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,250
cannot get it to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we need to</font>

604
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,110
dis for this project and and honestly

605
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:39,990
the price of this this box is quite high

606
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:42,090
I know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,000 pieces manufactured in</font>

607
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:44,400
European Union so it doesn't make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense</font>

608
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:45,990
to for commercial market but this trace

609
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,780
life would be enlarged evil<font color="#CCCCCC"> women and</font>

610
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:51,930
maybe it would find<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody some people</font>

611
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:54,149
to play with<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see so I think I made</font>

ready thank you very much

620
00:29:14,479 --> 00:29:19,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">do we do have time for a question or two</font>

621
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:22,559
dan is that you yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how's it going</font>

622
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:24,478
<font color="#E5E5E5">man dama Gorean Hopkins Applied Physics</font>

623
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,849
lab so did<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about using</font>

624
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:30,389
raspberry pi type standard off-the-shelf

625
00:29:26,849 --> 00:29:32,999
devices to begin with or with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> too low</font>

626
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:35,039
power or didn't have gigabit wired or

627
00:29:32,999 --> 00:29:36,449
those kind of things I mean I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

628
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,879
was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out why you you</font>

629
00:29:36,449 --> 00:29:41,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">went the customer out i'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

630
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:43,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">sewing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what why you built custom</font>

631
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:45,029
hardware as opposed to basing and on

632
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:47,819
something like raspberry probably oh

633
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:49,319
yeah have you seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raspberry Pi</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

634
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,329
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good device I like it but the</font>

635
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,399
problem is the networking part is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

636
00:29:51,329 --> 00:29:55,739
poor<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's it's USB connected</font>

637
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,218
ethernet port so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing you can</font>

638
00:29:55,739 --> 00:30:01,379
use seriously if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make a</font>

639
00:29:58,219 --> 00:30:04,019
network device so that's why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> decided</font>

640
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:07,069
to make something different raspberry

641
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:11,669
pis is excellent if you want to do your

642
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:13,379
home d via a DVD player<font color="#E5E5E5"> mp3 player or</font>

643
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:17,399
something like that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very strong in</font>

644
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:20,069
multimedia but it has very poor feature

645
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:22,408
so I ability in internet working world

646
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:23,969
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's better ones out these days they</font>

647
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:29,069
have gigabit connectivity and all that

648
00:30:23,969 --> 00:30:32,539
but they are pretty reason this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

649
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:32,539
christian<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm so</font>

650
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:39,330
start

651
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,330
any other questions

652
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,879
okay thanks hungry thank you
