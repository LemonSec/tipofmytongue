00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:13,580
sick<font color="#CCCCCC"> of me yet wow this this one is not</font>

2
00:00:11,959 --> 00:00:15,889
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> my presentation but i'm giving</font>

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,610
it on behalf of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andre Roberts have ski</font>

00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:22,009
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sock I believe that he presented</font>

00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the past about the routing resilience</font>

6
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:26,960
manifesto and sort of this is an update

7
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:28,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">on where that is right now on what's</font>

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,320
going on one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things you'll see</font>

9
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,790
actually I should go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,200
we changed the name because some folks

11
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:37,670
thought that manifesto sounded a little

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,410
too sketchy so we came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cute</font>

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:45,190
acronym and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> now it's called manners</font>

14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:48,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">um the idea here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a collective</font>

15
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,879
focus on a set of things that we all

16
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,859
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of agree or the right things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

17
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:53,210
to improve routing security this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font>

18
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:55,879
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> harkening back to what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had said</font>

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:59,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">before about there's a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of things</font>

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,980
that we can do before rpki is ready that

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,780
will help to improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing security in</font>

22
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,970
meaningful ways these are the the high

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,770
points you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly look at this in</font>

24
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,539
more detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the on the slides but I'm</font>

25
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,179
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of time reading</font>

26
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,980
bullets to you the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is</font>

27
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,800
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to try and get to a</font>

28
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical mass of providers who agree</font>

29
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,770
that these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things to do</font>

30
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:25,850
and that they agreed it if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

31
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,410
already implementing them in their

32
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:31,339
network that they will implement them

33
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:33,830
and also continue having an open set of

34
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:36,800
discussions around ways that we can

35
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:37,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to improve things new new</font>

36
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,560
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we all need to do</font>

37
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:42,320
collectively in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve routing</font>

38
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,330
routing security and general security on

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,330
the internet but the high points here

40
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:50,090
are in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP filtering anti</font>

41
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:52,220
spoofing and collaboration and

42
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:54,850
coordination so having right contact

43
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,810
information available things like that

44
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,399
mostly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking about here is</font>

45
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,030
the things that we care about in terms

46
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:03,560
of what the there are references already

47
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,450
in the document<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point out the house</font>

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,440
so that there is another place for folks

49
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,959
to go this wasn't meant to be a

50
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,940
prescriptive document they're still

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,530
certainly openings for if people have

52
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,269
good resources that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not pointing to</font>

53
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,769
we certainly would welcome that feedback

54
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:19,790
these are the general principles that

55
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:21,769
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about</font>

56
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,980
and you can see here that this is this

57
00:02:21,769 --> 00:02:28,329
is pretty high level at the in terms of

58
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:31,518
what what we think is important here

59
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:32,750
this is in a little lower level thing

60
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,120
what we're talking about is actually

61
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:36,439
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid spoofing trying to avoid</font>

62
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,790
propagating and correct routing

63
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,280
information in whatever form that might

64
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,010
take and that is purposely not

65
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:46,939
prescriptin prescribing either rpki or

66
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,260
other solutions and trying to improve

67
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,030
the communication on this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing</font>

68
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,099
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can coordinate better the</font>

69
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:54,409
idea is if we can come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

70
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:56,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that are that are wasted meaning</font>

71
00:02:54,409 --> 00:03:00,019
meaningfully<font color="#CCCCCC"> improved what we're doing</font>

72
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,909
to secure the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as a community it</font>

73
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">pertains continues to perpetuate the</font>

74
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:04,760
idea that we're good at self-governance

75
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:07,010
and fixing problems on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own rather</font>

76
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,599
than having something blow up in such a

77
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,899
way that end up we end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font>

78
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:13,518
of regulators stepping in to help these

79
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,829
are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> more specific information about</font>

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the actions that we're actually agreeing</font>

81
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,879
to hear the idea here is that you want

82
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have a group of providers that are</font>

83
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,659
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that either they will do</font>

84
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,040
these actions or they're already doing

85
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:26,810
them and so this goes through and talks

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,858
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individual actions in a little</font>

87
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:34,780
more detail and again<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can read these</font>

88
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:34,780
as you see fit

89
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,239
um and then the main thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> really here</font>

90
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:48,280
is to actually hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website the</font>

91
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,780
current fight what we believe to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

92
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,120
final draft form of the document is out

93
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:54,730
there we're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to go public</font>

94
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,840
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and so if there are things</font>

95
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:57,730
that people see that are that are

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,010
glaringly wrong please give us feedback

97
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,950
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as possible it's still at</font>

98
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,760

99
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,310
whether they're going to be changing

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that domain eventually but this is the</font>

101
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:12,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">the document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can look at it in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

102
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:14,290
much detail as you want here's sort of

103
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:17,589
where we are we've got a draft document

104
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:19,089
we've since<font color="#CCCCCC"> andre's last discussion and</font>

105
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:21,359
post to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of different mailing</font>

106
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:23,169
lists we've had a lot of internal

107
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,520
discussion we've gotten lots of feedback

108
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:25,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">from folks who've looked this and said</font>

109
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,780
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this wrong or this these</font>

110
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,948
words don't make sense or whatever and

111
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,880
we've incorporated a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feedback we</font>

112
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,669
think we've got something that's pretty

113
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">close and we're pretty happy with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

114
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:37,448
we're getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> ready for sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

115
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be the the real launch so that's</font>

116
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:42,340
that's kind of where we are we are

117
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,229
looking for participants this covers

118
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:45,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually mean by participating</font>

119
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,680
the idea is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up with</font>

120
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,960
something kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of similar to what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

121
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,160
for things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> World v6 launch where</font>

122
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,919
you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of companies that say</font>

123
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,970
we we commit to participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this the</font>

124
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,130
difference here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there</font>

125
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:58,840
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> different categories</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of things</font>

126
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,400
involved here not everyone's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

127
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">everything right away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or even agree that</font>

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,060
everything is the right thing to do

129
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,948
there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> checkboxes so</font>

130
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can say for example my company can</font>

131
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:10,870
do x and y but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Z and we can still</font>

132
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,010
accommodate that so that was the idea in

133
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,520
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this as flexible as</font>

134
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,919
possible so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your check boxes you</font>

135
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,020
can kind of choose out what makes the

136
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">most sense for you but this was just</font>

137
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,530
intended to try and raise the visibility

138
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,849
on this make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are looking at</font>

139
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,590
this and seeing if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something they</font>

140
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:28,240
can participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in because we think the</font>

141
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,929
real benefit of this is getting enough

142
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,490
participants so that there's added

143
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,190
pressure to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get more and more folks</font>

144
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:38,590
involved this is this absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

145
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:40,330
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the main benefit is</font>

146
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,679
when more and more<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are doing it</font>

147
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,289
consistently especially when it comes to

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,080
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP filtering and anti</font>

149
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,370
spoofing and so getting more and more

150
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,050
participants who are then in turn

151
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,460
applying pressure to the folks that

152
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:53,320
there that are under their sphere of

153
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,630
influence their up streams or there

154
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,010
their downstream customers to ensure

155
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gets deployed more widely I</font>

156
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:01,030
think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's sort of the right</font>

157
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:04,450
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of method to improve the</font>

158
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:06,489
propagation of these sorts of things so

159
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:09,940
there's the website again please have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

161
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,830
number of different folks who have been

162
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:17,380
involved in this myself Jared mock Tony

your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind as you feel appropriate but I</font>

166
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:34,690
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it yeah so short and sweet</font>

167
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:43,120
questions thanks Wes any questions all

168
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:45,670
right all right thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you our next</font>

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">contestant is hang on a second there's a</font>

00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">question back there Tony</font>

171
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:00,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">no okay just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an amplification yes we're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not looking just for feedback but to see</font>

173
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,190
if your organization company or what

174
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,010
have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know your operation can</font>

175
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:10,700
become a you know an endorser signatory

176
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:14,130
because the idea is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more momentum</font>

177
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:16,260
more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who say yes we are also</font>

178
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:21,500
doing this and and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

179
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:25,909
right way to do things so that's it and

<font color="#CCCCCC">craig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hankins that's the wrong deck</font>

much better so this is a Jeff<font color="#E5E5E5"> Osborne</font>

182
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:39,560
the president of ISC with an extremely

00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">long slide deck asking the question how</font>

184
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,410
the hell should be fun open<font color="#E5E5E5"> source he's</font>

185
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:49,820
lying about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card deck it's a one</font>

186
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:51,080
slide and it disappeared kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to</font>

187
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,719
keep it up more memory on that machine

188
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,840
at hub I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stick with the</font>

189
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">theory of making up time is good too if</font>

190
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,859
I can keep this 25 minutes like the

191
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,640
leader there will be back on schedule

192
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,200
which I assumes a good thing I basically

193
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,450
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time and talk about</font>

194
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,130
open source which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of like</font>

195
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,020
something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font>

196
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,290
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that much unless it</font>

197
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,770
isn't working open source got hit with a

198
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:20,330
spotlight back in the spring when the

199
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,700
heartbleed vulnerability sort of got

200
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,070
into the popular media and I'm sure all

201
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,890
of us had a lot of time answering

202
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,450
questions from ill-informed but

203
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,219
well-meaning family members and friends

204
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:33,348
about what was this and why did people

205
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,360
make the bad bug and why are bad people

206
00:08:33,349 --> 00:08:37,610
bad and things like that rather than a

207
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,630
bunch of well informed but underfunded

208
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:45,860
people had a vulnerability get exposed

209
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,689
and so you're left wondering how come a

210
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,300
half dozen guys who didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

211
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,220
thousand dollars a year in funding could

212
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,760
possibly stay on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a complex piece</font>

213
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:57,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">of code like openssl something is widely</font>

214
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,569
distributed as that and how come things

215
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,640
like this one don't happen more often

216
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">into why can't we prevent them with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

217
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:07,220
the application of money and a little

218
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:10,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">help so again how are we going to pay</font>

219
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,690
for open source software the bourne

220
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,720
shell vulnerability that we're all

221
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:17,300
playing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with now shell shock or bash or</font>

222
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,370
whatever is just another example of

223
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,620
here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> open-source thing that we're</font>

224
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:24,470
all using and people<font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't really</font>

225
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,680
paying for in the normal sense and yet

226
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,170
we're all exposed to it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

227
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,969
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Germany in question and I have nothing</font>

in the way of proposals or answers I'm

229

just trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise the question in the</font>

three<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes and 45 seconds I have left</font>

the commercial internet business for was

just adding this up it's terrifying over

246
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:19,749
three decades doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> x.25 pads in 1983</font>

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> nonprofit stuff is hard so I've been</font>

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing this for a year and trying to</font>

figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how the hell you make it work</font>

251
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:32,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hartley pointed out the funding</font>

252
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:34,329
difficulties and in trying to help those

253
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,769
guys I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just found it was more</font>

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,299
and more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a rat hole the farther you</font>

255
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:41,439
look how do you how do you pay for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

256
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:43,989
stuff so a couple of decades<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago Red Hat</font>

257
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:46,748
was sort of the first commercial

258
00:10:43,989 --> 00:10:49,149
organized group to try to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how</font>

259
00:10:46,749 --> 00:10:50,799
we pay for things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they provided this</font>

260
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:53,100
is the condensed readers condensed

261
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:56,489
version support services<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a fee and</font>

262
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:59,259
that's worked pretty well for them and

263
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,509
that's a fine thing but it makes it seem

264
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,649
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an easy problem to fix the</font>

265
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:05,319
problem I think is if you take

266
00:11:02,649 --> 00:11:07,359
organizations like that and sort of you

267
00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:09,639
know plot them and you take the the

268
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:11,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">x-axis and take the amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

269
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,029
these people have and then sort in

270
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,799
descending order by how much money

271
00:11:13,029 --> 00:11:16,989
everybody has you get this asymptotic

272
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,669
drop-off in this big long skinny tail

273
00:11:16,989 --> 00:11:20,980
and almost everybody lives in a place

274
00:11:18,669 --> 00:11:25,329
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> no money and no clue how to get it</font>

275
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:27,039
and under fund it and that's not optimal

276
00:11:25,329 --> 00:11:28,929
so somehow<font color="#E5E5E5"> something has to happen</font>

277
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,369
that's better and again I'm raising the

278
00:11:28,929 --> 00:11:32,350
question I really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an answer</font>

279
00:11:30,369 --> 00:11:33,909
when I started talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

280
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">yesterday people started saying the</font>

281
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:37,749
freemium model make a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sense</font>

282
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,399
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a free offering everybody gets</font>

283
00:11:37,749 --> 00:11:43,059
and for a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money you get a</font>

284
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,029
better one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's got its problems</font>

285
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:47,949
too i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's frankly ethically</font>

286
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:49,989
inexcusable to have the shitty software

287
00:11:47,949 --> 00:11:52,659
go to everybody and you get the good

288
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:53,470
stuff if you paid up and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not why</font>

289
00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:54,790
I

290
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,290
got involved in the internet that's not

291
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:02,800
why I run a non-profit that's not why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

292
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:04,870
wake up in the morning so no thank you i

293
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">appreciate that that's that's a lonely</font>

294
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,010
fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> some days and in full disclosure i</font>

295
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,439
inherited some legacy subscription

296
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,780
branch things that we're actively in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

297
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,720
process of closing out because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

298
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,540
it's not right it's not the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing</font>

299
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:21,820
the co-operative fundraising is another

300
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:23,469
pleasant thought and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i checked out</font>

301

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the hotel an hour ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i got the 10</font>

302
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,280
t-shirts we'd cooperatively fought in a

303
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,610
box so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i may grow them in the audience</font>

304
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:33,790
where NL matlab's does a version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

305
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,340
dns product and we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns product</font>

you may have heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> called behind and</font>

307
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:39,610
so i decided i went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sales and</font>

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">marketing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i said we're going to</font>

309
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,290
treat any money that<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into either</font>

310
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these organizations as you having</font>

311
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,579
done a good job and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

312
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">that a bigger umbrella because as an</font>

313
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> source organization the problem is</font>

314
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,880
that fund me the problem is fund open

315
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,880
source we have a three orders of

316
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,100
magnitude problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I argue I've got at</font>

317
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,720
least a quarter million users of mind

318
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,790
and I have a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and twenty who pay</font>

319
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,680
for it so that's three orders of

320
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,980
magnitude and you're still only<font color="#CCCCCC"> halfway</font>

321
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">to solving the problem so obviously the</font>

322
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:13,480
people who are not paying for open

323
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:17,229
source are a much bigger field than the

324
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:19,060
ones paying not paying enough or god

325
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:21,100
forbid I try competing against<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

326
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,040
really well meaning other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people so</font>

327
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,690
that's another thought the last thought

328
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,730
we came up with was my favorite<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the</font>

329
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">council didn't like it gun running and</font>

00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,710
extortion have run really well for Isis

331
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:34,770
I thought we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a open source bmf</font>

332
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:38,470
in about a month if we pulled it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off but</font>

333
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:40,720
council won't let me do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it yet anyway I</font>

334
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:42,340
we're back on schedule now thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

336
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,420
