00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright yeah glad to be here glad to</font>

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:18,820
pull the talk

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:21,790
afternoon before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I start I wanted to</font>

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,250
settle a bar bet this is why I love<font color="#E5E5E5"> nano</font>

5
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:25,419
that's why I love being back at nano so

6
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,020
we had a discussion in the hallway

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:31,180
earlier over coffee about something that

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody outside this conference probably</font>

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:38,590
in the world would ever care about which

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,100
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 32-bit AAS numbers and which one of</font>

11
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,600
them in the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the best connected</font>

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,880
right that seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like an interesting</font>

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
question and when what region would you

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,570
think it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in lady Russia South</font>

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,750
America somebody said Middle East

16
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,969
guesses no<font color="#E5E5E5"> it got kind of violent I mean</font>

17
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:00,100
we were we were putting down money and

18
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:01,120
which one<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was going to be so I just</font>

19
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,340
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to settle that before I get</font>

20
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,830
started we looked it up and the the

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:14,110
best-connected 32-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s on earth at</font>

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,740
incredible peering at the PTT s so

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,330
congratulations<font color="#CCCCCC"> intern exa who is here</font>

27
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,689
on to my topic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was like a lightning</font>

28
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,798
talk on the side of a lightning<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

29
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:33,039
today I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to talk to you</font>

30
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,790
about the 512k moment which we all felt

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:42,009
briefly as a disturbance<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the force</font>

32
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:43,750
back on 12th august and if you remember

33
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:47,110
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is about up and to the</font>

34
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:51,520
right so here's the classic plot this is

35
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:53,049
actually a display of what we at Renesys

36
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,000
now dine research considered to be the

37
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:57,790
consensus routing table size over the

38
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,590
years you can you can't read the scale

39
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:04,899
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left so I provided the magic 512k</font>

40
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,450
for you and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the red</font>

41
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:09,639
line is our consensus estimate that is

42
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,680
if you rounded all of our hundreds of

43
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,078
peers off to the nearest thousand you

44
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,660
force them to guess a table size you

45
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:19,000
said to the nearest thousand what has

46
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,060
the most votes that's what the red line

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,760
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the blue lines represent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

48
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,590
plausible guesses which can be

49
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,130
significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher this thing tends to</font>

50
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,890
trend

51
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,840
above consensus because people tend to

52
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,179
send you all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their personal favorite</font>

53
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,250
routes customer routes and so forth in

54
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:40,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to what we think of as sort of</font>

portable global real full table so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

56
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">can watch this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing growing through the</font>

57
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,970
years we've all been watching this for

58
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,560
years and it kind of ticks up the

59
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">amazing thing about it really is the</font>

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,350
regularity with which it ticks up so

61
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,290
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing has been ticking up at 30 33</font>

62
00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:00,010
32 k a year we start getting towards the

63
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,540
exhaustion panic for ipv4 and maybe

64
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,179
that's it maybe not but it starts to

65
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:08,859
accelerate a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 k additional</font>

66
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:11,920
routes per year in 12 and 13 40 40 k

67
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,590
more 471 at the start of this year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

68
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,119
it's ticking on up and so we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

69
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,700
because we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this exercise</font>

70
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,830
before this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to pass the magic</font>

71
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:26,190
tcam limit for everybody we passed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

72
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:31,090
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think 2003-4 128k and in 2008 for</font>

73
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,620
256k so here comes 512<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we looked at</font>

74
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:35,770
this curve and you can plot it right out

75
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,570
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime in 2015 as</font>

76
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,950
we enter 2015 we're probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

77
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:45,250
at a solid 519 as consensus because it's

78
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:46,780
been another big growth here and so of

79
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">course you know that crosses the line</font>

80
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,670
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cross the 512k limit and</font>

81
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,839
if you extrapolate it's probably going

82
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,790
to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the second week of</font>

83
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">November so we have about a month to go</font>

84
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,130
again before the consensus reaches that

85
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:02,020
point lots of people already think this

86
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,049
has happened because lots of people have

87
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,850
full tables that are reasonably large

88
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:10,390
we're just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the consensus</font>

89
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,560
view so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can drill in on this and I</font>

90
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:14,820
know you're saying wait a minute we had

91
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,519
the 512k day it was back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> August well</font>

92
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,750
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really I mean to figure out why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

93
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,289
have to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what what's happening</font>

94
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:25,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">here so about sixty percent of our peers</font>

95
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:28,540
actually believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

96
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,060
larger than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consensus figure the one</font>

97
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is most favored by the most number</font>

98
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,900
of people and today's consensus

99
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,169
estimates actually yesterday's because i

100
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:40,989
made the slides yesterday is 507 still

101
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:44,590
safely underneath 512

102
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:48,040
if you wanted to I wager there are

103
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:50,890
probably a couple dozen people in this

104
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,580
room who could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just pull out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some / 24 s</font>

105
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:56,140
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D aggregate to about 5,000 prefixes</font>

106
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,729
and get us across this line right now as

107
00:04:56,140 --> 00:05:04,810
we sit here if you want to if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

108
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:06,760
hearing pagers go off don't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what</font>

109
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:12,160
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened back on 12th August was</font>

110
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:14,349
kind of a preview it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a it was</font>

111
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,330
a preview you can't see it in our data

112
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,500
because it won't our resolution you

113
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,140
can't see it each one of these little

114
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">dots on the screen is an hour this</font>

115
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened for about 20 minutes and it was</font>

116
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,380
a normal intraday fluctuation right one

117
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:29,560
of the providers who<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will not name on</font>

118
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:32,110
this slide but i will name shortly d

119
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:35,200
aggregated 20,000 routes and pushed us

120
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:38,680
over the line so on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> day in august</font>

121
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,000
we push over the 512k line and we get

122
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,640
one of these plots which you've seen

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,890
Renesys do red green<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced withdraw</font>

124
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,669
plots in BGP announced withdraw rates

125
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:52,080
for a decade here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one so the</font>

126
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:55,480
advertisements are in green<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

127
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,180
withdrawals are in red these are rates

00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,630
at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-second resolution throughout</font>

129
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,440
this period of a few hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

130
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:07,090
see it's a log scale first of all but

131
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">even so you can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's</font>

132
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,810
interesting because the advertisement

133
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,690
speak first because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started to get</font>

134
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:15,190
some BGP session resets from some of our

135
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,320
peers who then sent us a full table

136
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:19,600
which happened to be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very large full</font>

137
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,190
table at the moment and so that's the

138
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,290
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> spike but then the red spike comes</font>

139
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,120
very shortly thereafter and it's almost

140
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">as large this is a huge number of</font>

141
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,250
withdrawals more than you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

142
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,340
given what was being announced at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

143
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,320

145
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:42,430
diverse problems around the world and so

146
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:45,430
we have our guess right there there was

147
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:49,570
lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> equipment that had run out of</font>

148
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:51,820
space in tcam to store all of the 512

149
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:54,210
that as of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> morning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this was August</font>

150
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,289
so it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only about 500 k and the can</font>

152
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:06,469
701 d aggregated these 30,000 / 24 and

153
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,610
30 or 60 seconds later<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had this storm</font>

154
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,870
because the consensus routing table

155
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:13,800
suddenly was five hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font>

fine again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay here's just another view</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of the withdrawal rates again log scale</font>

00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,479
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see this amazing surge that</font>

168
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:46,020
so most of the prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> got taken</font>

most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the damage was done in terms of</font>

earth I mean superficially it does you

188
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,588
impacts in that withdrawal surge that

exceed what you would expect based on

<font color="#CCCCCC">people everywhere</font>

200
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,489
I'll show you in a minute what I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

201
00:09:14,609 --> 00:09:20,129
to do is take these affected prefixes

202
00:09:17,489 --> 00:09:22,589
and find out what happens to them in the

203
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:23,999
follow-on study which happens starting

204

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> week of november</font>

205
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:29,220
when 512k becomes the new normal

206
00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:32,309
everywhere we will find out whether

207
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,989
these prefixes are going to have

208
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,910
problems again or whether the routers

209
00:09:33,989 --> 00:09:40,410
that had problems the first time were

210
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:43,139
upgraded or have their tcam readjusted

211
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,689
to take away all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tcam for ipv6 and</font>

00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:49,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">give it to I beat before instead so</font>

213
00:09:45,689 --> 00:09:52,410
here's an example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a bad outcome here</font>

get traces into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of x on</font>

00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:24,900
impacted as well so again some

250
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,840
thing here was exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the 512k</font>

255
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,400
routers have been appropriately upgraded

or reconfigured so that this doesn't

257
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:46,260
happen as this becomes normal so just to

258
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:48,840
sum up the the the probability<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

259
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,990
were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day on 512k day</font>

260
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:54,060
was not uniform<font color="#E5E5E5"> across the world there</font>

261
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,800
were particular countries but more

262
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,510
probably particular providers and

263
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,740
actually more specifically specific

264
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:04,410
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who had some work to do and did</font>

265
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,500
not have that work completed before 512k

266
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:10,199
became the new normal so think of this

267
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a free warning is a ten-minute</font>

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,710
because of up and to the right 512k will

be here in consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> for everyone</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the second week of November about a</font>

go out and and fix what needs to be
