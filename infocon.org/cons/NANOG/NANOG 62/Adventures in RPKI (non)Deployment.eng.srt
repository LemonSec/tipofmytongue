working group had this report on secure

about was good eat your vegetables get

deployment of rpi router origin

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:56,830
validation and it became my job to

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,960
figure out how to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so as I went</font>

16
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">through and tried to get prepared</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,820

18
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,490
details and and i found out that while

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,860
it is deployable the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pr that's saying</font>

yes this is absolutely ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

21
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:15,090
it's easy and you should all just go do

00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:23,440
it it comes with a couple of asterisks

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:24,940
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just my experiences so this</font>

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,270
is this is something where your mileage

25
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,289
may vary and not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the concerns</font>

26
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:30,640
that I raised are going to apply to

00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:34,120

so you give priority to bang for the

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,079

<font color="#E5E5E5">of can i do it now do I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font>

72
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:17,630

basically walk the tree to find them all

106
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:25,730
the relying parties have to sync with

doesn't validate then the row gets

115
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:45,470
tossed out and unless there's another

116

unknown if the crypto does validate then

118
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,490
the data on that row is added to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

list of prefix and asn mappings that the

sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the router and then the router</font>

looks at all the different prefix asn

123
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,260
data to determine which ones are covered

124
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,690

make decisions about what to do with the

different types of prefixes there's

131
00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:21,229
basically two models of sign signing

prefixes that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosted model is sort of easy mode</font>

because a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more complex pki</font>

148
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,130
with their policies and there's

149
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,960
certainly a lot of places where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

150
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,630
could substitute your local<font color="#E5E5E5"> rir for</font>

151
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,549
Aaron but because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not as familiar</font>

152
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,270
with their their methods and their

153
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:13,039
policies your mileage may vary the

154
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,080
difficulty here in terms of a hosted

155
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,599
service is that when it's good it's

156
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,700
great but when it's bad it's really bad

157
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,630
because you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little control</font>

158
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:26,030
over what breaks or why it breaks or

159
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:27,349
when it gets fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you don't have a</font>

160
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,888
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of control over the chain of custody</font>

161
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:31,580
for things like your private key

162
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,830
ultimately you have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this</font>

163
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,630
in terms of the difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

164
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,310
SLA that you offer your customers and

165
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,380
the SLA you're offered for this hosted

166
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:41,240
service if you're relying<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the service</font>

167
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,180
you just apply to limit to your SLA or

168
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,610
taking on an additional risk of

169
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,439
violating it and so we're back to the

170
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,180
risk versus reward in terms of what's

171
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,139
the benefit of deploying you also

172
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,810
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that this works you</font>

178
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:09,400
this is a lot like updating who is to

179
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,299
reflect delegation but it's probably

180
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to require some additional</font>

191
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:41,020
the way the software is packaged for

192
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:44,258
this it does have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> setup that you</font>

193
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:46,419
could run it all in one box if you want

194
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,039
or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have one box for your relying</font>

party in one box for your certificate

00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:51,849

<font color="#E5E5E5">for a certificate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> authority</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you end up</font>

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,940
split<font color="#E5E5E5"> your certificate authority across</font>

202
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,440
two boxes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the machinery</font>

203
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,240
to sign things when your private key on

a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> box that's the actual</font>

205
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,139
certificate authority and then the

206
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,620
machinery<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the publishing on a</font>

207
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:15,819
public box that's the publication point

208
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,259
and then you'll like we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

209
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:18,930
separated from the relying party simply

210
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:22,990
because it's sort of a different set of

211
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:24,580
requirements for those boxes you still

212
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:26,500
need the same machinery to handle some

213
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,849
downstream customer delegations but in

214
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,990
this case the system is all in your

215
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:32,010
control so you're not having to worry

216
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:37,180
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> making it talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a third</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> party</font>

217
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:39,189
mood lighting and in either case you're

00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">still going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be using aaron's ta for</font>

219
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,470
part of this and there's some questions

220
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:47,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that high availability</font>

221
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:47,670
might work in this in this setup

222
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:53,829
so no matter which model you use you're

223
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,610
gonna have to generate some<font color="#E5E5E5"> rows and</font>

224
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,250
that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to know what</font>

225
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,920
prefixes prefix like ranges and which a

226
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,510
sng need to assert if you can't answer

227
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:04,130
these questions with reasonable

228
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,540
certainty then you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really be sure</font>

229
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:07,760
you're signing your prefixes correctly

230
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,829
and if you sign them incorrectly say if

231
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,769
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign a super net where I'm which</font>

232
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:14,029
there you have delegated subnets and

233
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:17,570
they're being originated by a different

234
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:19,220
asn you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> make those subnets invalid</font>

235
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:20,240
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who validate that means</font>

236
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,740
that those routes are going to get

237
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,810
dropped and those customers are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

238
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,370
go offline<font color="#E5E5E5"> for those of you who saw</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">reini bushes talk in a security track</font>

240
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,089
yesterday you've seen proof that this is

241
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly what's happening and so clearly</font>

242
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:35,959
we need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying closer attention to</font>

243
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:37,490
this but fortunately everyone has a

244
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:38,930
great database for IP address

245
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,060
allocations and which a SMS are

246
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,560
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and in their IP</font>

247
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,089
address management software so this is

248
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,959
just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter of connecting the rpi</font>

249
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:49,959
machinery to the API right I know I do

250
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:55,730
so it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to compensate some for</font>

251
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:57,949
dodgy records by signing broader ranges

252
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,860
yeah if you don't know how far you might

253
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:02,600
might delegate a subnet you can generate

254
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,190
a row so it includes a prefix range for

255
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,970
the super net all the way down to a

256
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:10,130
subnet and if you have multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASNs</font>

257
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,510
like my network and you aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

258
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,540
which one might originate you can

259
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:16,339
generate a row for both a SS but

260
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,020
generally you're the better the more

261
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:19,190
granular you can be in your signing the

262
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,839
better protection<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to have</font>

263
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,640
and you still have to know what you've

264
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:25,399
allocated to other<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers so you</font>

265
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,920
don't take them off long you can also do

266
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,240
things like baseline your info for

270
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,250

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,420
an initial bootstrap because if you keep

probably a good as<font color="#E5E5E5"> good excuse as any to</font>

280
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,800
fix some of the tooling problems that

281
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:58,899
are causing database rot in first place

282
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,128
and

283
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,779
you know if you already had to do an IP

<font color="#E5E5E5">address audit this is a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which a</font>

285
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:07,800
good reason to do it and once you've

286
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,420
signed you have to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

287
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,910
validation for everyone else's prefixes

288
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,529
so that means you're looking at setting

289
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:18,219
up relying parties and doing some

290
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:21,069
configuration for routers in order to

take advantage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the building</font>

292

building the<font color="#CCCCCC"> are peas with enough</font>

293
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,290
redundancy is pretty easy because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

294
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,980
can have multiple relying parties in the

295
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:31,179
network in different places and you can

296
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,920
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put them where they make sense</font>

297
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:36,579
in terms of proximity to the routers and

298
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,079
and how much geo diversity there is but

299
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:40,059
you do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about the the</font>

300
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,920
bootstrap case which is you know so how

301
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:44,230
does a router reach the RP to do

302
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,519
validation when it first comes online so

303
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,529
that you can avoid the case where the

304
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,509
router comes online converges and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

305
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,800
has to reconvert once it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

306
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:56,410
reach the RP and have validation

307
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:58,349
information so that one of the issues

308
00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:01,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">here is that most folks already have</font>

309
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,129
existing local pref to set and

310
00:12:01,749 --> 00:12:06,339
manipulate and move traffic around the

311
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:08,740
network have to be careful about the

312
00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:09,999
union of this existing policy plus the

313
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,470
new policy that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting in for</font>

314
00:12:09,999 --> 00:12:14,290
RPG I to make sure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it does what you</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">want it might require</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have to</font>

316
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,089
set a range of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different local profile</font>

317
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,769
use for valid and unknown based on what

318
00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:24,879
the existing value was and some logic

319
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:26,949
around that and then the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

320
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:29,259
here is since<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have multiple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asns my</font>

321
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:32,559
definition of things like an<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS border</font>

322
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:33,670
router is a little hazy you know I have

323
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,649
the option of you trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to carry</font>

324
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,360
validation state which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a technically</font>

325
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:40,779
a non transitive community across my

internal<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS boundaries or i can do</font>

327
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:45,819
validation at multiple edges they're

328
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:47,110
sort of pros and cons to<font color="#CCCCCC"> both some of it</font>

329
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:48,699
it has the bearing of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many routers</font>

330
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:50,769
actually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the RPG i capable</font>

00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:52,719
code how much configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm doing</font>

332
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:54,249
how many need to talk to the RP versus

333
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,420
simply looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local prep policy</font>

334
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:57,999
and doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in routing policy</font>

335
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,649
like they do today what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up with</font>

336
00:12:57,999 --> 00:13:00,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that it's best to validate the actual</font>

337
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:03,249
edge of the network so that you're

338
00:13:00,939 --> 00:13:05,189
already you're you're dropping invalid

339
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:07,809
routes as soon as they come in and

340
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:09,910
you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> having to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do revalidation and</font>

341
00:13:07,809 --> 00:13:11,209
then since we already have<font color="#E5E5E5"> machinery to</font>

342
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,069
do things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kerry local</font>

343
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:14,989
across a s boundaries using communities

344
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:21,050
and use the exact same<font color="#E5E5E5"> machinery and</font>

345
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:22,459
have this be a little more seamless so

346
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,498
when you start putting servers and

347
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:26,989
applications into the critical<font color="#CCCCCC"> path for</font>

348
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:29,389
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network it breaks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our fairly tidy</font>

349
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:34,009
idea of keeping applications and network

350
00:13:29,389 --> 00:13:35,929
and separate organizational silos we see

351
00:13:34,009 --> 00:13:37,369
some versions of this today on Sdn

352
00:13:35,929 --> 00:13:38,869
because you're often<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeding part of the</font>

353
00:13:37,369 --> 00:13:41,509
control plane in the routers which are

354
00:13:38,869 --> 00:13:43,069
managed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by one group to an application</font>

355
00:13:41,509 --> 00:13:45,230
running on servers which are typically

356
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:46,399
managed by another this adds more fun

357
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it includes all this mucking</font>

358
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,720
about with<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki which may either have</font>

been<font color="#CCCCCC"> in applications function the guys</font>

360
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,350
who already deal with TLS certs or it

361
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,490
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a security function because</font>

362
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:58,639
it's about handling of secure

363
00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,429
information or it might be both the I

364
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,720
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer is a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easier for</font>

365
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:04,369
the relying party since it's already

366
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,249
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routers and as a fairly</font>

367
00:14:04,369 --> 00:14:10,209
limited role in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki side but the CA</font>

368
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:13,279
is a little bit of a gray area because

369
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:16,189
it's more of an application<font color="#CCCCCC"> like say DNS</font>

370
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,600
but it has this<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk that it causes</font>

371
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,309
routing problems for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your customers if</font>

372
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,999
it breaks such that the routing folks

373
00:14:19,309 --> 00:14:24,379
might still want control it also has

374
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:27,529
this requirement for some knowledge

375
00:14:24,379 --> 00:14:29,720
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki which may not be in the router</font>

376
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:31,939
jockeys area of expertise I know it's

377
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,369
certainly not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in mine so there's a</font>

378
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:37,069
learning curve there if you split

379
00:14:34,369 --> 00:14:38,720
signing and publication it gets a little

380
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:40,790
easier because then the compartments

381
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,410
start making a little more sense the

382
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:44,209
publication point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just an application</font>

383
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,730
is maintained like like any other

384
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:49,699
critical external application like DNS

385
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:52,879
and it's just taking input for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

386
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:55,309
accuracy from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network folks and so</font>

387
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,499
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a there's a little more</font>

388
00:14:55,309 --> 00:15:00,350
simplicity there and then the CA is made

389
00:14:57,499 --> 00:15:02,269
it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any other CDA would be this</font>

390
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,949

392
00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:06,709
problem but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely something</font>

393
00:15:05,299 --> 00:15:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to consider when deploying in a</font>

394
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:09,160
large network

395
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,960
so getting any new technology is

396
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,810
deployed getting it deployed is hard

397
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:23,300
because it requires some sort of what

398
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:25,130
either a flag day or good support for

399

incremental deployment<font color="#CCCCCC"> citehr has good</font>

deployment which i think is realistic in

402
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,599
this case but when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about what</font>

00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said a few slides ago about when the</font>

405
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,740
incremental deployments are a little bit

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tough sell and I'm generally a big</font>

sometimes fall into is that fail open

412
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:56,270
gets used as a crutch to reduce the the

risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the perceived risk and severity</font>

of the potential failures and in order

have swung a little too far in the other

418

direction where it starts creating a

419

disincentive to deploy so when I talk

they act as a group different pieces

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:24,230
of the concerns around availability are

source of authority authoritative info

if you split out the certificate

matters from an availability perspective

431

because unless certificates are expiring

there's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a small</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> delay</font>

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,270
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it lots of pieces can be</font>

438
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,400
down for brief periods and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

439
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the impose cached and it doesn't</font>

440
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,510
get stale immediately and the parts that

441
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:58,490
are that must always be<font color="#CCCCCC"> available or</font>

442
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,840
duplicated in geo diverse your root

443
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:03,980
servers you're off servers things like

444
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:06,949
that however rpki doesn't have the

445
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,480
benefit of multiple duplicate and

446
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:11,030
diverse authoritative data sources

447
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:15,530
because right now there can only be one

448
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:17,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">uri for the TA and it can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only point to</font>

449
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:19,160
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> uri for a CA for a given set of</font>

450
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:21,079
resources so when one of those is down

451
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">that info goes unavailable</font>

452
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:25,918
part of the catch there is the the RP

453
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,089
does cash the you r is for the CA so it

454
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,179
can hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> them directly if the TA</font>

455
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:32,970
disappears and it caches the info it

456
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:35,909
gets from each CA so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more a</font>

457
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,730
matter of how how it handles things like

458
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:40,320
staleness and<font color="#CCCCCC"> exbury and how it handles</font>

459
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,450
initial boot straps so when you bring a

460
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,520
new RP online for the first time and it

461
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,990
can't reach<font color="#E5E5E5"> something or if you bring it</font>

462
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:49,168
online after some failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effect</font>

463
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:52,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's persistent storage unavailable</font>

464
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,460
is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just unknown routes so things</font>

465
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,250
aren't technically broken but we've

466
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,020
failed open again and fallen back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

467
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,730
protection so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm losing the</font>

468

<font color="#CCCCCC">the first place there are certainly ways</font>

470
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,130
to use load balancers or DNS priority to

471
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,539
work around<font color="#CCCCCC"> the single URI but given</font>

472

473
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:15,600
little curious and I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of have</font>

474
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,270
the feeling that high availability<font color="#CCCCCC"> load</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">balancing trying to do geo diversity in</font>

476
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,360
order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work around this problem seems</font>

477
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,949
kind of overly complex or something in

478
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,250
the critical path of the routing

479
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:31,320
infrastructure so the goal with

480
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,880
distributed systems like this is you

481
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,860
want the rate of rate of change to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

482
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,240
slow enough and the synchronization to

483
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,340
be fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough that you're actually in</font>

484
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">sync most of the time or at least longer</font>

485
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:42,990
than you're out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sync but with this</font>

486
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,639
system it's hard to know when that sink

487
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,559
is is actually achieved because there

488
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,690
are no serial numbers like a DNS zone

489
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,428
and so what you end<font color="#CCCCCC"> up having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

490
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,990
choose an update and synchronization

491
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:55,260
frequency that keeps pace with that rate

492
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:57,210
of change but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know that for</font>

493
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:59,789
sure at scale and so there's some trial

494
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:01,380
and error there and as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> system grows</font>

495
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:03,299
the current way that we district and

496
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,830
distribute things is likely to encounter

497
00:19:03,299 --> 00:19:06,210
some scaling problems you can see in the

498
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,879
reference presentation there's a better

499
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">discussion about those scaling issues</font>

500
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,030
but it's likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sink harder</font>

501
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,710
especially if we get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> aggressive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

502
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,289
more frequent in the way that we do our

503
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,669
synchronization we can certainly gained

504
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,169
some improvement by throwing the right

505
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:21,809
switches in our sink and tuning the file

506
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:23,549
system doing things like that but there

507
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:25,168
isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really one document that says this</font>

508
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:26,789
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best practice of way to do this</font>

509
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:29,090
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> even that is going to be trial</font>

510
00:19:26,789 --> 00:19:29,090
and error

511
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,770
if we were to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the design a little</font>

512
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:37,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">and add a some sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a hierarchy so</font>

513
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:40,389
that every RP isn't talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> every CA</font>

514
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:44,290
we have the problem of inconsistent info

515
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,790
may may providing wider damage so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

516
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:47,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a matter of better</font>

517
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:52,120
defining what's an acceptable level of

518
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:55,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">consistency so that we avoid failing</font>

519
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:56,860
open more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessary and kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

520
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:58,600
keeping in mind what can happen when we

521
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,100
have inconsistent data that conflicts

522
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:06,189
and then causes the wrong choice to be

523
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,810
made so even if the system is<font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

524
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,490
and internally consistent there's some

525
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:12,100
risk that the data is garbage whether

526
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,110
it's accidental or purposeful some of

527
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:16,959
the garbage<font color="#E5E5E5"> data goes back to fail open</font>

528
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,550
if you have an invalid certificate that

529
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,020
just gets trashed and any prefixes that

530
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,149
are that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have matched it or</font>

531
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:24,310
considered unknown but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

532
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:26,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases where the certificate is valid but</font>

533
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,750
it's wrong and that does more damage

534
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,929
because routes that are found<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

535
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:34,180
invalid are dropped from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font>

536
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:37,600
there's also a parent-child hierarchy

537
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,730
between certificates that basically

538
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,320
makes the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process for revocation and</font>

539
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,600
reissued like you might do in a transfer

540
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:45,700
sort of fiddly and fragile there's an

541
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,469
order of operations question here and if

542
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details about this you can</font>

543
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:51,220
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the draft here or talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to Jeff</font>

544
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:52,750
Houston because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could waste a lot of</font>

545
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,760
time on it and still not explain it as

546
00:20:52,750 --> 00:21:01,420
well as he can and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have a cool</font>

547
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:03,370
accent so it's not nice to show up at an

548
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">analog</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the warts of a</font>

549
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:06,699
system without talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

550
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,470
possible solutions even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're sort</font>

00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of simplified in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> non-experts solutions</font>

552
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:14,620
so I gave<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a go most of the things we</font>

553
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,020
learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet and how it</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">works is building a reliable network out</font>

555
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,760
of unreliable elements so my focus for

556
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,440
improving availability is on removing

557
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,050
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those single points of failure i</font>

558
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,490
highlighted in this case removing the

559
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,350
dependency on single you our eyes and

560
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,030
allowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than one discrete hostname</font>

561
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:32,800
and domain gets us a long way towards

562
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,290
mineralizing those failure cases for

563
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,530
accessing the authoritative info that we

564
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,120
need for the system and it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

565
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:42,040
without requiring the overhead

566
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a load balancer we could certainly</font>

567
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,389
use any cast as an alternative here but

568
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:48,130
with our sink that leads to this

569
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,810
assumption that during failure the

570
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,680
session that have to reset and start

571
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:56,230
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> with no state and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pushes us</font>

572
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,800
toward a more rigid need for consistency

573
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:01,690
between the different systems and scale

574
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,680
the reference here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ditching our sink</font>

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,090
you can certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that</font>

576
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,790
presentation at another time when we're

not trying to hurry<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get the lunch</font>

sink in this system there's sort of two

581
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,179
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consistency that mattered here</font>

582
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:21,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">sink in a synchronization between the c8</font>

583
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,650
publication points and with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPS that</font>

584
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,240
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them that's that's a loser sort</font>

585
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,100
of consistency<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's</font>

586
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,630
consistency among the redundant

587
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:36,909
authoritative elements in the system

588
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:39,550
which has to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a lot more rigid the the</font>

589
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:41,350
publication point RP sink is is likely

590
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,850
to be limited by the scale as a function

591
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:47,530
of how long<font color="#CCCCCC"> it takes to actually sink</font>

592
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:48,760
and by how how we determine when things

593
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:50,170
are stale how often they must be

594
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,100
refreshed how do you how often<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a</font>

595
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:56,320
recheck one possible idea in the draft

00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:57,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm referencing here is it makes this</font>

597
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,389
work a little more like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this DNS zone</font>

598
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,770
transfer otherwise what we end up we we

599
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,450
also have some possibility to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get in</font>

600
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:06,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">some scale improvement by doing</font>

601
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,980
something like atomically sinking a sync

602
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:13,350
signal file rather than thousands of

603
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,730
individual files the sync between

604
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,800
individual cas that are redundant for

605
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,590
one another or TAS you could do that via

606
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,270
atomic sink as well the TA level what

607
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:24,669
this might mean is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron's ta backs</font>

608
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:26,710
up ripes and vice versa or that Aaron

00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,240
actually publishes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to but they always</font>

610
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:31,450
stay in absolutes sink like a pair<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

611
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:34,300
DNS root servers at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CA level you can</font>

612
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:37,270
use a similar idea but local to a given

613
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,190
CA administrative domain if I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

614
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,350
than one server with a set<font color="#E5E5E5"> of certs that</font>

615
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,300

simultaneously as possible so they all

619
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:50,980
had the same view of the universe that

620

<font color="#CCCCCC">way it doesn't matter which one you ask</font>

621
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:57,910
you're going to get the right answer or

622
00:23:52,179 --> 00:24:00,460
at least a consistently wrong one our

623
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:05,049
PPI has similar data accuracy problems

624
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:07,090
to routing databases and who is the the

625
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:09,730
data does rot if you don't keep it

626
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,530
updated some some of the things some of

627

<font color="#E5E5E5">those get solved in this case with a</font>

628
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:14,049
combination of automation and the fact

629
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:16,120
that if you let the date of stale it

630
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:20,950
causes outages but it still requires

631
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:22,449
some focus ensuring the the accuracy and

632
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,640
protecting against the mistakes and

633
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:26,350
fraud often comes down to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

process<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets followed and how r it</font>

641
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:43,750
there's a learning curve there the legal

642
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:46,330
side is a little unknown and potentially

643
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:49,030
nasty there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about who is</font>

644
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:51,330
allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> take you offline you</font>

can do things<font color="#CCCCCC"> like revoked revoked</font>

647

that make any<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcement invalid it's</font>

648
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,190
so it sort of starts looking like where

649
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,320
we end up blocking content for filtering

650
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,820
or DDoS or issuing a legal tape down to

651
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,220
a content provider gets shut down a

652
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,840
website it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear that there's any</font>

653
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:12,100
sort of precedent or burden of proof

654
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,080
that this happens the right way with

655
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,879
proper justification and documentation

656
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:19,210
and that it's done such there is no

657
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:20,830
collateral damage that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a</font>

658
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,929
protocol or technology problem either

659
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,908
it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a policy one but it's very</font>

660
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:27,460
real issue that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort</font>

00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">becomes a matter of sorting it out</font>

reactively and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's going to</font>

665
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,620
go badly I think Randy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bush was the one</font>

666
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,020
that coined the phrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dutch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Court</font>

668
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see some of the discussion that's</font>

669
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,090
already happened around this if you look

670

for those terms along with RBI in your

00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:51,270
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've talked about thus far</font>

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">are solvable</font>

674
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:56,850
technology problems or policy gotchas or

675
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:58,920
things like that but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really is the</font>

676
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:02,129
the primary reason why my company is not

proceeding with with deployment using

678

00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:10,800
for doing so I passed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> through our</font>

685
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:20,190

00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:21,719
ours did but<font color="#E5E5E5"> after some discussions with</font>

some folks who are lawyers we will sort

<font color="#E5E5E5">of distill this down to a couple of</font>

689
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:27,570
significant things we think need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

690
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:31,100
changed in order for us to consider

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:31,100
signing an agreement<font color="#E5E5E5"> around this service</font>

692
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,970
so some reads of indemnify and hold

693
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,650
harmless mean that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're both party</font>

694
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:41,190
to our lawsuit we're required to defend

695
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,050
not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> ourselves to show that we're</font>

696
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,820
not at fault but also defend Aaron so

697
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,919
that opens<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a lot of risk for us as</font>

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,840
the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this service regarding a</font>

699
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,090
warranty statement the reason I bring

700
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,649
this up is that we've already had the

701
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,300
arguments about free and open source and

702
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,470
our lawyers have made their peace with

703
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,639
that they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> happy about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it but at</font>

704
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:03,900
least it's something we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to re</font>

705
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:06,170
argue and that that that makes it one

706
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,740
less thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to battle on</font>

707
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,690
ultimately though there's a lot of

708
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,040
boilerplate that absolves Aaron of any

709
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:15,120
responsibility to make the service

710
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:17,610

714
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,840
here my goal isn't to try to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

715
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:29,250
sue Aaron if things go pear-shaped my

716
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,110
goal is to know that aaron has some

717
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:33,300
level of skin in the game to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure</font>

718
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,399
that this mission critical service is

can understand the need to have Aaron

727
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,020
members sign an agreement covering the

728
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,350
terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service that Aaron is</font>

729
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:03,270
providing to them but requiring any RP

730
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,168
to sign even if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

731
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:06,359
business relationship

732
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:08,700
with aaron is<font color="#E5E5E5"> rupp would be roughly</font>

733
00:28:06,359 --> 00:28:10,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">equivalent to verisign requiring you to</font>

734
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,759
sign a legal document before you're

735
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,769
allowed to query the service to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

736
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,220
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm is we just mean that no one</font>

737
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:19,619
would use calm and this may be a problem

738
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">of legal risk so perhaps there's a</font>

739
00:28:19,619 --> 00:28:24,059
structure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allows Aaron to assume</font>

740

the right level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk with a fee that</font>

741
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,210
covers this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ultimately</font>

742
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:29,269
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a free and opt-in service right</font>

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:31,619
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we pay for</font>

754

interact with global routing we probably

have a ways to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move from rars</font>

the policy development process is one of

<font color="#E5E5E5">those areas we're going to have to</font>

760
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,440
evolve so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a bottom-up open</font>

method for its members<font color="#CCCCCC"> to direct how the</font>

00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:16,739
system is implemented and managed so to

00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,080
use air and as an example here other

00:29:20,489 --> 00:29:24,389
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've already tried standing here</font>

767
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:25,799
today in discussing is publicly where

768
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,449
hopefully we have some Aaron members

769
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,580
listening is the only way i know to

770
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:31,200
influence this that seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a bit of</font>

771
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,519
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of making sure that</font>

772
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,389
this is done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a way that we can have</font>

773
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,389
confidence in the system

774
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,979
so

775
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,060
this is a little snarky and i'm not i'm

776
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,560
not saying any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things are</font>

777
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,780
particularly hard there's a learning

778
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,860
curve with anything new but i think the

779
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:51,389
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be making</font>

780
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:53,070
we need to be thinking in terms of

781
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:55,140
making the learning curve less steep and

782
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:58,429
the system more robust there's more

783
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,430
incentive to deploy more widely

784
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,889
as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said before I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RBI</font>

785
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:13,420
is under ploy able I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

786
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,770
it's ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> for deployment yet and as a</font>

787
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,330
result I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a set of things</font>

788
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:18,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we should be focused focusing on</font>

789
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:21,639
that we know work now with the idea that

790
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:22,990
as rpki continues to evolve it'll

791
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,520
provide further improvement over the

792
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:28,059
things we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of which</font>

793
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,049
I've listed here but rpki isn't going to

794
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,870
improve if there aren't enough people

795
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:33,190
poking at it and looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the areas</font>

796
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,239
where it's in need of improvement so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

797
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,590
hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this will show you that</font>

798
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,090
there's a good reason to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

799
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:38,620
getting familiar with how you might do

800
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:40,240
this on your network so that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

801
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:45,639
people smarter than me trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

802
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:50,679
the fine<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the holes so I my</font>

803
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,429
time says I have 25 seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> left I don't</font>

804
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:52,419
know whether we have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for</font>

805
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:59,380
questions or whether we're running to

806
00:30:52,419 --> 00:31:01,870
lunch we could take one<font color="#CCCCCC"> question okay</font>

807
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,630
real quick sex name and affiliation and

808
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:08,709
question the form of a comment what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

809
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:11,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">question so west john curran</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> president</font>

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:13,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">CEO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually think sorry I</font>

811
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:17,320
think the slides very good that you did

812
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,120
these slides the question is with

813
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,850
respect to the the legal agreements

814
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:27,010
obviously and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

815
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:30,129
currently multiple regions other rirs

816
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:33,100
also contain such language TWC's

817
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,080
business class service agreement

818
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,719
contains the same undiminished language

819
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,939
as it turns out so it's not unheard of

820
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,280
to see indemnification language having

821
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,650
said that it's true that there's a risk

822
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:46,510
involved and so by offering a service is

823
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:48,730
a risk and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't want to end up</font>

824
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:51,490
losing an entire registry because

825
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:52,690
something happened and much<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you</font>

826
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,610
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure aaron has skin in the</font>

827
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:56,410
game we want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure people using</font>

828
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,780
this take the right precautions in case

829
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:00,429
it fails so they don't you have the

830
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:01,990
right filters you have the right checks

831
00:32:00,429 --> 00:32:03,790
to make sure if there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> failure of a</font>

832
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">system you don't destroy your own</font>

833
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:07,320
routing so everyone's trying to make

834
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,030
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone has the right protections</font>

835
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,168
here's my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question you said Aaron</font>

836
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,740
members should get involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

837
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:16,510
that's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would like the Nana to</font>

838
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a node members can somehow get</font>

839
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:21,010
involved and acts

840
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:23,860
we participate maybe in one of the Aaron

841
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:27,070
sessions and tell us what you need and

842
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:29,020
in particular is if there was a paper

843
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,570
delivered from nanog if you would lead a

844
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:33,910
group to propose an answer would you do

845
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:36,280
that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that might be compelling on</font>

846
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,560
how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron board makes a risk</font>

847
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,879
decision yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's probably</font>

848
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,950
more discussion that has to happen

849
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,600
around what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right model is to</font>

850
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">address these kinds of things because</font>

851
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,260
this is this is one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

852
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,060
different sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operationally focused</font>

853
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,490
things that don't fit into<font color="#CCCCCC"> NR p.m. right</font>

854
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:53,560
now and therefore you know we definitely

855
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:55,810
have more work to do there and I'm happy

856
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:59,530
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do what I can in order to to move</font>

857
00:32:55,810 --> 00:33:02,379
that forward I think as far as the legal

858
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,760
wrangling is concerned some of it is you

859
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,230
know lawyers talking to lawyers or

860
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,890
whatever I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

861
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:14,080
necessarily about whether everyone has

862
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,700
indemnifying<font color="#E5E5E5"> there in their contracts or</font>

863
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,490
not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's probably are going on</font>

864
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:20,710
minutia well for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the RPK at the</font>

865
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,480
rpa that you click<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get the key people</font>

let's get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trust anchor you have to</font>

868
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:31,900
go click and agree to the rpa we could

869
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:34,240
just put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our cpa CA terms of</font>

want<font color="#CCCCCC"> it hidden rather than having</font>

874
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:51,160
explicitly visible we can do it but

875
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:53,590
right so I mean it be it may actually be

876
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:55,960
a question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how it's legally presented</font>

877
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,600
right and and some of this also is a

878
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,800
matter of like I out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of curiosity why</font>

879
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:05,020
when i was looking at this what i was

880
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:08,020
preparing the the cps i compared yours

881
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:09,130
right up against ripes<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe was the</font>

882
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,370
other one<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use i don't think i look</font>

883
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:16,380
today peenics yours has all the legal

884
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:16,380
eagle boilerplate in it ripes doesn't

885
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,399
right but there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> difference here the</font>

886
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,290
member agreements are only applicable to

887
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,990
the members the folks that use their ta

888
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:27,159
are not a net same situation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

889
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:28,540
the point I'm making here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

890
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:31,929
there's there's a distinction that we

891
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,340
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make between what what service</font>

892
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,350
agreement exists between Aaron and its

893
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,760
membership using the service versus

894
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:38,830
folks that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply third parties</font>

895
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,050
trying to get information that their

896
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:45,969
members want them to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the time</font>

00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:48,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one more place oh please please</font>

898
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:53,560
go ahead sandy please go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

899
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:56,700
sandy Murphy Parsons some points that

900
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:01,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">you made that our technical because I'm</font>

901
00:34:56,699 --> 00:35:04,359
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lawyer the multiple publication</font>

902
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:08,850
points for the trust anchors is already

903
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:13,780
a draft in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber working group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

904
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:16,029
is working group last call there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

905
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:19,240
suggestion of doing multiple publication

906
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:24,190
points for individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> CAS that's kind</font>

907
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:27,430
of going slower you talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about having</font>

908
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:29,080
multiple an analogy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNS system I</font>

909
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:30,609
kind of would hope that we would take

910
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,650
some of the lessons we've learned over

911
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,750
the many many years of deployment and

912
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,910
think about using<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the techniques</font>

913
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,940
and multiple route servers and

914
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:41,710
replication and I don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

915
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,960
managed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep all those things</font>

916
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:47,050
consistent but you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

917
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:49,390
would be lessons learned there the CA

918
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:52,540
and the private key in the publication

919
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:54,850
point there is a publication protocol so

920
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:57,790
if you in the site or<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group set</font>

921
00:35:54,850 --> 00:36:00,759
of documents if you wanted to outsource

922
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:03,970
the publication and have the publication

923
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,770
point handled by somebody else there's a

924
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,529
publication protocol so that you can

925
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,759
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them and separate those two</font>

926
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,600
functions and

927
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:16,570
do one of those years old and about the

928
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,610
indemnity clause in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> our PKA our PA</font>

929
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:21,070
i'm not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a</font>

930
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:23,560
legal concern there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one technical</font>

931
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:27,430
point in there about not being allowed

932
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,650
to share the data with anyone else so

933
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:33,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone has to go to Erin to get</font>

934
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:35,890
the data and and that has certain

935
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,650
ramifications on our architecture and

936
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:41,170
being able to get the data from your

937
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:43,720
neighbor when you start up a new isp or

938
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,120
a new connection and that's a technical

939
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,009
concern not a legal concern well I mean

940
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,200
I know that it derives from a legal

941
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,730
concern but yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's I can</font>

942
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,589
understand some of the reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> why erin</font>

943
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,030
has that requirement in there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

944
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:56,080
think there's probably that's another

945
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,700
one of those areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> where there has to be</font>

946
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,950
some more discussion to figure out what

947
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:04,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right balance between technical and</font>

948
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:06,430
legal action is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you so</font>

949
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:09,549
one last question this will be real

950
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:11,500
quick just a plus one on the on the deal

951
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:13,570
breakers and I think that to answer

952
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jon's question I think slide 21 and this</font>

953
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,630
presentation does a really good job by

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I'm like Sinatra vsn sorry about</font>

question slide 21 in wes's presentation

957
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:24,549
does a really good job of I think

958
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,819
explaining what needs to be done and

959
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:30,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what the framework ought to be</font>

960
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:32,890
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't ever sign this that</font>

961
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:36,430
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpa as it is it's illegal for</font>

962
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:37,629
me to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so on we can you know we</font>

963
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,890
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about changing the laws of the</font>

state of California as they apply to

965
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:43,720
state entities but that's the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font>

966
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:45,640
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a very strong</font>

968
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:52,470
that's in there not all indemnification

969
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,470
clauses are the same so that's all

970
00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:00,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">John said John said I'm bound you're</font>

touching the certificate because it's so

973
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:10,690
I'm going to suggest that this is a

974
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:15,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">great conversation to happen during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

978
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:24,000
kinds of agreements are making it very

979
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:24,000
hard to deploy this stuff

980
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,270
you
