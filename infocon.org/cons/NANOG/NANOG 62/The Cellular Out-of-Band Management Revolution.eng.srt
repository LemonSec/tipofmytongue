00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:14,760
hello everyone my name<font color="#CCCCCC"> is Dan Baxter I'm</font>

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,200
a sales engineer with open gear a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,599
bit about me I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in the</font>

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:22,500
out-of-band management field for about

5
00:00:18,599 --> 00:00:25,009
15 16<font color="#E5E5E5"> years in the last four years I've</font>

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,119
seen a big change where cellular

7
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:29,579
technologies have started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be embedded</font>

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,540
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of band and routing technologies</font>

9
00:00:29,579 --> 00:00:36,059
as well so I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come and talk to</font>

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:38,640
you today to to give you an introduction

11
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:41,190
into cellular routing and cellular

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,990
out-of-band management because what

13
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,970
we're finding is although many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,460
customers can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the internet work and</font>

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,019
keep their organizations networks going

16
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,880
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start to talk about things</font>

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,810
cellular it becomes very educational so

18
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:59,400
just wanted to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really broad</font>

19
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:01,350
overview today because cellular adoption

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,750
obviously it's no mystery there's huge

21
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,220
adoption going on today in America there

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,500
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> more cell phones than there are</font>

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,020
people and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's true around</font>

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,810
the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> four billion people and 3.7</font>

25

billion cell phones in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world but</font>

26
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,500
what's really surprising is that in the

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,840
last few years the trends shifting for

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,030
and so what this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing is driving</font>

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,710
following best practices around that

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,548
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be talking about two of the</font>

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:52,589
applications in this in cellular arena

42
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,600
cellular routing which is using the

43
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:58,229
cellular interface for routing traffic

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:00,119
between sites and cellular out of band

45
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,890
which would be using cellular to get

46
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to a remote site if there was a</font>

47
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,549
network outage you get you'd get access

48
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,409
to your remote out-of-band management

49
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,759
equipment bring the network up and

50
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:13,830
running they're two different but

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:16,290
similar scenarios so both share the idea

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,389
of a primary and a failover interface

53
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,429
both are similar in the security

54
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,170
concerns and both share<font color="#CCCCCC"> sim</font>

55
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,510
our IP plans that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get from the</font>

56
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,399
carrier but there's differences in how

57
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,189
you deploy them what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of security</font>

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,879
policies you'd put in place and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

59
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:35,069
costing on the plans so in the cellular

60
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,670
routing form factor you get kind of two

61
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:40,319
categories<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get adding adding cell to</font>

62
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,450

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can get to kind of categories and</font>

there's a che<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's high</font>

or a third situation where the unit is

77
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,429
standalone and it is the only routing

there's a protocol handling the failover

80
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,400
and typically there's two<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical</font>

then there's another mode IP pass

modes depending upon what you're what

110
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,280
there's there's

111
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,229
items where you'll take an existing

112
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,330
install and you'll add cellular to it

113
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:43,508
what the USB dongle or an external

114
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:46,240
adapter or you can get a device that has

know sell to an existing installation

119
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,539
there is a drawback though it introduces

120
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,190
a failure point dongles and and and the

121
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,990
cables are vulnerable they can be

122
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:05,289
damaged or move and you also have

123
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:07,150
third-party driver considerations is all

148
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,620
crucial to any of this is the idea

00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:16,360
failover so the the primary links up and

150
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:18,400
running you'll use that link with the

151
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,560
device but then there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some type</font>

152
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,628
of trigger whether a ping trigger or an

153
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,219
interface state change and the device

154
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:27,190
will recognize that change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and at that</font>

155
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:28,779
point it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will bring up the cell</font>

156
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:30,580
interface in some cases the cell

157
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,099
interface will be dormant meaning it has

158
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,378
a different route gateway on a metric on

159
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:40,690
it or it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just might be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> entirely turned</font>

160
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:43,719
off until it's needed so the challenges

161
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:46,000
around that in terms of the out-of-band

162
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:48,070
cellular strategies is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

little bit about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the cellular</font>

179
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:23,890
considerations one of the things that's

180
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:25,930
necessary is to understand what your

181
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,760
options are the costing the types of

182
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,500
plans you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carriers as</font>

183
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,840
well as the wavelengths because it

184
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:34,090
really it comes down to the band widths

185
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,539
and the wavelengths there is no

186
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:40,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-size-fits-all and in America</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

187
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,130
very very carrier specific so

00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,810
internationally it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little different</font>

189
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:45,909

221
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,470

to route that traffic across that link

megahertz do they support what bandwidth

238
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,480
and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to the hardware</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and you have to match up a similar</font>

00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,050
really gets complicated internationally

00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,580
sometimes different regions in Canada

244
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,130
will have different different<font color="#E5E5E5"> bands</font>

are great references up on the Wikipedia

there's two types of accounts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

typically I see customers going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with I</font>

249
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:13,579
like there's a consumer-grade account

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,260
then there's business great accounts and

251
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,930
the difference really is that a

252
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,520
consumer-grade account is the ipad a

253

discounts on the business side so that's

265
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,580
important to know when we talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

plans there they fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> into those two</font>

differently because it's used

differently and one meg is where you can

276
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,720
start off so there's a big difference

277
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,670
there between those two types of plans

can create a<font color="#E5E5E5"> private network cloud for</font>

290
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,760
you in the print and the private IP plan

291
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,850
it's the pros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cons are it's easy to</font>

292
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,620
get going<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a low upfront cost the</font>

293
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,080
downside is it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a private net</font>

294
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:55,600
address so you have to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

295
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,160
way to get to that device when that

296
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,200
usually has the devices usually

297
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,900
initiating that as an outbound ssh

298
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,120
session it could be an outbound VPN

299
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,220
session back to a VPN gateway and that

300
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:09,190
way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the limitation</font>

301
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,290
on that private net plan public IP plan

302
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,270
is great if you need to have a device

303
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:15,640
sit out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet it's going to be</font>

304
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:19,030
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> static IP or it's going to be</font>

305
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,180
dhcp if you do dhcp you can use<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

306
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:25,360
dns services let you know if the IP

307
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:28,030
address has changed you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

308
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about VPN technologies and some</font>

309
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:31,720
will talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about security</font>

310
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:34,089
and a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit here but that you can</font>

311
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,860
leverage VPN technology on that device

312
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:38,260
since it sits directly on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

313
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:41,800
it's easy to access but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to be</font>

314
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,510
securely it's got to be secured there is

315
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,140
a one-time setup for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this type of</font>

316
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,310
account it's five hundred dollars so if

317
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,439
you call up the carrier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I want</font>

318
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,910
to private I want a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want a</font>

320
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,420
it's going to be five hundred dollars

321
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:57,550
one time and then you as you add devices

322
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:03,040
in you just pay a monthly recurring fee

323
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:05,199
on those devices so a the pros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cons</font>

324
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,060
of the plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the pro is it's on</font>

325
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,190
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> con is it's on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

326
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,020
internet so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all comes down to</font>

327
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,450
security you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to firewall the rule</font>

328
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">that firewall the interface you want to</font>

329
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:17,620
control<font color="#E5E5E5"> the services that are active on</font>

330
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">the interface and you want to control</font>

331
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the amount of time that interface is</font>

332
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,400
active if it's not going to be used all

333
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,319
the time there's some sense in making it

334
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,850
not

335
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:31,110
dawn until you actually have a failover

336
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:32,610
situation a private carrier network is

337
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,500
really popular for customers with a

338
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,270
large deployment or someone with very

339
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,370
secure data and they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want their</font>

340
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:40,230
traffic going out with everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else's</font>

341
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">smartphone traffic when the carrier</font>

342
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,070
provides an isolated network and they

343
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,530
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> even create hardware isolated</font>

344
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,170
networks for you and you'll mpls into

345
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:51,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> network or you'll VPN on through a</font>

346
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:53,819
gateway on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so you're going</font>

347
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,280
to route between devices there they want

348
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,260
you to be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP maybe use a GRE</font>

349
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:00,240
tunnel they have very<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific</font>

350
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,130
requirements in that side that tunnel

351
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,970
what you can and can't do inside that

352
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:08,310
cloud that they've created for you so

353
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,440
it's it's it's great it's a great option

354
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,449
if you need to secure your data the only

355
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,890
drawback is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a road wire how</font>

356
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,360
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going to get in you you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

357
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:17,340
get into corporate to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

358
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,640
connection if your corporate sites down

359
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:24,600
you can't get into it the other part is

360
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,790
not every customer has VPN or mpls savvy

361
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,800
people on board or hardware so it really

362
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:31,819
it really needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a pros</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

363
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:35,130
cons one works best for further customer

364
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,470
so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> I our recommendations and best</font>

365
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,290
practices choose choose the best plan

366
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,660
based on your security needs and pursue

367
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:44,370
the business plans<font color="#E5E5E5"> over consumer buying</font>

368
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,900
bulk you get a better discount the more

369
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,660
you buy the more units you put on that

370
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">plan and you might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mobility group</font>

371
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,420
in your organization that's a great

372
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,550
place to start so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the costs of</font>

373
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:58,410
these different plans if I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

374
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">a cellular routing option for remote</font>

375
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,089
location and I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to verizon AT&T and i</font>

376
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:04,800
said i want to set up an outing account

377
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:08,340
it's going to start at 30 gigabytes and

378
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,650
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cost me $185 a month if</font>

379
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,750
it's an out-of-band an arrangement then

380
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,810
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be an m2m plan and it's</font>

381
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,150
five dollars a month and it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> meg as</font>

382
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,479
my entry point the reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

383
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:23,520
difference is a demand management over

384
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,560
cellular is really about<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH I've got a</font>

385
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,870
remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> site down and I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

386
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,540
and remediate that situation so getting

387
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,220
in remediating situation getting things

388
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:34,530
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and running I could use as much</font>

389
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,510
as a hundred kilobyte I could have 10 of

390
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">those instance in one month and still</font>

391
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,189
not go over that one

392
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,810
so when you consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're pulling it</font>

393
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:43,730
that's just that that's it's primarily

394
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:49,040
the reason why the two plans cost

395
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,930
differently so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea here is this</font>

396
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">is not your dad's modem I don't even</font>

397
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,880
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if modem is a good word for it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

398
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:58,010
it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> analog vt100</font>

399
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,780
modem like you used to get into AOL it's

400
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,150
an IP interface and that's the thing

401
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,709
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to recognize the</font>

402
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:05,360
plan that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get from the carrier is</font>

403
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:07,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an IP interface and it's</font>

404
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,250
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dictate your security policy so</font>

405
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:11,900
all the standard firewalling rules and

406
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,970
IP rules you would apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to any IP</font>

407
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,030
interface applies to the cellular

408
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:18,500
interface so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> specific plans you know</font>

409
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:20,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's going to be driven by your security</font>

410
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,700
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider tunneling even if you</font>

411
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,880
have a private network with the carrier

412
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,770
it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tunnel over that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

413
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,740
you consider turning off services do you

414
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,280
need HTTPS on that interface limit the

415
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,260
services I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all very basic</font>

416
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,699
security policies and it's all generate

417
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,040
you know all dictated by the fact that

418
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,540
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an IP interface the other thing</font>

419
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,219
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe you need to have some brute</font>

420
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:46,160
force protection on there like fail2ban

421
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:49,700
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> facing the internet with the</font>

422
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,290
static IP and also implement alerting

423
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,760
you want to know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> that interface goes</font>

424
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,839
active and it's facing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font>

425
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,730
internet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some kind of</font>

426
00:16:53,840 --> 00:17:00,920
failover situation you should be

427
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:02,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">notified that that that has happened so</font>

428
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:05,780
when we talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about going into two</font>

429
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,880
deployments initially the biggest

430
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,770
concern we get from customers is the

431
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,930
signal strength in the data center or to

432
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:15,470
remote site so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all comes down to our</font>

433
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:18,140
SSI or LTE signal strength it's a

434
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,600
negative<font color="#CCCCCC"> number in decibels and anything</font>

435
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,990
negative 40 is strong to negative 98

436
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:26,780
which is weak if it's beyond negative 98

437
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:28,160
the device may not activate so there's

438
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,139
some places you could check<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

439
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,460
always ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> people hey go walk in with</font>

440
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,440
your cell phone or I've been in there I

441
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,480
know with my signal strength was you can

442
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,150
also go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a site there's many like this</font>

443
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,560
for instance down detector calm it's a

444
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:42,140
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to track by carrier</font>

445
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:44,120
availability the only word of warning on

446
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,460
this is that smartphones fall into this

447
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:49,580
category but it's it's a good starting

448
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">point I think open signal is is pretty</font>

449
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,000
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well opensignal calm</font>

450
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,710
it's nice there is they've got a graphic

451
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,420
overlay so you can look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the region</font>

452
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,520
where your data center your site is and

453
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,970
then you can drill in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can see by</font>

454
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,560
2g 3G 4G<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see what you know is 3g</font>

455
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:07,160
going to be a stronger<font color="#E5E5E5"> signal for me is</font>

456
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">4G better what is the reliability in the</font>

457
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,270
area and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the uptime you know</font>

458
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:15,050
what is the ping and download and upload

459
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:17,300
speeds in that area my experience is

460
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:20,629
that 4G really has better coverage both

461
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,149
signal and coverage and signal strength

462
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:25,340
cell phones there they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

463
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,900
conservative so be careful if someone

464
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,850
said I didn't get really good signal so

465
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,440
sells out for us you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know be careful</font>

466
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,230
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because the cell phone is</font>

467
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,410
conservative and it's it's a reading of

468
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that signal strength so that if you look</font>

469
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,010
at a site survey and look at the best

470
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,170
better and good the cell phone is a

471
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,000
great place to start you can get an app

472
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,100
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your Android there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ginette</font>

473
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,770
trackers one that the verizon<font color="#CCCCCC"> essie's</font>

474
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,919
use and other customers have have

475
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,780
installed it it's a great tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

476
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,910
recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but you can put your iphone</font>

477
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:59,210
in field test mode and it'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you</font>

478
00:18:55,910 --> 00:19:01,970
our RSS I it'll show you this the cell

479
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,250
signal strengths even better is to take

480
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,290
the actual router or the embedded

481
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,600
cellular out-of-band management device

482
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,760
and take it walk it around they all tell

483
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,550
you the RSSI from the user interface and

484
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,590
even better is the best is a measurement

485
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,690
tool so you can get measurement tools

486
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:20,240
that will be carrier agnostic and will

487
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:24,140
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you 3g 4g signal strength at your</font>

488
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">sites typically when we see customers</font>

489
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,620
without a band cellular we see two

490
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,899
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> models whether they're going</font>

491
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:31,189
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a data center or a remote site at</font>

492
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,380
the data center it's usually one

493
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:35,090
cellular enabled device acting as a

494
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,710
gateway to all the other out-of-band

495
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,600
management devices so if there's an

496
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,640
outage they just need a single entry

497
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:45,260
point at a remote site you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> see a</font>

498
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,670
device installed at each location the

499
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,410
other thing that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really important in</font>

500
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:51,050
terms of deployment is that interface

501
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,640
handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's you need to consider how</font>

502
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:54,530
the hosts are going to route to that

503
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,360
interface<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do they know if there's</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">been a failover or there's an out a new</font>

505
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:01,820
route also you know do you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

506
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,680
that interface dormant that saves you on

507
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,179
costing you only going to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

508
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,400
interface when there's an outage

509
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,130
or an emergency it's also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to limit</font>

510
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">the amount of time the interface is</font>

511
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:15,380
available for malicious activity you

512
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,120
could also consider qos maybe not

513
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,490
everything needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go over to cellular</font>

514
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,750
interface when there is a failover maybe

515
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,800
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to get the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> most critical</font>

516
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,660
data across that interface and there's

517
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,889
also the ability to watch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interface</font>

518
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,630
to make sure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't go above your</font>

519
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,350
plan levels the one thing you don't want

520
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:35,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be surprised</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by some process running</font>

521
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,370
out of control or the cell interface

522
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,810
being used in a way you didn't expect

523
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:43,639
and only knowing about it when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bill</font>

524
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:47,149
comes so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best practices in</font>

525
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:50,330
general as a summary really no no your

carrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> no your plan options and and get</font>

527
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,530
to get your routing options in place

528
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:56,060
ahead of time conduct a site survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

529
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:58,310
the signal strengths and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

531
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if you have to switch plans the</font>

532
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:05,420
carrier making you again on a on a setup

533
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:07,220
fee and you know get to know your

534
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,140
carrier reps they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you</font>

535
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,330
they want to sell these lines they want

536
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,680
to sell the cellular plans to you and

537
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,500
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're very</font>

538
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:17,240
consultative and know that if you're

00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go internationally it's going</font>

540
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,750
to be different there will be different

541
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,350
standards internationally than in

542
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:26,300
America and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget about budgeting</font>

543
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:28,340
this is one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> gets passed up in</font>

544
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:30,560
traditionally phone lines as an

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,870
out-of-band option might have been

546
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,840
billed regionally now if it's a cell

plan it might be now build<font color="#CCCCCC"> centrally</font>

548
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,679
either way it's it's an item that you

549
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,270
should include in the budget as the

550
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,940
monthly recurring fee they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

551
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:45,320
high but you should account for them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

552

a separate IP interface it's accessible

555
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,350
during an outage and you can get data

and you can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> information and from</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">spend all this time trying to figure</font>

00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:46,659
this out<font color="#E5E5E5"> we noticed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we got what</font>

575
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,340
appeared to be a public IP when we first

576
00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:49,720
connected the cellular network well we

577
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,759
were kind of expecting that it would be

578
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,139
carrier-grade NAT 'add so like great

579
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,179
this is public IP we don't have to worry

580
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:57,178
about the net well it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out that and</font>

581
00:22:55,179 --> 00:23:01,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> name and shame t mobile</font>

582
00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:02,740
uses addresses that aren't assigned to

583
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,049
them on their cellular network that are

actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> natin so I forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> forget</font>

whose whose address block it was but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

586
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:11,168
was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprising once I looked into</font>

587
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:12,490
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we thought we had public real</font>

588
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:15,340
public ip's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were they were actually</font>

589
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,080
nodded but not using RFC 1918 address

590
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:18,279
space so we were scratching our heads

591
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:21,189
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite some time until we figured</font>

592
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:22,840
that up interesting interesting thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

593
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:24,129
don't know if any other carriers do that

594
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,379
too maybe maybe I<font color="#CCCCCC"> could turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that into</font>

595
00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:29,139
the question have you experienced<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

596
00:23:26,379 --> 00:23:30,939
carriers using address space that was

597
00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:32,889
not assigned to them I haven't it

598
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,889
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've you know I don't hear</font>

599
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:38,229
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything yeah what's that</font>

600
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:40,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rodgers yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't heard of that</font>

601
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:44,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's interesting thanks for sharing</font>

602
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:47,199
that andy liu j to just wanted to know

603
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,840
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public addresses if you go to</font>

604
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,750
different states do they change or does

605
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,649
it stay the same if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you if the device</font>

606
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:59,470
travels yes yeah tip typically in both

607
00:23:56,649 --> 00:24:01,508
verizon and AT&T that IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> address is</font>

608
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,309
always assigned to that device it's got

609
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:05,350
a phone number you can text the device

610
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:07,928
and say hey run a script do some things

611
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:10,480
but you can you can also always address

612
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:12,700
it by the same address<font color="#CCCCCC"> in canada it's a</font>

613
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,409
little different it may be a dhcp

614
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,950
address so as you move from system to

615
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:20,799
system it might change thank you joshua

616

<font color="#E5E5E5">cole Bart Ted knows so my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> question is</font>

617
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:24,010
about settle your frequencies so sprint

618
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,460
uses primarily

619
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,050
2.5 gigahertz further LT and 18<font color="#E5E5E5"> TM</font>

620
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:31,210
verizon are using around nine here

621
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,830
megahertz inside of data centers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

622
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,360
these the equipment you're talking about

623
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:36,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's primarily deployed have you seen</font>

624
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,669
coverage issues with higher frequency

625
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:44,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">bands or is that a known issue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font>

626
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:46,510
haven't necessarily we typically will

627
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:49,210
address situations like that by putting

628
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:51,460
a cable that's longer 20 30 40 foot<font color="#E5E5E5"> low</font>

629
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">loss cable and taking the antenna over</font>

630
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,530
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a spot where the signal strength is</font>

631
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:00,010
is greater but I band width wise I

632
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:02,020
haven't seen anything regarding that it

633
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,820
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be it may be going on I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just not</font>

634
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:05,410
aware have you had a situation where you

635
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,580
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement a small cell or is that</font>

636
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:10,480
another thing you had to do how do i

637
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:12,129
implement a small cell not yet not yet

638
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,440
again a<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer's may be doing a lot of</font>

639
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,850
our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> very self-sufficient but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

640
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,980
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I haven't had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

641

customer either say<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't strong enough</font>

642
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:21,550
and we had to switch or we had to

643
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,200
implement anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually they'll</font>

644
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:25,960
they'll kind of know it's it's either a

645
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,190
dead spot in the data center or not got

646
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:34,240
it thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you West George was</font>

647
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:35,710
time warner cable everybody can go ahead

648
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and check their bingo cards ahead of</font>

649
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,460
time but I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to congratulate you</font>

650
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,580
for spending all this time talking about

651
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,080
IP addressing and get you know different

652
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,460
flavors of carrier-grade NAT public

653
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,800
versus private and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Static and whatever</font>

654
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:53,350
without ever mentioning IP address

655
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:55,629
exhaustion or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 yeah I have seen on</font>

656
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nano groups a lot of discussion</font>

657
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:01,120
around IP version 6 and we've we've had

658
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:02,710
some discussions with customers over

659
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,649
that and they went they go to the

660
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:06,790
carriers and initially the sales teams

661
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:08,860
that the carriers are kind of like I'll

662
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:11,260
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check on that one their big</font>

663
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:15,030
question is if we're ip6 here and you're

664
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,030
not what are we going to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that</font>

665
