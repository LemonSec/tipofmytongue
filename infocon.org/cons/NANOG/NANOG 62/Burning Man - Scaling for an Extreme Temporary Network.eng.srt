1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,670
here we are we met

2
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,040
well good morning everyone thanks for

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,230
the opportunity to speak a little bit

4
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,230
about Burning Man originally the talk

5
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,390
was focused on automation but as the

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:33,970
presentation got reviewed by the program

7
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,910
committee and I did a few dry runs it

8
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,830
really covers a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about technology the</font>

9
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,599
design and a lot of the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight</font>

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,480
layer one issues so it's a very broad

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,430
talk that does include some examples of

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:48,760
the automation framework that we use but

13
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:51,220
it's not focused entirely on that again

14
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the last day long has Greg and others</font>

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,800
have mentioned we had over 850 attendees

16
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,960
and that's pretty significant numbers

17
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,239
and I don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> know everyone in</font>

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,160
the audience and at least when I'm on

19
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:05,349
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the podium I'd like to</font>

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,320
know who's talking so not everyone knows

21
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">my background worked at mas that</font>

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,690
specialize in delivering animated gifts

23
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:17,020
and cat pictures I've done<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amateur</font>

24
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:19,570
appearing I've also helped send and

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:22,720
receive money sometimes using that money

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,059
for amateur reasons and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course some</font>

27
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,270
community projects so the background is

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:30,220
definitely a mixture of content is be

29
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,619
kind of carrier and everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

38
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,530

39
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,449
a product that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically an</font>

or cumulus but in my my job typically

43
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:05,770
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get asked every two or three</font>

45
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:10,478
sdn thing or how do we get some of that

00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,010
open flow or net<font color="#CCCCCC"> devops or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> devops seems</font>

47
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,780
really cool we want to have some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

48
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there's a lot of buds words goin</font>

49
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:18,010
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry and what I've always</font>

50
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,739
told people whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a customer a</font>

51
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,590
partner or a friend is that if you can

52
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:25,810
build a network in the desert that<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

53
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,530
extreme conditions implied against it

54
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:30,140
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> for making an operator</font>

00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,360
and for the personnel operate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

56
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,829
network itself you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are folks</font>

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,260
that may be dehydrated<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

58
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:38,510
volunteers it may be distracted if you

59
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,970
can learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> from those lessons then you</font>

60
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:42,140
can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your own organization</font>

61
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:46,160
because again a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times when you're</font>

62
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,899
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of SDN DevOps</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenFlow a lot of</font>

63
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,209
that comes down to process and

64
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,620
procedures most people don't want to

65
00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,050
invent their own routing protocols

66
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,600
they're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in dis keeping things</font>

67
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,010
simple automating and moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,150
I think Bernie man is a good snapshot

69
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:04,130
into applying some of those approaches

70
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:07,250
to talk a little bit about the event

71
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:09,829
itself and the the physical location so

72
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,209
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a held in Northern Nevada it's</font>

73
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:17,330
about two and a half hours outside of

74
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:19,069
Reno so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's north east of Reno which is</font>

75
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:21,319
a lake tahoe region if you're familiar

76
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:22,970
for some of the skiers or outdoor

77
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,179
activities<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to exist in the audience</font>

78
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:29,510
and it's roughly around 70,000 people

79
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,750
that attend the event it's held on a dry

80
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,519
lake bed known as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> playa it's the</font>

81
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,440
Black Rock Desert and so the city name

82
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,320
is typically referred to as Black Rock

83
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:43,010
City it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> described as a social</font>

84
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,320
experiment or festival or party I don't

85
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:47,720
feel qualified to represent exactly what

86
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,859
Burning Man is it's something for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

87
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,859
it's something different for everyone

88
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,799
else I've had friends summarize it is

89
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,390
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the city of San Francisco</font>

90
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:58,070
transplants to the desert for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a week and</font>

91
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,750
I think that's a that's a good snapshot

92
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:04,579
so the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and bad things you could</font>

93
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:05,959
imagine of a an urban<font color="#E5E5E5"> city transported</font>

94
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,040
to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> rural environment that's that's</font>

95
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:08,720
kind of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happens with burning man</font>

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,760
it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the largest Leave No Trace</font>

97
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,040
events so what that means is that

98
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,540
there's zero infrastructure before the

99
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,608
event we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have about three weeks to set</font>

100
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,370
up there's the week of the event itself

101
00:04:16,608 --> 00:04:20,719
it's typically held around<font color="#CCCCCC"> Labor Day and</font>

102
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,030
then we have three weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the event</font>

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,190
to wrap up and because it's a Leave No

104
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,349
Trace event that means no trash is

105
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:30,320
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be left on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this side that's</font>

106
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:32,990
everything down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a gum wrapper or an</font>

107
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:36,919
oil spill it's not permitted it's held

108
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:39,740
on federal land BLM land Burning Man

109
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:40,560
provides basically basic life safety

110
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,930
service

111
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,030
if you will so that's things like

112
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:47,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">porta-potties medical care and what i</font>

113
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,530
like to call guardrails so a guardrail

114
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,050
is things like mutual a like law

115
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,510
enforcement they have ice available for

116
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,850
purchase kind of basic necessities but

117
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,460
everything else you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

118
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:01,710
that includes<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own water your own</font>

119
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,630

121
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:09,480
infrastructure you want to bring out

122
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:12,000
there you know everyone sees a city in a

123
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:14,510
different way for me I I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bernie man</font>

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,790
as this diagram has a network diagram

125
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:19,560
everyone has a different view of what a

126
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,630
city looks like sometimes that's a

127
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,360
particular attribute maybe the Eiffel

128
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,550
Tower or the Golden Gate<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bridge</font>

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,010
sometimes it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> street layout for me</font>

130
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,830
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the topology so talk a bit about</font>

131
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,469
quickly the history of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Technology at the</font>

00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:40,139
event<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then how we've scoped up or</font>

134
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,640
couple years so in the beginning around

135
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,520
the mid 90s we had some connectivity

136
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,349
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> before i was attending this was</font>

137
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,570
using old Niedermayer hurts deck

138
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:53,070
equipment that was proprietary and they

139
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically just took a dial-up modem and</font>

140
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:58,110
shot it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the desert bruno's is the</font>

141
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,530
local motel that's in gerlach it's the

142
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:03,660
only motel with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a roughly 100 miles so</font>

143
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,280
there's not a lot of choices there and

144
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,560
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the beginning of some</font>

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,869
limited internet connectivity when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">started to attend was the late 90s and</font>

147
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:14,910
so at<font color="#CCCCCC"> that point we were using different</font>

148
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,460
technologies originally we started off

149
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,289
using ricochet modems ricochet modems a

150
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,700
lot of folks don't know they actually

151
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:23,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a mode where they can talk to each</font>

152
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,440
other without the repeaters they were

153
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,300
quite interesting because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

154
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,860
here megahertz<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 watt modems so you</font>

155
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,720
could literally be in one RV to another

156
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,889
and it just worked and so at that<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

157
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,450
we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to learn anything</font>

158
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,930
about RF engineering it was just

159
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,550
basically standard PPP networking over

160
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,710
time we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to learn a lot more about</font>

161
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:43,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">how antennas work and Link budgets and</font>

162
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:46,349
that sort of thing today it's it's fed

163
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,990
by a local wireless isp he's again

164
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,740
roughly the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only carrier available</font>

165
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,840
when

166
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,190
100 miles so there's not a lot of

167
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,830
opportunities for additional

168
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,719
connectivity there there are some t1

169
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,210
circuits those are also shot via

170
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,940
microwave that phone company was

171
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,039
previously called Nevada belt it's now

172
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,530
subsidiary of AT&T they have four slots

173
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">forty ones they're all taken by the</font>

174
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,650
county and other organizations in town

175
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,750
so that's not even an option<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

176
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,539
there's also no cable so traditionally

177
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're using satellite connectivity and</font>

178
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,789
then in the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple years it's been</font>

179
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,198
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> terrestrial wireless isp and I want to</font>

180
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:23,699
point out here<font color="#CCCCCC"> that obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

181
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,500
numbers are not impressive for this

182
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,509
audience on a purely bandwidth

183
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:29,669
standpoint most of have that amount of

184
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,650
connectivity to our you know our<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

185
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:34,198
handheld or you know in our in our home

186
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,758
but it's impressive because of the

187
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:37,319
location in some of the deployment

188
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,860
characteristics at all I'll walk through

189
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,530
here in the 90s you know Bernie man

190
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:45,870
really saw technology as something that

191
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,719
they weren't really hip to the event was

192
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,770
started by by<font color="#E5E5E5"> artist and so their</font>

193
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,380
background was kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of liberating</font>

194
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,479
themselves from at that time was kind of

195
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,849
multimedia Gulch and the the dot-com

196
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,830
that was being built and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bear at</font>

197
00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:00,539
that point so they they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

198
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:02,639
an escape from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were</font>

199
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,990
expecting or rather they were

200
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,060
experiencing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of kind of NIMBYism</font>

201
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:07,349
meaning you know they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it a</font>

202
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of these art projects in their own</font>

203
00:08:07,349 --> 00:08:10,680
backyard so that's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they</font>

204
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:12,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">started this event is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

205
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:14,370
bring their art in their culture to

206
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:15,780
somewhere where it was welcomed the

207
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:17,880
middle middle of nowhere where there's

208
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:20,969
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of competition vs a San</font>

209
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,919
Francisco or a baker beach and so their

210
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:25,349
use of applications was traditionally

211
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,330
limited to looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> weather when you</font>

212
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:29,610
have a populace at that point of ten to

213
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,189
20,000 a weather event is fairly

214
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,930
significant like if it rains people are

215
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,240
stuck because they can't walk they can't

216
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:38,039
derive if that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens for several days</font>

217
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,409
people may not have brought enough food

218
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:42,449
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pump the porta-potties more</font>

219
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:44,010
often that sort of thing so weather is

220
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:46,440
very important for the organization has

221
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,390
been pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much on stay one they were</font>

222
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,700
also producing a newsletter at that

223
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,319
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> so their use case your internet</font>

224
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,470
was they wanted to build an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email a PDF</font>

225
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">torino pick up some newspapers and bring</font>

226
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,810
them back

227
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,490
haven't printed out and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

228
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,279
was really limited towards those basic

229
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,649
use cases the participants that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

230
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:07,560
attend the event these are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 99</font>

231
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:10,259
percent if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will they had a number of</font>

232
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,878
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting projects so a lot of people</font>

233
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:15,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they think of Bernie man it's it's</font>

234
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:17,220
art cars or parties or raves or grilled

235
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,990
cheese or<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever everyone brings a</font>

236
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,079
different contribution so in my example

237
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,759
I'm not really good at welding and I'm

238
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:26,430
not an artist but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd build networks</font>

239
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,069
and so we began a project called Playa

240
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:30,750
net and ply net is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where was at that</font>

241
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:33,628
point basically internally focused

242
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,490
network so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> had the predecessor over</font>

243
00:09:33,629 --> 00:09:37,110
wiki where we had a directory<font color="#CCCCCC"> of camps</font>

244
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:39,449
that anyone could add the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name of their</font>

245
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,009
camp and location it had an early

246
00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter which was basically</font>

247
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:45,300
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IRC client and the next terminal</font>

248
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:47,730
really basic stuff that's all very

249
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,410
commonplace to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the youth and</font>

250
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,689
young adults would just expect in a

251
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,410
network we were placing there in the

252
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:56,910
late 90s video streaming was was a very

253
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:59,040
interesting application so folks

254
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:01,529
remember things like real video on some

255
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,420
of the earlier video streaming protocols

256
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:05,939
that was stuff that was being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used out</font>

257
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,170
there in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> early 2000s and so</font>

258
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,540
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have these two different</font>

259
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">use cases some of the citizens the</font>

260
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:14,370
participants utilizing the internet for

261
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,470
their art projects or their

262
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,240
contributions to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community and then</font>

263
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,899
the actual organizers that were using

264
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,089
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network for either internal purposes</font>

265
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:26,339
or for external communications so again

266
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,559
this is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different than a lot of the</font>

267
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,660
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> events you might have heard of for</font>

268
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,699
example there's these European hacker

269
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,350
camps that are quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular those</font>

270
00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:36,689
typically you can get 10 gigabits to

271
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:38,910
your tent that's not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of event</font>

272
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:40,920
like burning man so the IP network is

273
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,939
basically a utility here it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the</font>

274
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,750
focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the event so I took a break I</font>

275
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:50,309
took roughly five years off a number of

276
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks tend to do this you get burnt out</font>

277
00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:54,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">it requires potentially several thousand</font>

278
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,430
dollars to go drive out in the desert

279
00:10:54,269 --> 00:10:58,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> build a camp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and have a fun time so</font>

280
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,719
it's easier to do other projects and so

281
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,199
at the time I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> building essentially</font>

282
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,860
my career and meeting folks like Anton

283
00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:08,060
Tony<font color="#CCCCCC"> capela that attends nanog and</font>

284
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,500
you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing things like</font>

285
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,630
community wireless networks and getting

286
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,070
more educated on basically wireless

287
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,290
engineering so again it was a time of

288
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,400
transition where IP network engineers

289
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,040
are learning kind of the background<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

290
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:22,130
RF and vice versa so is very interesting

291
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,860

292
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">network continued to grow pretty</font>

293
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:31,610
substantially during the time that I had

294
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:35,690
left so we had more customers and more

295
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:37,540
more bandwidth that came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the use</font>

296
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,960
case of the network changed dramatically

297
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,610
from when I returned there were several

298
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">departments that Bernie man has</font>

299
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,710
internally one of the most popular<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

300
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,150
critical as an organization called ESD

301
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,910
or the emergency services department

302
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:55,010
they actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an on-site</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hospital</font>

303
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:57,140
vendor and this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

304
00:11:55,010 --> 00:12:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">use case where when people would have</font>

305
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,760
accidents they had a lot of personnel

306
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,280
available they have a full pharmacy

307
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,630
available on site but things like x-rays

308
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,640
were a real challenge and so they'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

309
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,460
to put someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> in an ambulance drive</font>

310
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:12,290
them two hours to Reno get the x-ray for

311
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,240
several hours waiting for that and then

312
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,329
come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the event so it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

313
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,590
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> expensive use case there they</font>

314
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,480
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a vendor that does a</font>

315
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:22,610
remote x-ray technology so they bring an

316
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,170
x-ray machine on site they take the

317
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:28,010
x-ray they send the results over the

318
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,979
network to remote personnel that then

319
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:34,490
read those those readings they do that

320
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,530
for other<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hospital applications too we</font>

321
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,690
also serve as as the peace app for the

322
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,459
region this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the FCC</font>

323
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:42,710
gentlemen will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be aware of a piece app</font>

324
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:44,630
as a public<font color="#CCCCCC"> safety answering point it's</font>

325
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:48,440
essentially where your 911 calls go to

326
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,170
so for ESD the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is very critical</font>

327
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,540
they also run their own two-way radio

328
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a number of those</font>

329
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,410
motorola radios like you would see from

330
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,790
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> police department so that's that's</font>

331
00:12:57,410 --> 00:13:01,670
through some of their major functions

332
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:05,180
that do we overlap with the city has its

333
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,339
own DPW Department of Public Works so

334
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:08,630
these are volunteers that build the<font color="#E5E5E5"> city</font>

335
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,720
so this is everything from a shade

336
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:13,529
structure to signage<font color="#CCCCCC"> to basic plumbing</font>

337
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,540
like building the fence around the event

338
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:17,939
that sort of thing they have a number of

339
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,259
subsidiary departments one that we work

340
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:21,149
with pretty heavily is called heavy

341
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:24,060
machinery that an entire power

342
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:27,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">department power there is pretty</font>

343
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">substantial typically by the map that</font>

344
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over the last couple years</font>

345
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:34,229
you're seeing roughly about 1.5

346
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,149
megawatts of power at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the site so there</font>

347
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">are a number of generator systems that</font>

348
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:41,699
folks bring out for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> organization's</font>

349
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,399
those are fed from the large semi trucks

350
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:47,040
of generators and a lot of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> camps</font>

351
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,809
they'll bring out like a 75 or a 50 KW

352
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,339
generator that's that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> unheard of</font>

353
00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:53,999
those are those are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> popular out</font>

354
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:56,339
there as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the applications</font>

355
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,480
have grown pretty substantially a lot of

356
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have moved to cloud-based</font>

357
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,220
applications so in the mid-2000s it was

358
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,559
very popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> for organizations to have</font>

359
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,540
their own my sequel server or their own

360
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,519
FileMaker server on site some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

361
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:10,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">has moved to cloud-based applications</font>

362
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:12,180
particularly around<font color="#E5E5E5"> Personnel Management</font>

363
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,758
<font color="#CCCCCC">she liked shift scheduling that sort of</font>

364
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,620
thing again Public Safety is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strong</font>

365
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:20,129
component of the event so they have

366
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,889
their own FM station that broadcasts

367
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:25,589
public safety information like for

368
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:27,629
example the city<font color="#CCCCCC"> range early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on Monday</font>

369
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:30,779
this year and so they were giving

370
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:33,839
guidelines around folks to not leave

371
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:35,430
their camp and to stay calm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

372
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,199
know the Sun will come up and it will

373
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:39,930
dry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be fine and that that was</font>

374
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,449
the case so they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that for streaming</font>

375
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:45,420
out to folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again other departments</font>

376
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:46,949
there is a DMV at Burning Man it's not

377
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,040
called a Department of Motor Vehicles

378
00:14:46,949 --> 00:14:52,680
it's the department of mutant vehicles

379
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,599
so DMV actually registers art cars so

380
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,819
our cars get a license<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a daytime or</font>

381
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,240
nighttime operation they have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

382
00:14:56,819 --> 00:15:02,969
various signage lighting the driver has

383
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,699
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be sober etc so they have pretty</font>

384
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:07,889
strict definitions there there yet

385
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:09,689
another customer the network commissary

386
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:12,149
you have thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of volunteers we have</font>

387
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:13,589
to feed that volunteer populace is very

388
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:16,139
dynamic so they place an order with

389
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,790
their food vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day and multiple</font>

390
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:21,480
semi trucks coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and out with</font>

391
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:23,160
that that food and beverage ticketing is

392
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,080
also really important<font color="#CCCCCC"> ticketing is all</font>

393
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,670
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the cloud but we have multiple</font>

394
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,200
eat grasses<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ticketing we have a main</font>

395
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,900
gate we have a gate next<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the airport</font>

396
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,970
the airport has its own<font color="#CCCCCC"> FAA designation</font>

397
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,520
right so it's a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> city it's not just</font>

398
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:38,430
a festival<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the middle of nowhere it's</font>

399
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,750
it's an actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> functioning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City so some</font>

400
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,750
some visuals here that might be

401
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:46,230
interesting ESD they have a number of

402
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,910
compounds or buildings that they form as

403
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:49,440
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here the large antenna tower</font>

404
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,089
is where they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their trunked</font>

405
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,570
radio system they're there to<font color="#E5E5E5"> weigh</font>

406
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:56,460
system the other portable room towards

407
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,410
the left side there's or their dispatch

408
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,030
center so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a number of consoles</font>

409
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,430
again just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have in any</font>

410
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,170
normal<font color="#CCCCCC"> city all of their equipment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

411

actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> staged in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Reno and work on a</font>

412
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,729
year-round get it tuned and then during

413
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">the event time they come out a few</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font>

414
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,700
before just bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all the racks read</font>

415
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,110
cable and power it back on the one of

416
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:18,540
the department's i mentioned heavy

417
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:20,940
machinery has a number of as you can

418
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine heavy machines to operate so</font>

419
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,020
these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like scissor lifts boom</font>

420
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,010
lifts forklifts heisters light towers

421
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:31,020
forklifts you name it lots of lifts

422
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,060
typically these can do anywhere from a

423
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,579
couple you know hundred pounds to

424
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:38,699
usually up to 50,000 pounds so a lot of

425
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:41,370
art and infrastructure requires this

426
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:43,110
machinery to operate and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

427
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,460
thankful that they have the boom lift so

428
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:46,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have to climb 60-foot</font>

429
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:49,830
towers they can just point us up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

430
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">tower and we can aim</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our equipment so</font>

431
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,860
the apartment that runs this

432
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:54,180
infrastructure is called the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IITs group</font>

433
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,340
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> services</font>

434
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,560
group and we're essentially the IT

435
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,510
department for the entire organization

436
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,449
so we're serving those departments like

437
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:05,160
the DMV<font color="#E5E5E5"> arctica media Mecca cafe that</font>

438
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,780
sort of thing some of the larger

439
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,970
departments like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ESDA rangers have their</font>

440
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,670
own IT staff but overall we're kind of

441
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,680
the folks people come to<font color="#CCCCCC"> michigan again</font>

442
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,930
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything from my printer is not</font>

443
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,120
working or my database is corrupted<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

444
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:21,450
I need more bandwidth or<font color="#CCCCCC"> need static IP</font>

445
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,919
so it's pretty varied a lot of folks

446
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:25,530
assume that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we sit in an</font>

447
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,610
air-conditioned room all weekend it's

448
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:31,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the luxury style event</font>

449
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:33,678
for us that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the case it has</font>

450
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,970
it been<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for several years so a lot</font>

451
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,830
of new volunteers are kind of shocked

452
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,960
they assume oh we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get to sit in</font>

453
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:40,220
like a data center equivalent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wildly</font>

454
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,410
do have rooms that are air-conditioned

455
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,049
and comfortable most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our time is</font>

456
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">spent particularly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at layer 1 and 8 so a</font>

457
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:49,190
lot of physical attributes we have to do

458
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,720
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in grounding rods it's not like a</font>

459
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,660
cola where there's a grounding bus you

460
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,100
have to build<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus right you have to</font>

461
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:57,080
get the IP which means you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

462
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:58,639
the power there the power is not there

463
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:00,439
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Department</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

464
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,520
now you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the power there you need</font>

465
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do the trenching well you don't</font>

468
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:09,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time spent organizing getting</font>

469
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:15,110
this infrastructure built it's not just

470
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:17,120
us doing these installations gorilla so

471
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,439
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I came back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the event I kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

472
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,120
focused on some of the lessons I had

473
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">learned essentially in the real world</font>

474
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of this can be based</font>

475
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,290
off of kind of traditional either six

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,260
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to call it but</font>

478
00:18:28,669 --> 00:18:32,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's essentially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this process of</font>

479
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,240
observing kind of the initial state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

480
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:37,220
how the team is functioning and in

481
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:38,660
revising that with some changes and in

482
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:41,270
revisiting that so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

483
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:43,760
constant agile approach of how do we

484
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:45,220
make things better incrementally so when

485
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">I came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back you know a lot of these</font>

486
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,620
departments were being served with a

487
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:50,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">network that had a lot of problems with</font>

488
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">it we had a large layer to</font>

489
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,809
infrastructure part of that was due to

490
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,209
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment that we had wasn't</font>

491
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:59,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-funded so it was literally no old</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Linux pcs or bsd pcs at 2am LOL card</font>

493
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,200
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great for community wireless</font>

494
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,940
network but not a network that had to

495
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,700
act on kind of a carrier-grade fashion

496
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:10,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">NAT was becoming a problem as more</font>

497
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">departments are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run applications we</font>

498
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,879
had effectively two different business

499
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,200
units we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this legacy these</font>

500
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,850
are the participants that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of built</font>

501
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,990
their own thing and then we have these

502
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,189
departments which seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be growing</font>

503
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,740
and growing you want to run more

504
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:23,870
application so we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> serving these two</font>

505
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,730
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users pretty differently</font>

506
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,918
on both the service we were delivering

507
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,169
them and the approach in terms of the

508
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,630
management delivering them that that

509
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,340
service a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of configuration was</font>

510
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,130
manual so you had that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of triple</font>

511
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,449
typical tribal knowledge effect which is

512
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,040
very detrimental to a lot of

513
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,770
organizations especially when you're

514
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,570
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring new</font>

515
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,910
volunteers on every year or there's

516
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:47,580
turnover monitoring was obviously a big

517
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:50,730
problem single points of failure are a

518
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,830
particular issue for us power we don't

519
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,660
necessarily control power outages do

520
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,179
happen tanks don't necessarily get

521
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:01,170
refilled if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> rains and they can't</font>

522
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:03,150
deliver the gas for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if there's a</font>

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:06,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical issue where the tower gets run</font>

524
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,470
over whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case may be there's a</font>

525
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,580
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times where we can't</font>

526
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:10,530
make everything as we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to as</font>

527
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,199
we'd like to and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> most</font>

528
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">importantly is staff burnout all the</font>

529
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,500
folks that run the network are

530
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,390
volunteers so we're there<font color="#E5E5E5"> there attend</font>

531
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,380
the event and it doesn't make sense if

532
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,910
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build this network and</font>

533
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,160
then have to work during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the week of the</font>

534
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:26,970
event so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was something that I tried</font>

535
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,990
to address as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we could so we</font>

536
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,790
looked at this in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple different</font>

537
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,860
ways one is you know by creating a

538
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:33,870
unified team it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really helpful for</font>

539
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,909
us particular in the RF side we were

540
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,199
starting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run out of spectrum most of</font>

541
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,700
the links were using<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're on license</font>

542
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,830
and so to be able to coordinate that was

543
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,770
really helpful we actually hold an event

544
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,929
every year in San Francisco we were

545
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,180
invited any RF users of Burning Man to

546
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,670
participate so this is typically folks

547
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,950
art projects zig bees were really

548
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,900
popular about two years ago drones of

549
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:56,370
the new pop another thing so we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

550
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,050
coordinate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> other large users a</font>

551
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,389
spectrum regardless if it's licensed

552
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:04,200
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlicensed just so that we can</font>

553
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:06,720
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some visibility into that other</font>

554
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,730
main thing is coordinating IP addresses

555
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,770
as you can imagine getting a lot of your

556
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,080
own unique IP space for a temporary

557
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,879
event is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not easy and so we had a lot of</font>

558
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,970
layers of<font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT so coordinating the users</font>

559
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">of NAT was was very important for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I</font>

560
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">think one of the founding was that we</font>

561
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:25,020
had a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technologies in place</font>

562
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,960
that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand-built so you know we had</font>

563
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,310
the the so Chris boards and we had the

564
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,260
homemade you know Debbie and boxes and

565
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,639
whatnot then that was great because it

566
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,560
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a couple hundred dollars and</font>

567
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,810
applied really well for a kind of

568
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:39,629
homemade networks but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't really</font>

569
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:41,820
scalable for a team that had knowledge

570
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was more mainstream so we wanted it</font>

571
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:46,200
to be basically anyone off the street

572
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,720
can be applicable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> managing the</font>

573
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,930
network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we bought what my father</font>

574
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,180
would like to call cots equipment or

575
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,500

576
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,860

anything you would normally have and

579
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,699
then we standardize the service offering

580
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,260
so we wanted to be very<font color="#CCCCCC"> consistent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

581
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,060

584
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:16,580
mechanism is and for participants we do

00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:19,550
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a self install provisioning so</font>

586
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:20,600
again a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of layer 2 previously so we</font>

587
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:22,669
made a rule that we're going to route

588

always if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want large layer to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and a participant can route between each</font>

596
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,450
other we continue to do segmentation as

597
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,610
much as we can so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example we'll run</font>

598
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,170
a VLAN trunk to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> access point and an</font>

599
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,659
each station will listen to a particular

600
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,610
VLAN tag so as best as we can we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

601
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:54,440
segment as much as we can with the

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:55,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">equipment we have available and then on</font>

603
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,560
the automation front we started

604
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,260
initially with routers and switches and

605
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:02,270
then we grew over time they said doesn't

606
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,910
happen overnight<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever you know over</font>

607
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:07,129
several years we've increased the

608
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:10,310
automation framework I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

609
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:13,160
came home this past year where one of

610
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:15,770
our volunteers is actually here at nanog

611
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,380
Ralph meulen<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralph can stand up here for</font>

612
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:21,379
a second here Ralph did the presentation

613
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,630
the last night about some of his

614
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,360
telemetry<font color="#CCCCCC"> t does the near an archive but</font>

615
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:28,640
he also is one of the main volunteers

616
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,959
for the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Burning Man and I</font>

617
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,520
think he made a really good quote where

618
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,410
he was able to come to the event a

619
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,720
couple weeks before sorry a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font>

620
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,040
before everyone else and immediately be

621
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,510
effective you know because the

622
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,460
automation framework was very useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

623
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:41,870
could just jump in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start going I</font>

624
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,830
didn't have to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of training</font>

625
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,810
time so we on the participants I'd

626
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,760
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> formulate kind of a ghetto</font>

627
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,899
docsis if you will one of the things

628
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's interesting about a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bic whaty</font>

629
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,980
equipment is that it ships looking for a

630
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,630
station<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry looking for an access</font>

631
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:59,060
point so it's configured as a station

632
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,090
from the factory it looks for an access

633
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:04,530
point called ubnt so conveniently we

634
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,449
beacon an access point called ubnt

635
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,010
it's a factory default state we know

636
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,900
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the credentials are so we can log</font>

637
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,460
into it so the very first thing we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

638
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,080
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it to a parking IP because</font>

639
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,730
conveniently that I'll come with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

640
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,860
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address so we move it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

641
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:18,840
temporary IP address and we push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

642
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,790
firmware when we push it a config and

643
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">then if anyone connects to that from</font>

644
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:24,240
their camp they go through a captive

645
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,610
portal process where record basically

646
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,170
their email address against their mac

647
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:29,939
address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then their physical street</font>

648
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,320
the reason we do that is because a lot

649
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,940
of times people will mount equipment it

650
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,980
will slowly degrade because they

651
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,440
zip-tied it to an RV<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it doesn't</font>

652
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,030
really necessarily handle the win really

653
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,770
well so we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build to escalate to</font>

654
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,230
them but this entire process is

655
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,330
self-serve where previously they would

656
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to chase down some engineer and get</font>

657
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,189
configured where now it's completely

658
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,690
self-serve originally one of the route

659
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,610
put together it was really awesome was

660
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,930
the predecessor to this where you would

661
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:56,639
buy this equipment you would come to

662
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">center camp and there was an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet</font>

container with a little monitor

665
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,850
scrolling by and so you basically

666
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,440
brought your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vic whaty station and you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">would see on the right side there so</font>

it's just a small nano bridge and tip

00:26:25,109 --> 00:26:28,739
time my day job had a good price with

709

requirements of being fanless an active

711
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:37,499
p OE and an operating system that

712

allowed some level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of automation so it</font>

those are just layer two bridges we

and so the main location<font color="#CCCCCC"> in town is</font>

720
00:26:54,569 --> 00:26:57,719
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Garlock that's the city of</font>

721
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:59,999
burlock that's where our wireless isp

722
00:26:57,719 --> 00:27:01,499
hands off he stops at the town and we

723
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:03,209
have to do another 50 miles out to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

724
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:05,249
playa so we shoot to two different

725
00:27:03,209 --> 00:27:07,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">locations one of them is the knock the</font>

726
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">other is the depot the reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for that</font>

727
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:11,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">is timing so the depot gets billed as a</font>

728
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,289
staging or logistics area for the

729
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,569
department of<font color="#E5E5E5"> public works so that tower</font>

730
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:17,639
gets installed almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> immediately and</font>

731
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:19,139
it's powered by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a light tower so before</font>

732
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:20,998
anyone camps out there before<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

733
00:27:19,139 --> 00:27:22,769
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> building out there there's a</font>

734
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:24,689
tower in internet so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

735
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:26,609
critical for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them for logistics reasons</font>

736
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:28,799
and then the NOC is kind of our central

737
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:30,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">distribution point we basically separate</font>

738
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,459
these out where departments typically

739
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect to the depot and participants</font>

740
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:37,319
typically connect to the NOC again some

741
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:39,089
visuals here so if you're afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

742
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:41,489
heights probably not the best team to

743
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:44,639
volunteer for we spend a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time on</font>

744
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:47,279
boom lifts and it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be several hours</font>

745
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:49,918
of aiming and crimping cables and

746
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,359
getting everything to work again another

as a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network so all of our trenches</font>

proper carrier and again another visual

<font color="#CCCCCC">just a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> small little shack with a</font>

760
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:21,959
tower there's a router and a switch

761
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:24,719
there and on a server for some of our

762
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:26,699
monitoring you may notice if you're

763
00:28:24,719 --> 00:28:28,739
looking at the the PDF we're a little

764
00:28:26,699 --> 00:28:29,650
bit closer there is um some<font color="#CCCCCC"> lightning</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">arrester Zahl</font>

766
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,840
so everything is protected from

767
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,729
lightning events so again going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font>

768
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that backbone picture where you saw</font>

770
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:43,300
represented with kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

771
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:44,800
distribution layer so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you</font>

772
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,360
know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple routers located in them</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and in various sector eyes panel</font>

774
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:50,530
antennas or sometimes an omni antenna so

775
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:52,300
what we do is we build<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things</font>

776
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:54,340
called islands and so an island is

777
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:56,379
basically serving multiple departments

778
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,550
with two different wireless links so

779
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,010
they connect to these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

780
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,629
redundant locations and then we hand off

781
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:03,760
a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wired connections as best as</font>

782
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:06,190
we can we find this is more efficient

783
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,800
for variety of reasons one it has kind

784
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:10,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">of a shared faith and it builds around</font>

785
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,040
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the principles of Burning Man</font>

786
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,750
which is when this thing loses power a

787
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:16,690
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people get affected in so</font>

788
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,270
they're motivated to fix that other

789
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:22,420
reasons are for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> just redundant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sea</font>

790
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,580
and efficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the RF spectrum if</font>

791
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,220
every department had their own RF radio

792
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,169
we would quickly overwhelm the access

793
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,360
points so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to be as efficient as</font>

794
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,250
we can and in some cases will use like

795
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">peavy extenders and whatnot to go beyond</font>

796
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,500
the standard limitations of copper

797
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">ethernet the two different differences</font>

798
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,340
sorry the two differences here are

799
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,290
theirs for sector panels in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

800
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,730
cap knock locate location that's

801
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:48,040
typically where camps or participants

802
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:50,740
connect to and then there's a single

803
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,480
sector antenna an omni at the depot so

804
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:56,080
slightly different ways of distributing

805
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,270
content there again<font color="#CCCCCC"> close-up of</font>

lightning<font color="#CCCCCC"> arresters like I said there's</font>

807
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:01,150
not a lightning bar or lightning

812
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,170
ground ourselves and then wire up all

the light<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting but it's also a</font>

814
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:16,360
24-7 operation so we were fully on call

815
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,490
all the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the problem we actually</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">have a bucket truck in our department</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">ubiquity calls us the Nano beans now</font>

821
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,570
they have a slightly different product

822
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:34,300
and then you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a demarcation of a</font>

823
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:36,370
typically switch or router nice things

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that particular product line is</font>

825

the configs are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

whether it's what's a router or switch

827
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:45,600
and for us again since we only do nap

828
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,769
when we demarcate in gerlach these

829
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">things are pretty much just routing</font>

830
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:51,149
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT functionality required</font>

831
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,639
again you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a close up here this</font>

832
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:55,649
there's a fiber pitcher or there's some

833
00:30:53,639 --> 00:30:57,719
fiber cables in this picture that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was an</font>

work<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so well so automation this is</font>

843
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:20,519
the the hip buzz word these days so

844
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:23,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally we had a bunch of homegrown</font>

845
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,649
scripts originally Ralph had worked on

846
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:28,439
representing the network as a faceless

847
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:30,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">csv file that was fed into nagios for</font>

848
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,409
generating the nagios config and he

849
00:31:30,029 --> 00:31:32,610
extended that so what had you known

850
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:35,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aggie owes things like x and y</font>

851
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,899
coordinates for the the map but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also had</font>

852
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:38,699
parent-child relationships and IP

853
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,320
schemes and that sort of thing and we

854
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:41,580
kind of built upon<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so one year we</font>

855
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">try just kind of putting everything</font>

856
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,820
represented as the animal file and we

857
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:46,980
built various scripts you know want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

858
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,990
generate forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and one for reverse</font>

859
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,700
DNS 14 switch config zaman for outer

860
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:52,889
configs and there wasn't really scaling

861
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,600
so well so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ended up doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically a</font>

862
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:56,309
bake-off where we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it needs to be</font>

863
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,029
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's open source and</font>

864
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:01,740
easy to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it needs to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be something</font>

865
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:04,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be embraced by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the team where</font>

866
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,539
we have different knowledge sets so some

867
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our team members ever in rfcs and</font>

868
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:09,480
some of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the first time they've</font>

869
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,950
crimped a cable so needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be something</font>

870
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,529
that's that's usable by that that

871
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,629
diverse background so we ended up<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

872
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:17,490
something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> ncg that's called a</font>

873
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:19,439
network configuration generator this

874
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,210
actually been presented at nanog several

875
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,659
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the gentleman who wrote</font>

876
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,830
this software his playa name is domo he

877
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:30,629
also wrote some software called

878
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:32,580
majordomo and so he was fortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

879
00:32:30,629 --> 00:32:34,320
to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> member of our team so of course</font>

880
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,789
if it's something that he wrote then

881
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,950
he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support it so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

882
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:40,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">principle developer put most of our</font>

883
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:41,519
configs and converted into n GG format

884
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:42,869
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would say that you know the</font>

885
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,929
learning curve was fairly steep

886
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:48,720
initially but as that presentation shows

887
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:51,059
from nan on 49 the workflow he preached

888
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,909
is totally possible of essentially

889
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:56,190
architects building a template or kind

890
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:57,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a universal design and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an operators</font>

891
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:58,919
are not personnel kind of rinsing and

892
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,049
repeating you know filling out some

893
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:04,710
variables and adding customers as needed

894
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:07,470
so it's totally<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible so the way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

895
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,320
laid that out is through three major

896
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:12,690
input files so you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like</font>

897
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,360
the site name what type of hardware it

898
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,879
is does it have a static IP address or

899
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,668
is it just some something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 1918</font>

900
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:22,529
space things like is it what type of

901
00:33:20,669 --> 00:33:23,700
interface is a bound to because

902
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:25,379
interfaces are a little bit different

903
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,629
for us right if you're at an island<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

904
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:29,309
demarcation is that routed port on that

905
00:33:27,629 --> 00:33:31,619
switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you may be a participant</font>

906
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:33,509
where you're going over some wireless

907
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:35,399
infrastructure so<font color="#E5E5E5"> your demarcation is a</font>

908
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:36,629
layer to bridge in your camp so there's

909
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:38,908
a couple different configurations that

910
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:41,428
we offer so again these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> just these</font>

911
00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:43,080
are flat files and I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in a table</font>

912
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:45,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">here to make them a little more legible</font>

913
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:48,750
then there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans file so you've got</font>

914
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:50,490
a unique VLAN ID again a description a

915
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:51,990
category we use a category for

916
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:53,909
monitoring purposes you know who's using

917
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,700
more bandwidth is that the participants

918
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:58,799
or is it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> departments historically it</font>

919
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,539
was the participants this year was

920
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,769
definitely the<font color="#CCCCCC"> departments so it's</font>

921
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:04,769
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use to break down</font>

922
00:34:01,769 --> 00:34:06,240
monitoring data where that VLAN is<font color="#CCCCCC"> plumb</font>

923
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:09,389
to and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again what type of configuration</font>

924
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,599
are we offering and who's serving up dtp

925
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:14,429
an interesting problem we found is that

926
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,889
while the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper devices do support</font>

927
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:19,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">DHCP when they receive a number of</font>

928
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,510
requests for dhcp they just stopped

929
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:24,089
responding<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

930
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:26,490
running so that's kind of a bummer so

931
00:34:24,089 --> 00:34:30,089
this basic field is where we can say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

932
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:33,928
we want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dhp relay the IP</font>

933
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:35,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">address is derived from the VLAN ID so</font>

934
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:40,560
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> use like the third octet will be</font>

935
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:42,480
the the 1918 space we would use for that

936
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,639
particular feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> segment and there's</font>

937
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,440
a static IP address or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Republic routable</font>

938
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,549
IP address that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can override so</font>

939
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,810
that's the last field that you see

940
00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:54,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">Entergy's built off a ruby so it uses</font>

941
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:56,730
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> yarby templates if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone's</font>

942
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">familiar with that template language it</font>

943
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:01,619
should look fairly familiar so we've got

944
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,030
it basically a string completion we've

945
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:04,619
got something keyed off of the model

946
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:06,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and then an array we're just</font>

947
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:08,579
looping<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as a key value</font>

948
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:11,879
it gets a little more complicated very

949
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:14,820
quickly here so here we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> some DGP</font>

950
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:16,170
enumerate<font color="#E5E5E5"> where enumerate in dtp so</font>

951
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:19,770
again we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like you</font>

952
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,810
know if the VLAN ID you know pull from

953
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:25,109
the third octet and then we know what

954
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:27,509
the IP space is if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DGP source is set</font>

955
00:35:25,109 --> 00:35:30,420
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateway then generate this config on</font>

956
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,820
this gateway if it sets at HPD then

957
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,890
adjust it so that it's pointed to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhp</font>

958
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">relay server so one of things that's</font>

959
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:39,118
interesting about ncg is that some of

960
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:42,810
the logic or a lot of the logic actually

961
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,220
falls in the template itself and again

962
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:46,290
we started initially with just doing

963
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,270
routers and switches but<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we have</font>

964
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:50,400
this doing forward and reverse DNS all

965
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:53,430
of our wireless station and access point

966
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,660
configs smoke paying our ID tool pretty

967
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:57,839
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything we don't configure</font>

968
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,578
anything by hand essentially what the

969
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,619
process is is that you make the change

970
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:05,010
you check it in to get whatever you

971
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:07,230
change and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you type make deploy so as</font>

972
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:09,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can see here we've got 286 configs</font>

973
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:11,970
that they come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this again this</font>

974
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,618
was crucial to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to scale I'm not</font>

975
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:16,020
under the network itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the teams</font>

976
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,869
the people could attend the event a not

977
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,640
get very<font color="#E5E5E5"> frustrated weeks before as they</font>

978
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:22,050
spent all their time configuring there's

979
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,270
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other things that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

980
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,010
accomplish before the event and doing

981
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:29,430
any sort of configuration by hand is not

982
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:30,810
one of them so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

983
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,450
other lessons that we learned you know

984
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,369
2.4 as I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the operators in</font>

985
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:36,810
this room will understand is is

986
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:40,079
basically completely unusable you know

987
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:41,970
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us people don't bring their their</font>

988
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,890
shiniest you know iphone 6 to Burning

989
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:46,290
Man right they bring the road linksys or

990
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:48,270
their whole you know virus infested

991
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,680
laptop that sort of thing so it's not

992
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:51,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">always the best equipment they bring out</font>

993
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,078
there so 2.4 is completely unusable for

994
00:36:51,869 --> 00:36:57,780
us we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> used that for several</font>

995
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">years now drones use that for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> video</font>

996
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:02,099
downlink you see video cameras that sort

997
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,900
of thing another<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting thing is</font>

998
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:05,609
again because people bring older

999
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:08,010
technology out there that's not

1000
00:37:05,609 --> 00:37:09,509
necessarily patched up or as a previous

1001
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,829
configuration is that we completely

1002
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:16,170
avoid 1918 we use an RFC called 65 98

1003
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:17,000
which is a / 10 that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not allowed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1004
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:18,920
routed on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

1005
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,680
and it's for service providers to use

1006
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,480
and we are the service provider and this

1007
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,330
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is very useful it gives us a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lot more IP space and it's very clear</font>

1009
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:30,830
when a customer comes to us and says hey

1010

I'm having<font color="#E5E5E5"> some problems with 192 168 we</font>

1013
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,390
very nice clear demarcation as I

the network is fully routed on the

personnel side I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think one of the</font>

1018
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,130
lessons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've really learned is</font>

1019
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:50,990
that we're treating the network more as

1020
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:53,690
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a software project if you</font>

1022
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:58,520
those configs every year to add more

1025
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,210

Burning Man multiple pages in fact and

1029
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:14,089
we have an on-call rotation there's a

1030
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,130

1031
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,990
the network in some ways a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little too</font>

00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,400
efficient where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we again we're not</font>

1041
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,040
redundant we have multiple sites that

people connect to we have multiple

1044
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,629
cleaned up with as much as we can at the

single point of failure in town to pick

1047
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:51,430
up our IP and unfortunately IP is is

1048
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:54,770
quite expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there you know in in</font>

1049

the rural parts of America there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1052
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:01,600
that's still the case it's been that way

1053
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,710
for quite some time in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1054
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,500
significantly cheaper than what the lek

1055
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:09,260
was offering us so our next provider

1056
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,940
choices is literally 180 miles away so

1057
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:13,730
we're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process of building some</font>

1058
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,710
wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> links to reach these other</font>

1059
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,140
providers because we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1060
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:19,850
infrastructure that's as more redundant

1061
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,100
as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

1062
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:23,420
coordinating with you know five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> six</font>

1063
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:25,400
different agencies that own that

1064
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">mountain top and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put in power on it and</font>

1065
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,270
getting a network plumbed back to Reno

1066
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,470
so it's a huge<font color="#CCCCCC"> undertaking</font>

1067
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:33,330
so I but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> personally been working on</font>

1068
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,649
for about three years now it's it's it's

1069
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:36,270
not something will happen overnight so

1070
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,670
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very different in the data center</font>

1071
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:40,800
that's that's a cross connect away

1072
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:42,840
recently there's a small exchange that

1073
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,630
started up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tahoe Reno area called</font>

1074
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,760
tau YX there are a few providers we'd

1075
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:50,220
love to see join that will probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1076
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,680
connecting to that and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course for</font>

1077
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> martin levy here ipv6 is something</font>

1078
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,339
that that we were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a</font>

1079
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,840
little more seriously so last year we

1080
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,870
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use a tunnel from hurricane</font>

1081
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:03,600
electric at the time our upstream was

1082
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,310
only single home to sprint and so the

1083
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:07,160
performance was less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than optimal I</font>

1084
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:10,560
would say from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tunneling perspective</font>

1085
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:13,290
that upstream provider has been educated

1086
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:19,110
as in he gave me logins and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed his</font>

1087
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:21,090
network so his network now uses ssh in

1088
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:24,870
our ins bgp in ospf and all that good

1089
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:26,700
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> so because of that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

1090
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:30,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">errand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> log in now i'm actually one of</font>

1091
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:32,490
his his contacts and so i applied for v6

1092
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:35,280
and he took<font color="#E5E5E5"> it seriously and and he's</font>

1093
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:40,410
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> dual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still stacked so he's he's</font>

1094
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,720
multihomed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe I'm quest level</font>

1095
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:45,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">three and sprint and so he's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been really</font>

1096
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,740
supportive of us even though he's a

1097
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">little expensive he's our only choice</font>

1098
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:53,750
but he's been a real partner and

1099
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:57,270
increasing the network's capability and

1100
00:40:53,750 --> 00:41:00,270
again down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the road you know we expected</font>

1101
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">to reach capacity as more these</font>

1102
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:05,910
applications were more relevant to the

1103
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:08,399
organization and this year was an

1104
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,350
interesting experience for us we've had

1105
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,080
our own IP space from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron for two</font>

1106
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:15,420
years and we used that sparsely as we

1107
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:18,150
can you know not every iphone again<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1108
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,140
the playa needs a public IP address but

1109
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:21,030
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of projects that do a</font>

1110
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:22,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of folks that bring out you know</font>

1111
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,760
database servers and other

1112
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,560
infrastructure that it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful</font>

1113
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,730
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but one of things that's</font>

1114
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,770
interesting is because we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own</font>

1115
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:30,810
IP space we get our you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I get the</font>

1116
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,370
emails for the takedown notices and dmca

1117
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:34,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that sort of thing and so was</font>

1118
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:36,180
interesting for me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know in</font>

1119
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:38,190
the past we had one or two where we'd

1120
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,990
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trickle of notifications of</font>

1121
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,940
something was being downloaded you know

1122
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:43,379
a Showtime or HBO show or something like

1123
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,069
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was typically during the</font>

1124
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,920
event

1125
00:41:44,069 --> 00:41:49,709
but now we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that pre-event we also</font>

1126
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,630
get it for adult content so whatever our

1127
00:41:49,709 --> 00:41:53,430
users<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing their pain well seen out</font>

1128
00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,229
there as downloading lots lots of

1129
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,910
content and so capacity is a real big

1130
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:59,129
problem for us it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like we can just</font>

1131
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:00,719
add more appearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> atom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or transit or</font>

1132
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:02,640
whatever there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just none available</font>

1133
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:05,219
within 100 miles so it's a real problem

1134
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,959
for us to add capacity to the network

1135
00:42:05,219 --> 00:42:09,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's something that we we've been</font>

1136
00:42:06,959 --> 00:42:10,680
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve upon and this year was</font>

1137
00:42:09,449 --> 00:42:12,479
one of the first years where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1138
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,879
had to strongly consider some sort of

1139
00:42:12,479 --> 00:42:16,430
IDP or traffic shaping and saying well

1140
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,809
certain services would be blocked

1141
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:20,459
there's no charge for their own access

1142
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:21,839
for any of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> departments there's no</font>

1143
00:42:20,459 --> 00:42:24,538
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill back you'd see in a typical</font>

1144
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:26,549
organization and there's no charge to

1145
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:27,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> participants and so it's something</font>

1146
00:42:26,549 --> 00:42:30,089
that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do we</font>

1147
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,890
tackle this problem without you know

1148
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,719
blocking services that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't</font>

1149
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:35,219
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into that game the other</font>

1150
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:37,279
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network automation side</font>

1151
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:40,380
i mean i think automation is a really

1152
00:42:37,279 --> 00:42:42,390
strong incentive to make your team and

1153
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,390
your product scale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wanted to spend</font>

1154
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot more time talking about that today</font>

1155
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:48,538
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think the overall background on</font>

1156
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:50,190
story was a little more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1157
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:52,199
folks one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we're</font>

1158
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:54,269
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on is looking at tools like</font>

1159
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:57,299
ansible ansible is kind of interesting

1160
00:42:54,269 --> 00:42:59,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's very flexible in what the</font>

1161
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:01,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">input data mechanism is so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I wrote a</font>

1162
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:04,349
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python scripts to take the</font>

1163
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:06,109
standard ncg input formats convert it to

1164
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:08,759
yamo and it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just kind of works within</font>

1165
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:10,249
ansibles templating framework so that's

1166
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:12,479
something we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at because</font>

1167
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:14,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">ncg has been really great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us but</font>

1168
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:16,288
there's literally one developer and one

1169
00:43:14,069 --> 00:43:18,719
main user we'd like to use some software

1170
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:23,819
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has a larger community as best</font>

1171
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:25,799
as we can and last useful slide here

1172
00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:28,440
again kind of summarizing some of the

1173
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:29,670
lessons we learned over the the 10 plus

1174
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,979
years that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this out in</font>

1175
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:34,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">the desert is again automation is really</font>

1176
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:36,419
key start with something simple you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1177
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:38,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether that's generating DNS configs or</font>

1178
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,959
maybe it's just your switch configs now

1179
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:40,859
pick something and start from there

1180
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:43,348
you're never going to automate

1181
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:47,369
everything from day one it's also

1182
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:48,809
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to visualize essentially what</font>

1183
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:50,160
some of the other output mechanisms will

1184
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:52,170
be you know billing for us is not

1185
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,578
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do but monitoring is</font>

1186
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:55,049
something really<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful so that for</font>

1187
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:57,029
that's that was kind of an afterthought

1188
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,950
so we added things like that category

1189
00:43:57,029 --> 00:44:00,299
designation

1190
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:02,640
single source of truth is incredibly

1191
00:44:00,299 --> 00:44:04,349
powerful this is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> from kind of</font>

1192
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,960
the DevOps revolution that system mins

1193
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:08,579
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> lurd decades ago but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

1194
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,200
network engineers are still coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

1195
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,719
speed with this is that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1196
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,749
necessarily have to buy a super fancy

1197
00:44:12,719 --> 00:44:17,190
ipam management software but you know

1198
00:44:15,749 --> 00:44:19,950
floating around that Excel spreadsheet

1199
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:21,690
is not scalable so for us we put

1200
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,189
everything and get and what's great

1201
00:44:21,690 --> 00:44:24,900
about get is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's a distributed</font>

1202
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,369
offline database for us right so when

1203
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,989
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> an employment we've already</font>

1204
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:30,329
have a check out we can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> our changes</font>

1205
00:44:27,989 --> 00:44:31,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dewar deployment and then check back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1206
00:44:30,329 --> 00:44:34,019
when we have internet access again so

1207
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:35,788
it's been really great for us but I

1208
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:37,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you need to pick the tool that's</font>

1209
00:44:35,789 --> 00:44:40,710
applicable to your organization for

1210
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:42,089
security needs for auditing needs again

1211
00:44:40,710 --> 00:44:43,650
stress level you know people<font color="#CCCCCC"> out to</font>

1212
00:44:42,089 --> 00:44:45,210
learn<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new tool everyone on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our team</font>

1213
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,299
already knew get so that wasn't a really

1214
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:49,799
big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and of course budget and then</font>

1215
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:51,420
finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know change is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1216
00:44:49,799 --> 00:44:54,839
difficult for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone it particularly</font>

1217
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:57,089
volunteers that again you know may not

1218
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:58,769
necessarily be focused and may<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1219
00:44:57,089 --> 00:45:00,299
distracted for whatever reason because

1220
00:44:58,769 --> 00:45:01,859
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to their camp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1221
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:03,960
build their art piece or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

1222
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:06,058
see their<font color="#CCCCCC"> friends and so for us we</font>

1223
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,099
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on the physical layer and</font>

1224
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:09,479
the personnel<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people layer so we</font>

1225
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:10,769
went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to layer 1 and 8 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we came</font>

1226
00:45:09,479 --> 00:45:13,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the middle and I think that was</font>

1227
00:45:10,769 --> 00:45:15,328
really important because it solved a lot

1228
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,670
of problems where we organically built

1229
00:45:15,329 --> 00:45:20,670
basically these products and services

1230
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,380
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> delivery and processes became</font>

1231
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,390
organic for us it wasn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a process</font>

1232
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:25,739
was forced to us we had to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

1233
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,650
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was really important</font>

1234
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:30,150
particularly around volunteers getting

1235
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:34,619
some fun and excitement out of

1236
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:36,539
continuing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build this network so</font>

1237
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:38,549
finally if there any questions or

1238
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:40,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">comments or anyone has a trenching</font>

1239
00:45:38,549 --> 00:45:43,529
machine they'd like to do some trenching

1240
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:47,210
there's about a 60 mile gap that needs

1241
00:45:43,529 --> 00:45:47,210
some fiber I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly where it is</font>

1242
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:57,180
oh I<font color="#E5E5E5"> see Anton's getting up so I better</font>

1243
00:45:53,670 --> 00:46:00,180
have my qualms skills down racing to the

1244
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,589
mic Anton capella five nines excellent

1245
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,930
presentation that thanks for the summary

1246
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,490
it was a good time reviewing it too I

1247
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,870
did have one question for you that

1248
00:46:05,490 --> 00:46:08,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't see addressed here and that is</font>

1249
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:12,480
I've heard rumors I guess about folks

1250
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,520
bringing gsm-r UMTS hardware or cellular

1251
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,290
infrastructure can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you comment on that</font>

1252
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">or is that something your team does or</font>

1253
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,100
knows about yeah thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony I mean</font>

1254
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:22,410
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great example of a participant</font>

1255
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:25,110
technology project that's a group called

1256
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:29,190
open BTS and so they have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source</font>

1257
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:31,500
gsm framework that ties into asterisks

1258
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:33,480
or other sip servers and they would

1259
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually come to Burning Man for QA so</font>

1260
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,560
what they do is they bring out their

1261
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,600
kind of homegrown gsm stations and they

1262
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:41,759
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bernie man for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DDoS right because</font>

1263
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,160
everyone has you know 70,000 phones try

1264
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:46,620
to associate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and register so they</font>

1265
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,629
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring man for QA they didn't</font>

1266
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,490
return this year but had<font color="#E5E5E5"> been there the</font>

1267
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:52,740
last I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> three years prior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that</font>

1268
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:54,509
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ralph partners with them pretty</font>

1269
00:46:52,740 --> 00:47:00,319
significantly so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he'd bill to</font>

1270
00:46:54,510 --> 00:47:04,920
answer more questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them hi</font>

1271
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:09,120
Brian fields well alcatel-lucent i guess

1272
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:10,680
but just a general question here are

1273
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:13,440
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess first of all are you guys a</font>

1274
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:15,470
nonprofit organization yeah so Bernie

1275

man is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> umbrella organization recently</font>

1276
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:20,700
formed as a non-profit traditionally it

1277
00:47:18,690 --> 00:47:21,750
was an LLC and they're moving all the

1278
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,620
departments under the burning man

1279
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:27,330
project which is a non-profit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool</font>

1280
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,960
this is this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very similar to</font>

1281
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:32,009
some other stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm involved in</font>

1282
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:35,490
and some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the networks that we've</font>

1283

00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:32,480
interesting problem so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ComNet as you do</font>

1306
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:34,100
point out is a cellular provider focused

1307
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:36,080
on rural agreement so they basically put

1308
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:37,790
a cell site in a remote region then they

1309
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,279
have Roman agreements with<font color="#E5E5E5"> t-mobile AT&T</font>

00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:43,100
Verizon that sort of thing the same

00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,050
provider that we buy our IP from is the

00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,940
same place they buy their back home from

1313
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:51,530
