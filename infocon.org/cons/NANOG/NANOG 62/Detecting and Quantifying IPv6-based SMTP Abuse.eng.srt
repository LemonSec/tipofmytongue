00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so first our first talker speaker</font>

2
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:16,180
today this afternoon will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be KC deco</font>

3
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:20,439
from as they pronounce it right DC oh

4
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay from varus on labs talking about</font>

5
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,200
abusive ipv6 smtp

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright thanks so the work that I'm</font>

7
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,000
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking about today is a</font>

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,820
little bit about measurement related to

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,140
ipv6 and specifically<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the abusive</font>

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:51,420
realm of ipv6 and I'll try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivate</font>

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,769
this a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if we give a</font>

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,620
little bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> background in the ipv4</font>

13
00:00:52,769 --> 00:00:57,510
world and think about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,209
problems we<font color="#CCCCCC"> face in terms of abuse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

15
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,849
traffic one of them is spam and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

16
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,670
course there are various classes of spam

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,900
ranging from the spectrum<font color="#E5E5E5"> of annoying</font>

18
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,170
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're your typical</font>

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,390
pharmaceutical type spam to downright

20
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,780
dangerous with malware or something like

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,460
that fishing type attacks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the</font>

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,070
sources of course are diverse you might

23
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,070
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> bots compromised machines that are</font>

24
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,649
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> out there sending the spam</font>

25
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:29,279
directly or you might have you know

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,960
something behind an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP in the ISPs smtp</font>

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,659
relay is actually forwarding it on so

28
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,100
you have different sources where it

29
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,689
might actually appear to be coming from

30
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,320
and so we have this notion of

31
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:46,740
blacklisting in the ipv4 world and a lot

32
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:49,619
of MTA's subscribe to<font color="#CCCCCC"> black lists this</font>

33
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,270
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly commonplace and because of</font>

34
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reputation system a lot of things</font>

35
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,658
are able to be stopped right at the

36
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:59,069
front door rather than incurring

37
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:01,979
additional processing and the additional

38
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:07,289
risk associated with with having to

39
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:12,060
allow things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

40
00:02:07,289 --> 00:02:15,000
about the ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> analogue to this so at</font>

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,830
the moment we currently have relatively

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,290
little data there there may be some data

43
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,830
out there of course but it is less than

44
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:25,440
we have in the ipv4 world certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

45
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,040
at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current methodology of you</font>

46
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,290
know a per IP address type blocking is

47
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,760
infeasible in the ipv6 world and there

48
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:34,459
may be other methodologies but at least

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,609
in

50
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:41,720
using that specific type of blacklisting

51
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,460
just doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in ipv6 so there are</font>

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,530
some questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of deployment</font>

53
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,110
there may be folks out that are there

54
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:51,380
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are concerned with deploying ipv6</font>

55
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:55,360
for example at their<font color="#CCCCCC"> MTA's because of</font>

56
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:58,820
risk of not having this type of

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,560
protection or filtering at your MTA so

58
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,560
the question is is there a user risk

59
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,660
associated with deploying ipv6 capable

60
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">mta's without reputation and then I've</font>

61
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,770
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mentioned these before there's</font>

62
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:11,839
potentially added computation and then

63
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:12,920
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the allowance of adding</font>

64
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,450
malicious content that would have

65
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,780
otherwise been stopped through your

66
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:22,130
typical ipv4<font color="#E5E5E5"> blast blacklisting</font>

67
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,940
techniques so a related question then is

68
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:29,240
how my operators be able to quantify

69
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:33,079
that risk before deploying ipv6 at their

70
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:36,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">MTA's and that is the focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

71
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,750
research there is some previous work in

72
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,820
this area that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll mention here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

73
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:43,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably isn't comprehensive</font>

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:46,340
but here are two notable experiments

75
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,570
that have been done one of them was with

76
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,300
a legitimate domain setup basically with

77
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,910
no valid recipients but it had some

78
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,480
advertising out there in HTML pages and

79
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,910
so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to try and elicit some spam</font>

80
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,019
little spam was found and then there was

81
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:08,420
sun on more production type email

82
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems but they also found and this was</font>

83
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually done evaluating content and</font>

84
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:16,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">also found little spam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

85
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:20,810
go on to the the current work so when

86
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,780
deciding what type of way what type of

87
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,520
considerations<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might need for</font>

88
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:27,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">eliciting spam and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> effective it</font>

89
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,280
might be so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are basically three</font>

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,780
different types that I've email domains

91
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,390
that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> identified</font>

92
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,349
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all is active one that actually</font>

93
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:44,270
has valid email recipients on the other

94
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,580
side<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the other one is illegitimate</font>

95
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:49,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so there are</font>

96
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,740
have have never been legitimate

97
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:53,120
recipient's email recipients on the

98
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,849
other side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then previously active</font>

99
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,770
you maybe you've registered a domain or

100
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:00,650
something that used to be active<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

101
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,870
several considerations along this way so

102
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,429
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of effectiveness there's the</font>

103
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,860
volume of traffic how much traffic

104
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,610
you're going to elicit from would-be

105
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,650
spammers there's the targeted vs random

106
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:18,139
so you know there's actually some value

107
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">in to trying to send spam to a you know</font>

108
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,240
someplace where there are actual users

109
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:24,979
and then there's also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

110
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,680
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may be able to look at content</font>

111
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:29,710
versus<font color="#E5E5E5"> just who the sender is and that</font>

112
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,659
will come into that a little bit later

113
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,099
and then there's issues of security and

114
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:35,780
privacy if you're actually working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

115
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:37,520
active domain for example how do you

116
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,099
consider things like security and

117
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,840
privacy and as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your</font>

118
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:45,949
current system if you're deploying it on

119
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,508
an active<font color="#E5E5E5"> domain and then reliability</font>

120
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't want to take down your</font>

121
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:52,940
production systems by doing some type of

122
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:55,400
experiment<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what we propose is</font>

123
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,180
something called relevant zero risk

124
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:02,539
abusive ipv6 measurement<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so</font>

125
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,969
using a active email domain and I say

126
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:10,460
your domain here meaning this is

127
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:12,560
something you can try at home and so the

128
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea is that we get this kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

129
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,330
value traffic high value to spammers but

130
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,620
not only to spammers or we would hope it

131
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:20,779
would be high value to spammers because

132
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,180
there's you know real users here but

133
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:24,740
also high value to the operators and

134
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,719
users because you're getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that's</font>

135
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,419
associated with your actual domain

136
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,069
rather than some you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> fictitious</font>

137
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:32,180
honeypot domain that's that's out there

138
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,539
that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any legitimate</font>

139
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,539
accounts

140
00:06:35,259 --> 00:06:42,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so basically the idea behind this</font>

141
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,830
is the following in setting this up so

142
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,720
you have kind of two notions of pre

143
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,198
configuration and the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that your</font>

144
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:54,620
production<font color="#CCCCCC"> MTA's would have would be</font>

145
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,780
ipv4 only at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point and only have a</font>

146
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,560
records okay and this is we we expect

147
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,508
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font>

148
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,449
environment that you would be in any way

149
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:04,370
if you're kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of if you haven't</font>

150
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">deployed ipv6 yet and this is where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

151
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:09,139
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I pee before only have</font>

152
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,229
only a records and then you're using

153
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:15,440
some type of reputation system to reject

154
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:17,389
ipv4 spam attempts okay then the changes

155
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,750
you would make would be that you would

156
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:22,699
if you're not already logged these

157
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,190
rejections at your production mtas as

158
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:27,530
they're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and then there would</font>

159
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:32,169
be this sensor MTA deployed with both

160
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:34,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">ipv4 and ipv6 connectivity as well as</font>

161
00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:38,840
corresponding a and quad a records for

162
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,819
this host<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and then at the sensor</font>

163
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,710
MTA you would also<font color="#E5E5E5"> be rejecting any</font>

164
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:48,169
incoming connections port 25 connections

165
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:50,210
over your at<font color="#CCCCCC"> your sensor MTA and then</font>

166
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,630
finally once all that is set up then you

167
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,580
would add a<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher order MX pointing to</font>

168
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,409
the sensor MTA now you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

169
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,479
questions as to why it's done like this

170
00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:00,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">let me show you a quick kind of</font>

171
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,300
architectural slide to show how this

172
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,669
would work and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll explain some of</font>

173
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,400
the reasoning behind this so in the red

174
00:08:04,669 --> 00:08:08,630
if this is a this might be somewhat

175
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,810
small print but in the red that

176
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:15,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically represents ipv4 transport in</font>

177
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:19,130
the blue represents ipv4 or ipv6

178
00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:24,469
transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual stack connectivity and so</font>

179
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:27,889
a typical what we would hope at least

180
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:30,169
for a blacklisted client out there was

181
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:33,529
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they would initially attempt to</font>

182
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:36,740
connect to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> primary MX than to the N</font>

183
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:38,719
be rejected over smtp same thing for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

184
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,870
secondary MX you know and then so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

185
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,219
until they get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your sensor MTA at</font>

186
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:48,790
which point they would be rejected with

187
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:48,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp reset on both ipv4 and ipv6</font>

188
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:57,350
now a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple so let's see a couple of</font>

189
00:08:54,649 --> 00:08:59,110
reasoning a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the items of</font>

190
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:02,920
reasoning behind this so first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all</font>

191
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:06,350
this in this way there's you're not

192
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,810
allowing any additional spam from<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

193
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">initial delivery attempts from known</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

194
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:14,149
pee before spammer stuff that wouldn't

195
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:16,850
have would already have been rejected is

196
00:09:14,149 --> 00:09:19,149
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be allowed in okay so</font>

197
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,480
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first reasoning behind this</font>

198
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:25,700
and that's over ipv4 or ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

199
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,980
rejection log at the production MTA now

200
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,270
allows spammers to be identified when

201
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,250
they are making<font color="#E5E5E5"> their connection</font>

202
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,199
attempts to the sensor<font color="#CCCCCC"> mt because you've</font>

203
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:36,410
logged those you can now kind of filter

204
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,200
out your your your true positives

205
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,899
attempts from those spammers okay and

206
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">also because we're sending resets on the</font>

207
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:46,430
sensor MTA there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be no</font>

208
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,959
legitimate mail accidentally delivered

209
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:50,540
to the sensor so you don't get in the

210
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,489
case of oh I lost my mail why was that

211
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:56,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh because we lost primary connectivity</font>

212
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:57,589
at the at the primary mtas and so we

213
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,089
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have that kind of</font>

214
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:02,959
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone would</font>

215
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:04,910
like that and then of course because you

216
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,010
have dual stack connectivity you can

217
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,860
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sender's have the opportunity</font>

218
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,620
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send to both ipv4 and ipv6 and detect</font>

219
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,910
that connectivity at the sensor MTA and

220
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,130
then of course for legitimate centers

221
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,839
who are not blacklisted they are going

222
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:19,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try the primary MTA first they won't</font>

223
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">even know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that something is different</font>

224
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,010
about your architecture and in the worst

225
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,380
case where there is some type of problem

226
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:28,760
connectivity issue then they'll just get

227
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,620
rejected the other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have</font>

228
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,750
this this delivery time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's</font>

229
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,940
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the concepts behind this and why</font>

230
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:37,850
it was done this way in kind of a what

231
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:39,980
we would call a<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero ask approach okay</font>

232
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:42,640
so the next step is now we've got this

233
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:46,160
architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up so how do i identify</font>

234
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:49,300
spammers well the ipv4 spawns ipv4

235
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,000
spammers are known because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have the</font>

236
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,949
dns block list and the rejection log at

237
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,350
the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> MTA so the challenge then of</font>

238
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:59,089
course is identifying the ipv6 spammers

239
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:01,760
so we have to do some type of

240
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:06,260
association between other

241
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">is apparent disparate connection</font>

242
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:11,060
attempts at the sensor MTA so somehow we

243
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:14,330
have to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to associate these and</font>

244
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,180
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically take two steps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to in</font>

245
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:19,960
preliminary analysis to look at how

246
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,430
these might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> associated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and kind of a</font>

247
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:25,940
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least initially a kind of a naive</font>

248
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,670
fashion but there are two steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 1st</font>

249
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,980
the first one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to actually identify</font>

250
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated sins from the same connect</font>

251
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:36,710
attempt connect referring to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

252
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,839
socket API and then and then associate

253
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">different connect attempts from the same</font>

254
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:45,980
host meaning the ipv4 and the

255
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:48,620
corresponding ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so a couple</font>

256
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,450
caveats that you may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already caught</font>

257
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,280
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will bring to your attention if you</font>

258
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:54,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't but first of all there is no</font>

259
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,079
message content here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and that was</font>

260
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,660
deliberate but the spammers identified

261
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,880
only by association so spammers are

262
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:05,630
identified but not necessarily spam and

263
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,100
that is by design at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

264
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,770
also note that spammers are not

265
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,250
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to follow</font>

266
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:15,020
specification and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we also</font>

267
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,990
believe that you know if they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

268
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:19,970
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> value from trying whatever MX's</font>

269
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,040
over whatever protocols then then they

270
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:23,960
will and we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some data to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show</font>

271
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,099
some of this but we but we do recognize

272
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,590
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not necessarily going to</font>

273
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:30,310
spot follow us back and to be honest not

274
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:32,900
all implementations do either<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

275
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:34,550
spammers don't necessarily try ipv4 and

276
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:39,290
ipv6 also in or do they necessarily

277
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:42,229
trolley try the ordering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the final</font>

278
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,270
thing here is that ground truth is

279
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,640
nearly impossible to obtain without

280
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,490
having observation right at the

281
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,500
ascending client<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's what</font>

282
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,650
makes this somewhat tricky we're only

283
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at the server side of things</font>

284
00:12:53,650 --> 00:13:03,220
okay so first of all looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at sin</font>

285
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:06,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">association</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we have basically</font>

286
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:10,880
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this sliding window to</font>

287
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:12,800
look at the time between sins that have

288
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,650
the same source port and source IP

289
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,420
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and and we use twenty five</font>

290
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,430
second that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually just based on</font>

291
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,680
initial observations and that might have

292
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:27,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">been because even though we're sending</font>

293
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,910
back a TCP reset sometimes they<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

294
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:33,620
clients were maybe not getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

295
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:35,510
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of a back off that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was kind</font>

296
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,520
of our guests as to what we were seeing

297
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:39,140
there because usually you see kind of a

298
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:47,750
rapid failure and then you see a rapid

299
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:49,160
retry but let's see and then so this is

300
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:52,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way that we were then looking at</font>

301
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,780
once we had the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kinect attempts in terms</font>

302
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:59,590
of grouping the sins together identified

303
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:03,260
then we use several ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify</font>

304
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,630
different associated connect attempts

305
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,360
and so the first one which I call

306
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,130
apparently embedded ipv4 host<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay some</font>

307
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,050
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are if you have like a six to</font>

308
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:14,780
four address for example that's the the

309
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:16,520
most common of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we would see</font>

310
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,290
where you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2002 and then you have</font>

311
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,510
your address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then or the gateway</font>

312
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:23,569
address and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a bunch of</font>

313
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:26,930
zeros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then your host address at the</font>

314
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:28,340
end<font color="#E5E5E5"> and last 32 bits okay so that was</font>

315
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,599
the most recognizable we actually found

316
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,140
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of other places we're</font>

317
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:37,250
doing that as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used that</font>

318
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:39,680
methodology to to to associate ipv4 and

319
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:42,200
ipv6 also looking at the DNS pointer

320
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,839
record to see if they match using the 64

321
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,440
gateway as opposed to the host we used

322
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">poff to do TCP fingerprinting of the</font>

323
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:53,810
sins that were being sent in<font color="#E5E5E5"> k 2 and</font>

324
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">four OS and that helped gain additional</font>

325
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,260
insights into what types of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts we</font>

326
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,100
were seeing and then we are also using

327
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:04,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">asn okay which of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asns don't have</font>

328
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,480
to be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same between ipv4 and ipv6 but</font>

329
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,730
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize in a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways that they</font>

330
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:11,000
are for whatever reasons administrative

331
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:14,150
or logistic and so we were using that

332
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,620
okay let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me summarize this slide because</font>

333
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:18,319
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information on here but</font>

334
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is address preference</font>

335
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,340
according to RFC 67 24 for our purposes

336
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:31,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">means that ipv6 is selected first for</font>

337
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:34,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">for get a tour info and ipv4 is fallback</font>

338
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:39,320
except in the case of 6 24 in which case

339
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:41,930
the ipv4 is selected first and ipv6 is

340
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:43,250
back up in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of preference ordering</font>

341
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,560
and we saw at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the most current</font>

342
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of these os's the get a tour</font>

343
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,969
info call actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed these not</font>

344
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,770
that spammers are necessarily using that

345
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,690
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using their own API as</font>

346
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,420
well as other<font color="#CCCCCC"> MTA's might be using their</font>

347
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,400
own API for things but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what it's</font>

348
00:15:56,420 --> 00:16:00,860
worth that's what we found and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

349
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,480
was also the basis for our ordering when

350
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,820
we looked when we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to group</font>

351
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,310
these connect attempts was to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

352
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:11,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> order was the v6 before the v4</font>

353
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:12,589
except in the case of 624<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and we</font>

354
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,260
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this on a production email</font>

355
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,970
domain with around 10,000 users we

356
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,550
captured<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic between january</font>

357
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:22,700
november two thousand thirteen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

358
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:25,849
we as i just mentioned did things of v6

359
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,710
first except in the case of 6 24 and and

360
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:33,350
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> use OS identification with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> poth</font>

361
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:36,290
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide shows a graph of some</font>

362
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:39,470
of the traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw and so these</font>

363
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,480
are this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a daily connect attempts now</font>

364
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,290
one other caveat here is because these

365
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,060
are connection attempts<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

366
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:50,959
unable<font color="#CCCCCC"> to determine whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not this</font>

367
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:55,550
is a somebody that an MTA for example a

368
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,830
is pmta that's out there retrying a to

369
00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,170
deliver the same message over and over

370
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">or if these are new messages from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BOTS</font>

371
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:06,290
or whatever but this does give us some

372
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,579
idea of activity that's out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok now</font>

373
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">I have these grouped into three</font>

374
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,740
categories in the blue the middle line

375
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:16,339
there is ipv6 attempts that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were able</font>

376
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:19,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">to associate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with ipv4 addresses</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

377
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:22,399
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we have in the the lowest one</font>

378
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:23,240
there is ipv6 unassociated and that's

379
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,069
because

380
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,349
we were not able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to associate with</font>

381
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:29,420
anything for better or for worse you

382
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">know spammer or not and so we had to put</font>

383
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">in its own category and then we have</font>

384
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,150
ipv4 attempts at the top but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

385
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you see here is we had summer on</font>

386
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:41,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> order of you know ten or a hundred</font>

387
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:43,700
thousand connect attempts excuse me on

388
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,500
the order of thousands connect attempts

389
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,840
per day and then we had two orders of

390
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,920
magnitude<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher of a v4 attempt so</font>

391
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,990
about a hundred times more v four

392
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:58,550
attempts than<font color="#E5E5E5"> than v six attempts at the</font>

393
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,840
sensor MTA<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so anyway what we</font>

394
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:02,870
see from that last slide though by the

395
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">way is simply that the traffic is not</font>

396
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:06,889
negligible there certainly is something

397
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:10,040
there it's dwarfed of course by the be

398
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:12,020
four we wanted to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a break down and</font>

399
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:16,129
look at some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the hosts we were seeing</font>

400
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:17,780
the os's and the addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> too part of</font>

401
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,240
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind this was to look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

402
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,550
will these look like you know legitimate

403
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">MTA's that just happen to have a bad bad</font>

404
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,090
rap for whatever reason because they

405
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,699
allowed some spam out or if these are

406
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,889
like compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> machines on an end and</font>

407
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,870
user machine or something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like that ok</font>

408
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,960
but here's here's a breakdown in terms

409
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:38,570
of ipv4 hosts that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw so we saw on</font>

410
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,280
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> left-hand side here you know</font>

411
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:42,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">seventy-two percent of them were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> linux</font>

412
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,629
machines but we saw about eleven eleven

413
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,210
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows machines that were in</font>

414
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:49,550
terms of those that were unassociated<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

415
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">sees me associated hosts and then some</font>

416
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:57,409
percentage of other that we're hitting

417
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:59,209
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay interestingly so when we</font>

418
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:02,720
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at breakdown of address types and</font>

419
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:04,429
again the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> here was to look at if we</font>

420
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,520
could identify which hosts of these were

421
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:10,820
word seemed to be dynamically addressed

422
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,679
in some way or other and so what we were

423
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:14,570
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see most of these six to four</font>

424
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:16,610
dresses that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see about seven seven</font>

425
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,409
point five percent you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know close to</font>

426
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,000
close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ten percent if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you include the</font>

427
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:24,470
unassociated addresses that were showing

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">up at the sensor MTA were 624 and just</font>

429
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:27,860
about all of those were<font color="#E5E5E5"> 624 self</font>

430
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,959
addressed as opposed to being behind

431
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:34,289
some other<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts as a gateway</font>

432
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,760
and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have ground</font>

433
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:38,190
truth here but we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

434
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this might be something a little</font>

435
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,740
bit suspect as this this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a you</font>

436
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,750
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new Windows machine that was</font>

437
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,679
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's bringing up at six to four</font>

438
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:50,429
interface because I had no native v6 and

439
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:53,190
but that's the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing we're</font>

440
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:54,840
looking for is to try and identify these

441
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:57,690
these types of hosts<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can</font>

442
00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:00,360
see we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found some percentage of eui-64</font>

443
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,909
addressing but we also found along the

444
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,110
way that those are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always some</font>

445
00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:06,480
people actually deliberately do that

446
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:11,549
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a you know quote legitimate MTA</font>

447
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:15,570
they're using eui-64 addressing so okay

448
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:17,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">so a couple items we also found along</font>

449
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:21,450
the way so windows XP and<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven actually</font>

450
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:28,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">send three sins in response to a reject</font>

451
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:29,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and it will show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you where this</font>

452
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,168
comes in handy and just second here as

453
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:34,110
opposed to yellow buses which just send

454
00:20:31,169 --> 00:20:37,169
a single sin okay and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what that shows us</font>

455
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:40,379
is so about 75% when we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

456
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:42,600
incoming connect attempts here in the

457
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:45,240
red you see windows which has kind of

458
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:47,520
the large jump there which shows that

459
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 75% of the attempts from Windows</font>

460
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,029
consisted of three sins which is what we

461
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,370
expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's this other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty</font>

462
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:54,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">five percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down at the bottom that</font>

463
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:57,989
actually don't have that type of

464
00:20:54,899 --> 00:21:02,489
behavior and if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the next slide</font>

465
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:05,789
here what we did was<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> took the we had</font>

466
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:08,070
this kind of hypothesis that with with

467
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:09,779
some port-based gnats that we would

468
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:11,129
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seeing behavior where the</font>

469
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,980
three sins that were sent out by a

470
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:16,110
Windows machine actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

471
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:19,380
seemingly random source ports because of

472
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:20,668
the because of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NAT and that wasn't</font>

473
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,220
that doesn't seem to be the case with

474
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,190
all naats but but we did see some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

475
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,320
that and so we wanted to group these

476
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:30,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">without regard to source port to see</font>

477
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,840
what what things look like and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did</font>

478
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:35,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we actually showed</font>

479
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,209
a lot a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the windows machines</font>

480
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:40,850
that turned up you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about half of</font>

481
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:44,150
the ones that we tested i think turned

482
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:45,740
out to be have this type of behavior of

483
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:47,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the twenty percent that only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

484
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,700
seemingly one source port if that makes

485
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,620
sense so in other words this brings us

486
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,370
back to this is interesting but we were

487
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify potentially I mean what</font>

488
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,600
might be machines that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind nat</font>

489
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,668
that are hitting these which might be

490
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">more indicative of machines that have</font>

491
00:22:01,669 --> 00:22:06,080
been compromised or user type machines

492
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:10,039
as opposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these this other category</font>

493
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,830
of MTA's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay one other item we found</font>

494
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:14,570
along the way was that with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

495
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,570
machines when they do a femoral source

496
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,220
port allocation they're actually

497
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:23,450
allocating source ports from the same

498
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:26,390
pool for ipv6 or ipv4 whereas<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux is</font>

499
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:28,130
allocating and and Mac os10 actually

500
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:31,700
they actually allocate from different

501
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:34,850
pools and that was helpful in helping us

502
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,750
kind of validate some of the findings we

503
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:39,320
were looking when we did our

504
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:42,580
associations so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I show this graph</font>

505
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:46,010
right here<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is a graph and</font>

506
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:47,539
apologize here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be a little bit</font>

507
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,399
hard to follow but in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very</font>

508
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">middle line that goes up so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

509
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,580
distribution here and the middle line

510
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:56,510
that goes up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very middle</font>

511
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:59,570
represents a jump for Windows machines

512
00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,970
in difference between the associated the

513
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:05,149
source port of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the associated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 and the</font>

514
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:08,210
social source port of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the associated v6</font>

515
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:09,979
and ninety-seven percent of those had a

516
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,090
difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between one and five hundred</font>

517
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,020
which closely core correlates to the

518
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,490
behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would expect from a</font>

519
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,620
Windows machine so it actually very high

520
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:20,000
correlation with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this which shows that</font>

521
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,750
our association at least for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Windows</font>

522
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,909
host was quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> good we also have this in</font>

523
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,490
the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the blue line also</font>

524
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:32,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">follows this little jump in the middle</font>

525
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:35,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and we were trying to to look at</font>

526
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,460
those it turns out that

527
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,540
that about fifteen percent so that was

528
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">about fifteen percent of the other</font>

529
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,740
attempts all but<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those are</font>

530
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:43,909
unidentified with by pop and so we

531
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,320
believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually with the address</font>

532
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">association that we were doing we were</font>

533
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,370
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of go above and beyond what</font>

534
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,129
the typical sin might might lead you to

535
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:53,780
find and identify those as Windows host

536
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,250
as well those were inferred Windows host

537
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,870
because the high correlation you have a

538
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,620
fairly good confidence that those were

539
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:02,439
those were<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a couple minor</font>

540
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:06,760
notes that we found along the way as

541
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:10,610
kind of anecdotes so at one point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our</font>

542
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:13,010
experimentation we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> MTA's from to</font>

543
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">microsoft SNS that had they gave us</font>

544
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:18,580
roughly<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 million connect attempts over</font>

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:20,720
a period of<font color="#E5E5E5"> about one month so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

546
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,370
corresponds<font color="#E5E5E5"> to about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know one</font>

connect every five seconds from each of

548
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:28,010
these / 64 networks and there were few

549
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,690
corresponding v4 attempts during that

550
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,970
time and so we weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly sure we</font>

551
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:32,810
actually were trying to investigate this

552
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,580
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it was certainly</font>

553
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:35,629
anomalous and something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font>

554
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">was interesting to bring up to this</font>

555
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">group but apparently not associated with</font>

556
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,510
real temp so whether this buggy behavior

557
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,450
or what it lasted for about a month and

558
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:45,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">then it kind of went away but</font>

559
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,370
interesting and we had something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar</font>

560
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,170
with send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mail actually we had a large</font>

number of incoming requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

562
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,490
associated with v4 that we could see

563
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,169
this was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually an instance of send</font>

564

mail that we were unable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reproduce in</font>

565
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:03,260
our lab environment as we were trying

but in contacting the vendor<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the</font>

567
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:09,260
owner of the MTA we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font>

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is what it was so but what</font>

569
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:14,540
they did was distribute these connect

00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:15,950
attempts attempt delivery attempts from

571
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:17,270
the same address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and source port in</font>

572
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:19,340
succession over several weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

573
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,540
weren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if this was simply reusing</font>

574
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:23,990
the same port because it was associated

575
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the the message or where if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

576
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,680
was associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the same connect</font>

577
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,840
attempt and somehow got hung up but very

578
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting behavior we were unsure what</font>

579
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,419
it caused it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but to kind of wrap up</font>

580
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:37,340
here so reputation of ipv6 internet is

581
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:39,950
still largely unknown we've presented

582
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:42,139
some a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experimental architecture</font>

583
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,360
here the idea behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that you could</font>

584
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:47,389
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run this on your own network</font>

585
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,099
and get some type of feedback as to

586
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:50,958
what things look like if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> were to</font>

587
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:53,989
turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and what type of activity</font>

588
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:55,429
might see not<font color="#E5E5E5"> having the v6 reputation</font>

589
00:25:53,989 --> 00:25:57,079
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently with v4 and</font>

590
00:25:55,429 --> 00:26:00,499
there is some moderate presence of

591
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,959
spammers though the spam content itself

592
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:04,669
can't be confirmed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

593
00:26:02,959 --> 00:26:06,589
further work to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at what the</font>

594
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:08,809
actual sources are and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> things look</font>

595
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:09,950
like in terms of actual distribution in

596
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:11,329
other words trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get closer to</font>

597
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,499
ground truth than what we currently have

598
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:17,809
now and I should<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention that we are</font>

599
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:19,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in and I think it would be</font>

600
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">very interesting to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build a network of</font>

601
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:22,908
this and any of your if any of you have

602
00:26:20,989 --> 00:26:25,339
interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this and kind of doing a</font>

603
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:26,989
research collaboration and contributing

604
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:30,708
to this then I'd be glad to hear about

605
00:26:26,989 --> 00:26:33,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">it that's all I have except for</font>

606
00:26:30,709 --> 00:26:33,159
questions

607
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:42,389
we have time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions</font>

608
00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:45,030
Jeff Houston the ground beef sex

609
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:48,000
experiment or<font color="#CCCCCC"> himself Jeff Jeff Houston</font>

610
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,760
I panic I was kind of wondering if you

611
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,870
could identify with in your process to

612
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:57,360
what extent the MTA software is simply

613
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,159
following the MX and using the

614
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,590
underlying capabilities of the platform

615
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,900
to do four and six so it's not a

616
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,899
deliberate attempt to actually hide

617
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,110
behind sex but it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just doing</font>

618
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:12,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">the MX think protocols or protocols</font>

619
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:16,020
versus this idea that most DNS block

620
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:18,510
lists are just v4 lists and the spammers

621
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,389
interests are well served by

622
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:23,760
deliberately pushing themselves into the

623
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:26,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">six protocol did you see any evidence of</font>

624
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">that degree of sophistication in</font>

625
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,200
thinking or the spammers still just

626
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">using rocks and hammers yeah that's a</font>

627
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">great question Jeff and in fact so there</font>

628
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:36,929
were a couple avenues along this line

629
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,178
that we were looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at and some of our</font>

630
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:41,669
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> so far less than conclusive I</font>

631
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:44,640
mean it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to find out what's</font>

632
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:46,470
conclusive at this point but as you can

633
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,850
imagine but a few of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that</font>

634
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've also looked at along those lines</font>

635
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:53,549
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay look further into these these</font>

636
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:55,379
unassociated v6 addresses I mean is it

637
00:27:53,549 --> 00:27:56,908
because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just not associated</font>

638
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:59,460
incorrectly or is this somebody trying

639
00:27:56,909 --> 00:28:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">to circumvent just as you had said and</font>

640
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:03,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">and in fact you know we'd had actually</font>

641
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,669
you and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

642
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,919
conversation about this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

643
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:10,440
does it look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like from inside a provider</font>

644
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:15,260
network standpoint you know are the v6

645
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:18,809
and including protocol 41 blocks just as

646
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:21,570
you know blocked just as well blocked as

647
00:28:18,809 --> 00:28:23,940
the v4 equivalent for outgoing smtp for

648
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:25,799
example and the other part<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

649
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:28,289
started to look at is looking at things

650
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:31,799
like address agility because they're so

651
00:28:28,289 --> 00:28:34,650
you know there's this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of long you</font>

652
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:37,320
know sparse address range and vast and

653
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:38,850
and so can can somebody go in and say

654
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one and</font>

655
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,520
doesn't work well let me try<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font>

656
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,830
and you know and keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying we saw</font>

657
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,210
actually very little example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that so</font>

658
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,520
far that you changing your address

659
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:48,460
within your same / 64 or something like

660
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,440
that

661
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:52,240
the other one we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to investigate</font>

662
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:55,830
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> further but high interest</font>

663
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,830
in doing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you</font>

664
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:05,610
okay no other questions thanks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

665
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,610
thank you

666
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,800
you
