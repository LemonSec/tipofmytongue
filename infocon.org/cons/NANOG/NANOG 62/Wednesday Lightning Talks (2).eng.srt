<font color="#E5E5E5">understanding of what remote trigger</font>

00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:23,310
black hole is so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer</font>

24
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:25,860
typically with a peer relationship with

an upstream<font color="#E5E5E5"> isp they signal the upstream</font>

particular address or prefix and so that

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,590
traffic stops before it gets on to the

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,970
link of the customer and so that works

30
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">great and that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice and that's been</font>

35
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,509
cuss and the customers upstream ISP or

36
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:57,810
some peer of some sort and so there's a

37
00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:00,119
particular problem here or a potential

38
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem in certain cases so while this</font>

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,970
much good so this this leads us to a

45
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:19,530
conclusion that what we're missing is

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,200
something else that's that's bigger than

47
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,060
this i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more coordinated would</font>

48
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,440
be nice if it was automated and

49
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:31,770
something very quick to to deploy across

50
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,840
a wider range of autonomous systems so

51
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,700
too when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traditional approaches of a</font>

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,959
denial service tech if you have

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot deal with</font>

54
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,959
yourself there's phone calls that are

55
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,330
involved mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists post to get other</font>

56
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,860
people involved to help out so that

57
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,840
takes a significant amount of time so

58
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,269
what can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">better or perhaps we extend the idea of</font>

60
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,630
remote trigger black hole to the

61
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,420
community so we have a remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> trigger</font>

62
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,790
black hole server that many

63
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,708
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> pr2 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't necessarily</font>

64
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,540
a new idea but it's a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've</font>

65
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,830
we've somewhat attempted before and

66
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,079
other people have tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a similar</font>

67
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of thing but people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have asked us</font>

68
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,920
about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> again recently and so we said</font>

69
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we'll give it a try we'll see if we</font>

70
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,329
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to do this so we have this</font>

71
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,600
basically remote trigger black hole

72
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,370
server that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can peer with and it's</font>

73
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,310
just getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> started so we have maybe 15</font>

74
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,100
or 20 peers today and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

75
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:25,019
someone injects a prefix into this and

76
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:27,299
it gets distributed to all the others

77
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,430
participants who then block the traffic

78
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,620
closer to that their edge at least of

79
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,250
the network and so if there is enough

80
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,810
networks participating in this in theory

81
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:43,350
you can you can block a significant

82
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,519
attack on a very distributed basis so

83
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:45,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read all the bullet</font>

84
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:47,700
points<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but I'll cover a few things</font>

85
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:50,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can find this slide deck on Nana's</font>

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,018
web page you can search for me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> team</font>

87
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:54,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">cumbrian you'll find a more detailed faq</font>

88
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,450
about all those sorts of stuff but today

89
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,060
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing ipv4 / 32 s route</font>

90
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:01,530
announcements we can do floats back

91
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:03,000
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have asked us about the wouldn't</font>

92
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,970
it be nice if we could do flow spectacle

93
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,489
he said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in fact we could do it we</font>

94
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:11,010
use software called<font color="#CCCCCC"> exa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp which</font>

95
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:13,440
supports flow spec we've actually tried

96
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,090
flows<font color="#E5E5E5"> Becky for and we literally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got no</font>

97
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,478
interest in people actually setting up

98
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,340
hearing sessions with close by so we're

99
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">not we're not actually doing flow spec</font>

100
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,580
today but if enough people say please

101
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:27,240
please enable flow spec for these kinds

102
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,940
of routes then we'll turn on here's what

103
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,990
it looks like on<font color="#E5E5E5"> our site appearing</font>

104
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:33,080
configure looks like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper config</font>

105
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,700
there's nothing really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy about this</font>

106
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,370
you the one thing I'll point out towards

107
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end there's a block for static</font>

108
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,180
routes this is where the announcements

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,130
would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd be a bunch of / 32 s in</font>

110
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,500
there potentially it's currently empty

111
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,850
it will hopefully usually be empty so

112
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that traditionally though or on a</font>

113
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,120
regular basis there won't be that many

114
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:59,010
attacks going on so that would normally

115
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a very limited list if not empty so</font>

116
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:04,650
this allows us to scale to which is

117
00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:06,000
potentially nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a one of the couple</font>

118
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,840
things i'll mention about the properties

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,730
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won't</font>

120
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,849
bullet point here but we are requiring

121
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:15,690
tctmd five for sessions since this is

122
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-hop sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Patrick but we will be</font>

123
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:24,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">requiring that the the config on our</font>

124
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,520
site is essentially flexible really

125
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,290
flexible except for our peering address

126
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,639
we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use any old peering</font>

127
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,830
address but otherwise we can configure

128
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">this session as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want our asn we can</font>

129
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,219
change your SN we could do essentially

130
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,669
whatever you want although we'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

131
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,080
use your<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're assigned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a SN but we can</font>

132
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,669
set community tags and all that sort of

133
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,570
stuff it's very easy for us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

134
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:48,450
that so we only announced / 30 tues ipv4

135
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,800
we're not doing v6 right now we could

136
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:52,139
there's nothing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevent us from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

137
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,360
that but that hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been asked of us to</font>

138
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:58,020
do yet so until the time comes we're

139
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:01,260
just doing that it's currently a manual

140
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:03,030
process and this is the piece that may

141
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:06,930
change depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reaction to this</font>

142
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:09,330

somewhat successful and if we get to the

144
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,469
point of hundred people expressing

145
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,210
interest or peering with us this project

146
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,120
within 30 days we will say will claim

147
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,460
this as a success we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop</font>

148
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">or extend the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Softworks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exa bgp to do</font>

149
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,169
some automated things when we have

150
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">received an announcement then we can</font>

151
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:29,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually pass it on so it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

152
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,620
out-of-band manual vetting process for

153
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:32,970
that route so right now it's if there's

154
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,580
an attack someone has to manually

155
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:38,970
contact us<font color="#CCCCCC"> the email or phone call and</font>

156
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,969
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply the route the only person</font>

157
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:45,570
who can apply or submit a prefix is the

158
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,220
originator of a block covering that / /

159
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,840
32 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a decision to say</font>

160
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,760
look I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like Google today</font>

161
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just decide Google DNS is</font>

162
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,620
no good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and block 88 so I stir t2 that's</font>

163
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,030
that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the systems designed</font>

164
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,150
it's the only people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are allowed to</font>

165
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,950
inject routes to this or effectively the

166
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,330
victims and those who have a

167
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,880
relationship with us and we've added

168
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:10,250
them and they then tell us that they

169
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,250
have a prefix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to announce</font>

170
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,380
when we get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the automated process the</font>

171
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,419
current thinking is that and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

172
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,490
open to discussion or if you have ideas

173
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:24,240
as well simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

174
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:27,569
his the historicity of the the route

175
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,580
prefix itself for the the route<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

176
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:31,440
you're announcing and if we see that

177
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been originating this route for</font>

178
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,030
some period of time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this code hasn't</font>

179
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:37,050
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> written yet but say 30 days and</font>

180
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,609
you're the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one who's been</font>

181
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:41,250
originating this prefix well okay maybe

182
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,419
that's good enough and then we'll accept

183
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,650
that route if there's something that

184
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:45,960
looks a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> odd like if there's</font>

185
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,500
multiple origins maybe will flag it and

186
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,120
then it gets punted to a manual<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

187
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,669
so that's our current thing of how we

188
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,659
would do it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't think</font>

189
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:56,580
we want to go down the route of like

190
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:58,800
route servers and you know if there was

191
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,139
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki you know that might work of</font>

192
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,150
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then it might not because</font>

193
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:05,250
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the originator of this route</font>

194
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,789
so although if we pass it on with the

195
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,349
original guess maybe that'll work so it

196
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:11,400
remains to be seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how this will</font>

197
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:13,800
be implemented but I think it will

198
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,539
probably be based off but route history

199
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,800
if you have anything specific to say

200
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:19,740
about how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should work I'd certainly</font>

201
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,380
like to hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it it'll also go out</font>

202
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,729
via out of an alerts and so forth we've

203
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,039
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about maybe delaying the</font>

204
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,570
announcements or providing the ability

205
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:29,009
for someone to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a delayed</font>

206
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,560
announcement so they're not necessary

207
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:33,599
the first to get it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

208
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,849
very cautious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about getting routes first</font>

209
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,050
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't let it be the cut between a</font>

210
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,620
rock and a hard place if<font color="#CCCCCC"> something gets</font>

211
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:43,559
messed up this all of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

212
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,940
recognize this the RT<font color="#E5E5E5"> Road sugar black</font>

213
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,649
hole finished as an attack I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

214
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,120
all understand that there's not much we

215
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:51,270
can do about that that is the intent

216
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,890
it's a sacrificial lamb if we don't like

217
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:57,770
this then something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow spec maybe</font>

218
00:08:52,890 --> 00:09:01,020
the approach that we ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take so we</font>

219
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:05,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so we have about 15-20 people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

220
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:07,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">it now you can only we're only allowing</font>

221
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:09,300
people to participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this project if</font>

222
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't assigned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ASM so some people</font>

223
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,839
have come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us with a block of</font>

224
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,820
addresses that have maybe been swiped to

225
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,990
them or they've been allocated and if

226
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,420
they are not participating in routing

227
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,640
we're just saying well but we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

228
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,349
you at this time you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we could</font>

229
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,250
do something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> future but only</font>

230
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:28,529
taking bgp speakers is effectively if we

231
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't get a hundred peers within about</font>

232
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:32,400
30 or 60 days we're just going to cancel

233
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:33,990
this project so i would like to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

234
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,699
even if you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you</font>

235
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,440
would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this but if you have</font>

236
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,470
any interest in this could work you say

237
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,839
maybe I'll run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a test lab do tell me and</font>

238
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,270
that will at least keep us working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

239
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you don't tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that too</font>

240
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,149
and tell me this is a stupid idea and

241
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,939
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is ridiculous and I would never do</font>

242
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:52,890
this I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> take it send me that I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

243
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know that also I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to waste</font>

244
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:59,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">my time on if no one's going to do it so</font>

245
00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:00,839
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I disclosed who's using it today</font>

246
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,580
if you were participating you would get

247
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,350
to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but as a smattering of</font>

248
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,610
people that some small networks some

249
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,440
small hosting providers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some</font>

250
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,140
educational institutions and there's a

251
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,810
couple of simply large eyes peas<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

252
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:14,160
participating in this as well and

253
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:17,279
there's a couple who are interested in

254
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,020
very cautious understandably and

255
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,380
probably waiting to see what other

256
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,699
people do so I there will be certain

257
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,410
people who just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and</font>

258
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,080
we're okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't expect all</font>

259
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,779
AS IS to participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but we'll</font>

260
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,709
see if we can get a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them to do it</font>

261
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:33,180
so there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few things left to do</font>

262
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:36,180
there's some code to potentially right

263
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,859
if we continue this project the most

264
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,020
important thing for me is to take myself

265
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,790
out of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture because if you send</font>

266
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,680
an email to our web form to sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

267
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,990
the some processing all that stuff if

268
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,029
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a route inject into this</font>

269
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">it will be me taking care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and I</font>

270
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:51,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to come out of that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture we have</font>

271
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:54,029
a 24 by 7 knock and so they should be

272
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:55,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing that not me there's been some</font>

273
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:57,810
other ideas we have a internet exchange

274
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,060
protection service and our bogan feed

275
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,310
and should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put those routes in this</font>

276
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,199
so you can also run those routes along

277
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,849
with the service and we said okay well

278
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,089
maybe you could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well but all</font>

279
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,010
these things are on on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the drawing board</font>

280
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:13,529
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll let you look at this page and</font>

281
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:15,630

brief this is a introduction<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a topic</font>

friday and more length so think of this

300
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:10,360
as the teaser I just want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks to</font>

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going on you might be</font>

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,850
interested you might not be interested

303
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:18,010
frankly but it's definitely a pretty

304
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:21,700
significant change that's an importance

305
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:24,689
of the community it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ayana so</font>

306
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:27,040
what we're facing now is we're facing

307
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">the fact that the I ana the internet</font>

308
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,079
assigned numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Authority the</font>

track of names numbers and protocols and

00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:41,530
parameter numbers throughout the history

312
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:45,339
of the internet is<font color="#E5E5E5"> undergoing a change</font>

313
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:47,439
and basically presently the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono</font>

314
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:48,910
operates under two different documents

315
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,430
one is a contract with the US government

316
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:56,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that contract is the IANA functions</font>

317
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:59,319
contract it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> provided for in with ntia</font>

318
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of Commerce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia National</font>

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">Telecommunications and infrastructure</font>

320
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:06,520
agency has a contract with<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can for I</font>

321
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:09,010
can to provide these iono registry

322
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,620
services the registry services are

323
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,140
keeping track of a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

324
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:16,150
tables that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use in real</font>

325
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,720
time but are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very important for</font>

326
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:23,290
coordination so for example the DNS root

327
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:27,370
zone is one of those tables the ipv4

328
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:29,620
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and asn free pools both 32 and 64</font>

329
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:34,390
are iono tables that are being

330
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:37,420
maintained actually dns and IP of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

331
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:40,660
smaller number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tables amazingly</font>

332
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:43,630
there's about a thousand IETF parameter

333
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:46,780
tables so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything from bgp</font>

334
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:49,750
options to mime types to every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

336
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,680
in a consideration section these are the

337
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,120
people that maintain the table and put

338
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,930
it on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye on a website make it</font>

339
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,040
available as<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML etc etc so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in some ways</font>

340
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,380
this

341
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,209
critical function because it prevents us

342
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,759
from stomping on each other it makes

343
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:08,768
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that port 80 is for</font>

344
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,920
one thing in port 25 is for something

345
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:14,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">else but in another way it's offline</font>

346
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,800
meaning once you know what you're going

347
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:19,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">to code on port 80 or 443 or 25 or once</font>

348
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,579
you know where you're going to get the

349
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS root zone from it's not very</font>

350
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:26,709
important as long as it's there and

351
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,959
reliable<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the US</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> government has</font>

354
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,819
the IETF since 2000 has also had a

355
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">contract I actually say the IETF has had</font>

356
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:42,579
an MoU a memorandum of understanding

357
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:44,500
which calls for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iono to provide the</font>

359
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,730
services as well people read these

360
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:50,680
documents and some people say they

361
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:53,350
overlap a hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent some people</font>

362
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,019
say they overlap<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty-five percent but</font>

363
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:59,829
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> both out there one is RFC 2860</font>

364
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:02,199
and one is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ik nnti a website so</font>

365
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:04,420
the iono does its job an<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

366
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,870
coordination for all of us because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,000
these two relationships the US

374
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:30,160
multi-stakeholder community is not and

375
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,930
transitioning oversight is a very

376
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,180
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing when you issue a</font>

00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,019
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy thing to do a contract so it was</font>

381
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,819
kind of hard trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what</font>

382
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:48,160
the US government actually wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

have happen other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the fact that it</font>

well they're stabilizing but every now

412
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,550
and then they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> something pretty</font>

413
00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:01,990
surreal they decide unilaterally to take

action and so globally this stabilizing

415

figure out how to replace the<font color="#E5E5E5"> function</font>

the function of contracting that this

that us<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia does with a community-based</font>

function to provide the same effective

have an<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono performing but instead of</font>

it answers to quote all of us questions

480
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,200
let's see one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

481
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,149
think about here is this is the most

00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,669
important transition the Internet's ever

483
00:19:46,149 --> 00:19:50,619
going to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it is the least</font>

00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:53,169
important transition the Internet's ever

485
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:55,928
going to go through so from the least

486
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:59,740
important perspective folks this doesn't

487
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:01,179
matter ietf<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can and the rirs know if</font>

488
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,919
the I Anna does its job on a

489
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:04,509
week-to-week basis we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> great working</font>

490
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,119
relationships with the I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna team and</font>

491
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:10,299
there's already SLA reporting for

492
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:13,360
example both in the contract and in the

493
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:16,149
IETF process so the I eat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICANN is</font>

494
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,519
very accountable and if anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to</font>

495
00:20:16,149 --> 00:20:20,439
go wrong like they didn't update the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn</font>

496
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:23,679
registry or they didn't update the dns

497
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:27,490
root zone the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that directly give</font>

498
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:30,159
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy the rirs I can and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF</font>

499
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:32,919
would quickly notice and be right on top

500
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,500
of making it happen so in that way it's

501
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">the least important transition really</font>

502
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,290
doesn't matter because the customers who

503
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,830
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inr going to make sure</font>

504
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:44,770
is fine now it's the most important

505
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:46,560
transition because right now the ability

506
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:50,230
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government contract for this</font>

507
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:52,840
gives it the ability not to contract if

508
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,940
the IRS were to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a ditch and</font>

509
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:57,760
collectively make a very bad decision

510
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,100
contrary to community<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if the ietf</font>

511
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,379
were to do something similar or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

512
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,730
were to do something similar right now

513
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,650
you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go the US</font>

514
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:07,810
government and go this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all working</font>

515
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:10,930
fine except that and because of that

516
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:14,530
issue whatever that is do not renew the

517
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:18,100
contract with ayana until<font color="#CCCCCC"> parenthesis I</font>

518
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:20,500
can comma<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF comma or rirs get their</font>

519
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,030
act together and begin behaving like

520
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:25,840
they're supposed to an accountable

521
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:28,629
manner to us a coincidence of changing

522
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,810
this function is you'll never have that

523
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,240
ability to go to a party outside the

524
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:37,240
system to complain that the system isn't

525
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,220
working so in that way this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

526
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,510
very important you want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

527
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:43,510
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these entities are</font>

528
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:45,310
appropriately accountable to you before

529
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,379
we actually get to the point of getting

530
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:49,510
the US government out of the picture ok

531
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:54,210
questions and I can take one if i read

532
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:55,960
this clock correctly go any questions

533
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,940
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an hour</font>
