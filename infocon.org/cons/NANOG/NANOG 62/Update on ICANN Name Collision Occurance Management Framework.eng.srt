community there to handle name

00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:33,680
collisions or address name collisions so

9
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:36,559
I'm gonna start<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk out this is</font>

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,510
pretty brief talk talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,860
name collision what we're trying to

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,629
address for those you haven't been

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,400
familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then i'll talk</font>

14
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:44,629
about control interruptions give you a

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,729
definition of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it is what we're</font>

16
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:47,960
trying to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it and then what it</font>

17
00:00:46,729 --> 00:00:49,760
means basically to the operator

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,519
community what you might see of it and

19
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,589
what you might want to do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

20
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:57,019
the what happens is there's a lot of

21
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:59,360
queries going out to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public dns for</font>

22
00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:01,540
top-level domains that don't exist so

23
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on forever like that example and</font>

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,840
these crews go out there there's no

25
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:08,840
answer they get back at there's no such

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,310
name out there and then the sender deals

27
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,020
with that they could fall back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,950
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and they finally get to</font>

29
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,970
where they're going in lot of times

30
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:16,250
people don't even notice this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

31
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,439
happening it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just takes a little bit of</font>

32
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,579
time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notice that either</font>

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,100
there's sometimes evidence that people

34
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:25,100
who will go off of the reservation<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to</font>

35
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,689
a free Wi-Fi don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn on VPN and they</font>

36
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,699
will leak the same kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of queries out</font>

37
00:01:26,689 --> 00:01:32,419
there so we see names appearing in the

38
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns that shouldn't be out there yet why</font>

39
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,929
does this happen that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are two</font>

40
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:39,399
basic reasons for this that we come

41
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:41,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">across one is people just adopting names</font>

42
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,909
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's from installing new</font>

43
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,499
software there's an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example set up you</font>

44
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">just copy that because you figure it's</font>

45
00:01:45,499 --> 00:01:49,490
all local to you I don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

46
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,259
public<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so i'll just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep it local</font>

47
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,810
and that's where some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the names are</font>

48
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,030
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> from another root cause for this</font>

49
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:57,530
is the use of search lists search list

50
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,810
of something where they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been around</font>

51
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,789
for a long time they're inconsistent you

52
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,530
put in a partial name the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them</font>

53
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:06,829
gets filled in automatically you ask for

54
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:08,300
that name out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there these two cause</font>

55
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:09,350
names that go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to the dns sometimes</font>

56
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,080
that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be out</font>

57
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:16,130
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have these potential for</font>

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,330
collisions now all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is happening and</font>

59
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,280
if he goes along with anything really

60
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:21,890
getting noticed it's fine but someday

61
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,830
the TLD that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to may</font>

62
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,079
actually appear in the public dns

63
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,360
is now defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> this here the dot example</font>

64
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,770
suddenly is put there those two users

65
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,850
out there that we're getting no answer

66
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:32,680
for this and<font color="#CCCCCC"> going back to somewhere</font>

67
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:35,380
else are now getting an answer and they

68
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,780
may be going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the wrong place they</font>

69
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,340
make any different answers and this is

70
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,870
going to be an interruption to

71
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,310
operations it's going to cause things

72
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,040
not to work the way they're expected to

73
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,930
work today at best you can have to fix

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,600
this to get going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to where you want</font>

75
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,180
to be at worst it<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually result in</font>

76
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:55,019
data flowing out of the network into

77
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:58,180
somebody else who's reserved that name

78
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,610
now to avoid this how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have this</font>

79
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">threads from happening to yourself first</font>

thing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of principles out there</font>

81
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:06,700
use fully qualified domain names of

82
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:08,220
spell the name all the way out there use

83
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,149

this may not solve all of your problems

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:51,130
the designs for this basically it's

going to be news it's a nuisance it's

no collateral damage from doing this we

109

don't want data to go to all the places

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:18,280
be indications that you have queries

146
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,780
going out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your network that you</font>

147
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,369
really don't intend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have go out there</font>

148
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:25,570
because some point is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause you</font>

149
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,920
a bigger problem so what to do my<font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

150
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:31,030
bullet here's a little bit misleading I

151
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,280
have belief of demonstrable severe harm

152
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,559
actually we're looking for any reports

153
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,630
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience a problem with this</font>

154
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,190
if you see these queries come back to

155
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,500
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you feel like it you can tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

156
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it right now we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only have about a</font>

157
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,760
dozen or so reports out there

158
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:47,290
statistically doesn't say much I'm sure

159
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,060
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of this being seen out</font>

160
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:50,530
there but we don't know what we can't

161
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,510
say much with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 reports we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have now</font>

162
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:55,179
this will help us refine the process if

163
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,370
you do see this and just let us know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

164
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,800
the URL for reporting that is going to

165
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,570
be is up there now for further

166
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,370
information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we have much more</font>

167
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:04,900
written about this a topic a lot of it's

168
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,680
geared towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the registries and</font>

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,539
registrar community that I can serves

170
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,130
there's a the next file there is more

171
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,330
comprehensive in describing this problem

172
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,940
what you can do to get around it and

173
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:20,020
finally and the last bullet on this page

174
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:21,340
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have another website which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

frequently asked question pages out

178
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,280
there you go there look up what you have

179
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,030
questions about look for different

180
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,429
instructions out there and some of these

181
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:36,640
other resources so I've actually gone

182

really fast about<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike you a slide so if</font>

185
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,270
the URL<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that mitigation paper the</font>

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:09,280
comma<font color="#CCCCCC"> separated value file which has a</font>

it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come it's there's</font>

203
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,469
agreements in place for it and also if

204
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,539
its delegated we have the date of its

205
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,770
delegation in the root zone so you can

206
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:25,930
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and say when did this problem</font>

207
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:28,990
start you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> started with this TLD</font>

208
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:32,440
coming online with that I'll go with

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:35,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions Scott library</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter so my</font>

210
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,000
main question is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hostnames what</font>

211
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:39,880
domain requests are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

212
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this on I heard a generic answer</font>

213
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:44,289
but not specific is this going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to relate</font>

214
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to things that people commonly type into</font>

215
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,009
search engines that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then get looked up</font>

216
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,780
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure if that's a</font>

217
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:53,289
hostname or a search term is it going to

218
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,929
be dub dub dub dot random top-level

219
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:59,020
domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what are you doing this on</font>

220
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:03,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so let's say if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to a web</font>

221
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:06,310
browser and type in ww let's example is

222
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:07,509
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones out there the web</font>

223
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:10,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">browsers going to come back trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

224
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:12,219
make an attempt to 120 70 50 53 53

225
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:14,830
that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the address record</font>

226
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:17,710
the v4 address record why is dubbed the

227
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,900
company that example resolving to 53 53

228
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:22,508
that's the part I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get oh because</font>

229
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,099
you asked for it no why did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide</font>

230
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:27,550
as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS operators that that</font>

231
00:08:24,099 --> 00:08:29,770
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> host name deserves to be sent</font>

232
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,020
to this address as opposed to something

233
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:34,208
run by the TLD opposite so what's got us

234
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,130
sick from dot examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> odd example</font>

235
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,020
operator they set up operations right

236
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,630
away they put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first zone file out</font>

237
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,399
there they're gonna have a wild<font color="#E5E5E5"> card</font>

238
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,078
right so everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes some</font>

239
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,880
solid sample was not running say she's a

240
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:47,890
wild card<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything that's not actually</font>

241
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,779
registered is supposed to go here right

242
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,399
the caveat here is for anything that's

243
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:54,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">not running today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will have the wild</font>

244
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">card option this is a detail it's really</font>

245
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:58,180
not that important to the operator

246
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,520
community but i'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you know anything</font>

247
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that hasn't started operating today wild</font>

248
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,590
card goes out everything

249
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,300
back if it's been running for a few

250
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,010
months and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has certain names that</font>

251
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,900
we're concerned about those things

252
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,720
specifically are going to respond this

253
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:14,310
way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to overtime that's</font>

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,590
going to go away that's kind of just a

255
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,910
can handle the older<font color="#CCCCCC"> tlds that are</font>

256
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:23,880
really running and have possibilities of

positive<font color="#E5E5E5"> responses coming out hey erik</font>

259
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,670
quick question have you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys um started</font>

260
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,100
to think about maybe proactively

261
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,420
reaching out to queries that you see

262
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,160
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe aren't like watching their</font>

263
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,770
logs carefully enough to find you know

264
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,990
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ty 70 50 53 and maybe just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let them</font>

265
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:41,069
know hey we saw you asking for stuff and

266
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,480
we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you ought to be worried or</font>

267
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,750
anything like that is there any plans or

268
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,490
thinking around that the difficulty is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

269
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,470
believe a little difficulty is that

270
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,180
where these<font color="#CCCCCC"> words</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to is not</font>

271
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,970
one central places to the TL DS out

272
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,849
there they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be able to do it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

273
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,320
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the access to that data I</font>

274
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:01,200
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have access to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that data</font>

275
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,230
right away that's a good suggestion i'll

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,550
see if see if there is any provision for

277
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,589
having a TLD to try to reach out to

278
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,270
people like I in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> case I really</font>

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,469
system that's got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> search list and so</font>

285
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,510
on configured within a domain and walk

286
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:29,610
out of the building it's not the

287
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,319
resolvers fault of the resolver when

288
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,839
they walked out of the building that has

289
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,330
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so it's not actually the DNS</font>

290
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,540
resolver operator that sexually the

291
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:42,390
cause of these silly queries at the root

292
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,370
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end machines which are</font>

293
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:47,490
walking into particularly public domains

294
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,010
from private domains and that makes them

295
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,930
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really hard to catch because in</font>

296
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,000
essence in the public domain they're

297
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:55,680
anonymous they've been given an address

298
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,380
to sure they're wandering around a Wi-Fi

299
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,010
hotspot who cares you can't track this

300
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:03,210
down so in some ways you're spending a

301
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,100
lot of effort if you go down the

302
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,470
resolver path and you're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

303
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,600
find anything because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

304
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,240
there that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of a permanent signal</font>

305
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,430
of a mal configuration of the DNS this

306
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,070
is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a mobile device and</font>

307
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:18,959
walking<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the front door right this is</font>

308
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:20,370
a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> because a DSS so resilient it</font>

309
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,589
doesn't care you can ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anything in</font>

310
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:24,000
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall back and that's actually what's</font>

311
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,250
happening cases a search list you're

312
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,510
falling back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other places so what</font>

313
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,460
this is doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to put bed comes</font>

314
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:33,300
in all the other systems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are making</font>

315
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:35,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">Zaire inquiries that's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hope yeah do</font>

316
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:39,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">you see you see TCP connections at 120</font>

317
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:41,550
70 5053 you got a problem you know I'm

318
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:43,529
old enough to remember the<font color="#E5E5E5"> furore that</font>

319
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:46,020
was created<font color="#E5E5E5"> when someone decided to put</font>

320
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,880
a wild card in the comms own and

321
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,620
everyone decided that this was the

322
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,140
ultimate heresy and how dare they do

323
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,720
that site finder or something and yet

324
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:59,370
these days I can is actively advocating

325
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:05,730
this cool yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say there is a</font>

326
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:12,209
waiver for that place for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this yes yeah</font>

327
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:14,430
yep see any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay one</font>

328
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:19,020
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> time quitting you got away 39 12</font>

329

seconds few minutes 11 seconds like the

330
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,310
big question I guess is why does thank

331
00:12:21,029 --> 00:12:27,839
wide as I can feel that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cans</font>

332
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,489

333
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">cain't community sense we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

334
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,940
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

335
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,820
successful we want to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that new</font>

336
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">TVs come in with minimum harm to those</font>

337
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,529
that are existing today now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we</font>

338
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,150
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a system where you</font>

339
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:44,310
have a let's say you have a system which

340
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,500
is trying to connect out the door and

341
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,939
someone come and say hey if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I register</font>

342
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,250
this name this new TLD i can start

343
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,839
pulling off your traffic we we kind of

344
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,690
want to give everyone a chance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

345
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,950
let's fix this up let's do the basic

346
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,360
let's fix the network make sure it's

347
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,190
doing the right thing and letting you

348
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,990
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so that we don't start</font>

349
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,260
sending sensitive data out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the wrong</font>

350
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">place</font>

351
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:20,180
okay so no more questions send your

352
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:22,830
questions to 127 dot 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oh def</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

353
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,069
by the way a little close one thing we

354
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,660
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a v6 address you know I've</font>

355
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,710
repeat us as before a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> times here</font>

356
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,350
no one asked me about that was kind of

357
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:33,510
surprised v6 doesn't have a loopback

358
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,040
address we can borrow like this v6 has

359
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:39,660
one on loopback address which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

360
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,800
v4 had a /<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 for this so suggestions for</font>

361
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:45,900
v6 sweet Kubek address be appreciated so

well you know you you run the root of

363
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:53,490
the name space filling the number space

364
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:57,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay wait thanks very much it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hey</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>
