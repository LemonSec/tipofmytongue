00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,300
technologies and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> here to talk</font>

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:27,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to engineer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Sdn in genie</font>

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:31,230
network<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genie is a virtual laboratory</font>

6
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:35,170
for people to do networking and

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,530
distributed operations research and

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:43,510
education we started about five years

9
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:46,749
ago and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been building a network</font>

10
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,640
of resources which are autonomously

11
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:54,460
owned by different contributors to

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jeanne the the project as a whole goes</font>

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,359
forward in yearly cycles so people will

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:02,079
bring new technologies new ideas new

15
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,809
software into the come into the project

16
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,820
for a year people will integrate deploy

17
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,020
evaluate and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at</font>

18
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and decide whether</font>

19
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">to continue or not and whether to</font>

20
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">transition things from prototype to</font>

21
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:21,548
further use and into production

22
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,798
deployment experimenters use the test

23
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:25,240
bed while we're building<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out so like</font>

24
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:27,490
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the networks that you build</font>

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,539
it's being stressed while it's being

26
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:35,079
used and the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

27
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:37,869
have a vote in in what will stay and

28
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:39,880
what will go on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network the two</font>

the fundamentals<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how we build the</font>

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,178
network are slicing the data plane

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,340
horizontally so everybody who brings a

33
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:50,859
resource also brings a way to connect to

34
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,740
the to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data plane which is a base</font>

35
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:54,969
which is mostly a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to data plane</font>

36
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:57,969
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're going to talk about</font>

37
00:01:54,969 --> 00:02:00,579
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's a vertical</font>

38
00:01:57,969 --> 00:02:04,390
control plane API which you use to

39
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:06,520
access those resources this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture</font>

40
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,979
of how<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeanne looked when we started a</font>

41
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,900
few years ago the resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were</font>

42
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:17,550
contributed were open flow switches

43
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:20,420
servers that could run virtual nodes

44
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,830
virtual machines

45
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:25,230
regional networks basically the states

46
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you see colored in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> providing</font>

47
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:31,319
access for<font color="#E5E5E5"> over pieces of their</font>

48
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:35,609
infrastructure and there were two core

49
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,760
networks that were providing nationwide

50
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:42,150
spanning connectivity that was internet

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">too and national lambda rail as you know</font>

52
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,349
national lambda<font color="#E5E5E5"> rail or as you may know</font>

53
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,900
national lambda<font color="#E5E5E5"> L is no longer operating</font>

54
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:53,880
so the core of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network is now just</font>

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,980
provided by internet too so what we do

56
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:59,910
is take that infrastructure and slice<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

57
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,500
up by experimenters so that people can

58
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,819
share the same infrastructure but do

59
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,530
completely different things run

60
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,548
completely different protocols and

61
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:11,280
different services on it and those

62
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:12,870
slices are as much as possible isolated

63
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,840
from each other with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology that</font>

64
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've got to build them on and then</font>

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,920
experimenters can actually download

66
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,670
their own software into the network to

67
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,738
program down to the lower levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

68
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,929
switches and down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lower levels of</font>

69
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,519
either<font color="#CCCCCC"> the virtual machines or the</font>

70
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,410
hardware based servers that they've

71
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,819
gotten the network to try new

72
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:38,400
applications and protocols and services

73
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:40,138
so in order to access the genie

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,720
resources first of all it's open to

75
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:44,970
anyone who has an interest in research

76
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,239
or engineering integration so you don't

77
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,730
have to be from<font color="#CCCCCC"> University it's fine to</font>

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,560
be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> genie anybody from the nanog</font>

doing experiments on and off or or

91
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:28,110
continuously on the network and we span

92
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,750
about fifty two campuses a couple of

93
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,580
enterprise networks but enterprises are

94
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,840
still fairly minor in terms of what

95
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,909
they're contributing

96
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">11 regionals and 10 wireless sites the</font>

101
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:56,580
combination of both so we run these

102
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:58,380
experiments continuously 24 7 365 and we

103
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,530
support operations with six different

109
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,919
little bit about software in order to

110
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:23,550
use your credentials and access the

111
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,099
resources we operate a piece of software

112
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,780
which we group together as the portal

113
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,310
and clearing house so there's a web

114
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,200
interface to this and there's also a

115
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,449
programmable interface to this clearing

116
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,550
house and basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearinghouse</font>

117
00:05:33,449 --> 00:05:37,139
software which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source and</font>

118
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,870
publicly available for anyone who's

119
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:42,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in it it keeps track of the</font>

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,220
users and the projects and the slices

121
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,280

will return to you your credentials to

148
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,539
objective is to let experimenters run

149
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,280
their own Sdn controllers so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">different than a lot of networks that</font>

153
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,979
want to give access to people at the

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:24,508
operate networks can run their own

156
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,250

157
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:28,590

will support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so operators may</font>

160
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,169
choose to run a controller and then

161
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:41,729
experimenters run secondary controllers

162
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:44,520

00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,030
to dynamically make connections between

168
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:59,930
endpoints the three types of

169
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:02,369

170
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,889
dedicated<font color="#CCCCCC"> vlans where you have one VLAN</font>

part of an experiment and those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

174
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:17,969
controlled<font color="#E5E5E5"> by one open flow controller</font>

175
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:20,250
or a shared VLAN where you use that VLAN

176
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:21,719
to connect multiple resources and then

177
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,289
you can have multiple people running

178
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:27,300
controllers to share control an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:38,250
nodes into and out of the experiment

183
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:40,320
over time based on demand and so you'd

184
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,899
be running multiples another thing

185
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,500
that's useful for us as operators is you

186
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:48,779
can run a controller that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

187
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,880
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at what's going on in a slice so</font>

188
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:56,430
even though the infrastructure for<font color="#CCCCCC"> genie</font>

189
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,850
is pretty well defined and not as

190
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,439
dynamic as Sdn can be with a controller

191
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:03,210
you still need a view into

192
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,890
each one of those slices if there are

193
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,620
problems with those slices so shared

194
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:09,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">VLANs are good for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to look at</font>

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,440
what's going on in a slice without being

196
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,170

197
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:19,470

213
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:01,020
see how the VLAN stitching works and

214
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:03,839
again this is all open source interfaces

215
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,610
and open source<font color="#CCCCCC"> software and then</font>

216
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,280
there's a special aggregate just to

217
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,650
manage open flow which we call foam and

218
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,250
this is the link<font color="#CCCCCC"> to foam the primary</font>

219
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:17,400
purchase purpose of foam is actually not

220
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,140
to control the vlans it's to allow

221
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are opening up their</font>

222
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,810

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,480
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to approve or not approve</font>

224
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,969
connections into their resources so you

225
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,160
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the foam aggregate manager</font>

226
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,950
software to define patterns that you're

227
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay with approving or to look at every</font>

00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:38,910
single request and individually approve

229
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,820
those are not approved based on what's

230
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,850
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN so this helps</font>

239
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:12,660
doesn't look so great on the projection

but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the slides you</font>

241
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">can see the details about the interfaces</font>

242
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:21,120
and what we were doing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">particular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network we support lots of</font>

245
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:28,980
be interoperable we support interfaces

246
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,200
from one gigabit to 100 gigabits there's

247
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,540
no Sdn interface that operates at 100

248
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,790
gigabits right now the high she can go

249
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,670
is 40 but we share links with other

250
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:45,930
research programs so that's why the

251
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:47,040
hundred gig is is on the list and one

252
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:48,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing that's interesting about our</font>

253
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,630
network is we're still<font color="#E5E5E5"> running on open</font>

254
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,070
flow one point oh and those of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

255
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,700
guess everyone in the room who's been

256
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,990
assaulted<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the openflow hype you would</font>

257
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that everyone would be running</font>

258
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:02,370
open flow 1.3 by now but it turns out

259
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,780
that when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

260
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:06,050
multi-vendor network and you're trying

261
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work with a lot of network aggregates</font>

262
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,349
1.3 is still early<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in development</font>

263
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though it has a lot of great</font>

264
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,390
functionality so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> still running at</font>

265
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:19,860
one point oh and hoping to move ahead

266
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:21,569
with 1.3 later in the year we use

267
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,790
standard internet for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our control plane</font>

268
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,740
so all the benefits and<font color="#E5E5E5"> disadvantages</font>

269
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:28,709
that go along with that apply to our

270
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:33,090
control plane but so far it's been it's

271
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:35,220
been working<font color="#E5E5E5"> well and then we use two</font>

272
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:38,340
services from internet 24 cross connects

273
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,590
one is called ion which allows you to

274
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,960
create and destroy<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs to connect you</font>

275
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:45,530
to that core network and another is

276
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,670
called the advanced layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 service</font>

277
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:49,439

three popular controllers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we see on</font>

289
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:24,279
geni flood light box and open daylight I

290
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:28,139
think floodlight and pucks are probably

291
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:30,189
quite a bit more popular and then

292
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,920
operators on geni are contributing

293
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:35,079
software so operations in sdn is still a

294
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,180
very active thing that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

295
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:40,750
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and do collaboratively with</font>

296
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:44,500
other system engineers and network

297
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,209
engineers and administrators so a lot of

301

302
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,519
aren't Sdn affecting what you do for

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,220
routing and forwarding so you have to

304
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:05,440
disable spanning tree protocol and

people trying to explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them why</font>

309
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,920
that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and figuring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:45,880
hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been an issue yet but obviously</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with scaling it could get to be a</font>

325
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:51,010
problem we have some operations tools to

look for loops and to look for<font color="#E5E5E5"> heavy</font>

00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:57,130

most of the support for limiting things

00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,269
in stn switch is is still very early on

332
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:10,030
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really something you can rely on</font>

333
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:13,750
if you have to cut something off

334
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:15,370
quickly another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to watch out for</font>

335
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,410
is you need to compare the firewall

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:21,070
rules in the data plane this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

337
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:22,660
like regular networking except the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN</font>

338
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,400
rules since they allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

346
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:44,080
you're supporting the API the standard

API and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeanne and the last thing to</font>

348
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,310
notice probably most of you who've

00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,290
touched<font color="#E5E5E5"> sdn already know but this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

350
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,780
major thorn in our side is partial

351
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,610
implementations so almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody who</font>

352
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,600
does an SDN switch still does a partial

353
00:15:54,610 --> 00:16:00,220
implementation and if you're making an

354
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">interoperable network with six or seven</font>

355
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">different providers you're laying those</font>

356
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,060
all over top of each other and sometimes

357
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,890
it's really hard to find an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-to-end</font>

358
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:11,050
path that will work with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

359
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:13,540
types of modifications that different

360
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:16,180
people want to do in their packet fields

361
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:20,849
so you have to keep a careful eye on

362
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:23,140
that so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a real live</font>

363
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,950
experiment that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran and real life</font>

364
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:31,060
problems that we had and tim is is going

365
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:33,190
to tell you what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened one exciting</font>

366
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,069
day when he woke up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that there</font>

367
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:38,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">were was an issue on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> genie and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spent</font>

368
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:42,520
quite a while trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to track</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that down</font>

369
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,810
so Tim what was it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw that led</font>

370
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:49,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to believe that there was an issue</font>

371
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:50,979
in this network um so yep so the

372
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,719
previous slide was kind of showing the

373
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the paths that we had to deal with the</font>

374
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,310
layer two paths and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

375
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,199
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more so showing the active</font>

376
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,510
monitoring that we were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

377
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:03,820
can see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> test points attached to some</font>

378
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:07,930
of the or going off<font color="#E5E5E5"> of some of the core</font>

379
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:10,600
nodes and we could tell that some of the

380
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:13,330
traffic following the blue line from

381
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:17,260
that the BBN node up in the top right

382
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:18,609
corner was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting through to the to</font>

383
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,339
the test point in the Seattle node and

384
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:22,629
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a sporadic drop so I mean</font>

385
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the you know the sporadic problems are</font>

386
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,620
always fun to deal with

387
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,260
and we also saw a couple of problems

388
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,419
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Chicago the test point hang</font>

389
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:34,690
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> cago of Chicago but not quite as</font>

390
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:37,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">many and we also had another operations</font>

391
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:40,059
group who was actually has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

392
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">more access to those switches and they</font>

393
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,389
were getting cpu alarms for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Denver</font>

394
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,250
switch so it was pretty clear that

395
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,559
something was wrong and it seemed highly

396
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,480
likely that the whatever was causing the

397
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">CPU problems on the switch was also</font>

398
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:54,370
resulting in the traffic drops we were

399
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,990
seeing in the data plane so next up<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

400
00:17:54,370 --> 00:18:01,540
trying to isolate the problem what did

401
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:07,840
you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that we didn't rehearse this</font>

402
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:09,570
right no the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah sorry so we</font>

403
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,860
went through this sort of nice little

404
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,770
diagram here although of course when you

405
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,120
have your problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network the</font>

406
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:17,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">the problem space is more like the world</font>

407
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,750
and you have to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of constraint it</font>

408
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:21,850
down so it wasn't quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> this simple it</font>

409
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:25,510
wasn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> following</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the path but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

410
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,770
know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that now so like I said</font>

411
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,840
before we assumed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a</font>

412
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,210
correlation between the the high cpu

413
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,980
usage on the denver switch and the

414
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:34,960
problem that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was causing traffic to get</font>

415
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,250
dropped in the data plane and so at that

416
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">point we were just trying to figure out</font>

417
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:42,730
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was causing the the high cpu usage</font>

418
00:18:39,309 --> 00:18:46,000
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> switch and just having dealt with</font>

419
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:48,040
this in the past before typical problems

420
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,960
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be somebody was overwhelming the</font>

421
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,879
control plane by sending too much

422
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,230
traffic to the controller or injecting a

423
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,290
bunch of traffic into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network from</font>

424
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:59,470
the controller the switch<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs you know</font>

425
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,540
they're still not that high grade so the

426
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,679
the agents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the open</font>

427
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">flow process can sometimes get</font>

428
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,400
overwhelmed by that and you know we kind

429
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,720
of investigated that for a while we

430
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,460
didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good baseline so it was</font>

431
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,830
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell if that was actually the</font>

432
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,690
problem but we thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe okay</font>

433
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:16,389
it this<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't seem like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the main</font>

434
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:17,679
problem and so then we moved on to

435
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,220
looking at things like the partial

436
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,929
implementations at Heidi was mentioning

437
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,460
sometimes the switches will implement a

438
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,840
feature and sometimes they won't but

439
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,250
then there's a third<font color="#E5E5E5"> category which is</font>

440
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes they'll implement it in</font>

441
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,600
software and that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really well</font>

442
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:33,309
advertised through the protocol but

443
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,530
usually the documentation can tell you

444
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:36,200
the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> sheet for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the switch will tell</font>

445
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,610
you you know

446
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,559
particular features implemented in

447
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,059
software so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through and</font>

448
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">look at this particular data sheet and</font>

449
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:45,139
then check some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tables in the</font>

450
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,659
switch and see well our is any of this

451
00:19:45,139 --> 00:19:49,789
at all going into the software path and

452
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:52,580
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of tough to see the obvious</font>

453
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:54,470
ones that we had seen before things like

454
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,510
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing IP rewrites we knew</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

455
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,769
was in the software path people flooding

456
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:59,269
a lot of traffic we knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was in the</font>

457
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:02,269
software path and we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

458
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:03,799
any of that so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of changed up how</font>

459
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:06,289
we were searching for<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and we</font>

460
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,090
looked for specifically which of these

461
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:09,740
correspond to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> software table and</font>

462
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:10,939
then once we did that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that was</font>

463
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,309
a nice shortcut we should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that</font>

464
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:14,779
from the beginning but once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> did that</font>

465
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,700
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was pretty easy to identify that</font>

466
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,620
there was this weird forwarding rule

467
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,970
that was sending traffic back out on the

468
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,120
port that it came in on which was

469
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,710
another thing that happens in software

470
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,010
so once we figured that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out it was it</font>

471
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:29,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">was pretty that getting to that point</font>

472
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:31,158
took the most time and once we did that

473
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:33,919
it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot less kind of flailing</font>

474
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:37,070
around but it was easy to sort of

475
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,779
methodically go through things like okay

476
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,129
well who does now that we know the

477
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">forwarding rule who does that belong to</font>

478
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:43,370
well we found it belong to us which is

479
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:47,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a good thing because it makes</font>

480
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:49,100
it easier to debug we restarted our

481
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:51,769
controller which didn't help remove any

482
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,990
weird flow rules we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we restarted the</font>

483
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:56,029
Denver switch because this was affecting

484
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:57,380
other experimenters and we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

485
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,690
resolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as quickly as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible and</font>

486
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:02,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that didn't seem to help either so at</font>

487
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:03,919
that point we took a<font color="#E5E5E5"> step back and we</font>

488
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,380
kind of wanted to walk through a couple

489
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,820
of sending traffic between a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

490
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,820
the test points can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to the</font>

491
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mm-hmm we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to send</font>

492
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,639
traffic to a couple of the test points

493
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:16,639
like the one in Seattle and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

494
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:19,789
Chicago and in doing that and kind of

495
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:21,918
tracing through each hop along the way

496
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:23,480
we ended<font color="#E5E5E5"> up discovering that there was</font>

497
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,269
traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was supposed to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

498
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,730
this Chicago node the test point in

499
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:31,100
Chicago and it was getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent off to</font>

500
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,889
denver and that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of strange and</font>

501
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,418
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't really explain it so we</font>

502
00:21:33,889 --> 00:21:39,559
started you know we started<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

503
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:40,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">well maybe the Denver switch has the the</font>

504
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:42,470
forwarding rule that's doing the right

505
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:43,669
thing but you know why the heck is that

506
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,169
traffic getting over there in the first

507
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:47,419
place so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

508
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,400
forwarding rules in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chicago</font>

509
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,560
switch

510
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,390
and can't find anything you know

511
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,310
double-check triple-check ask other

512
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,960
people to check ask the people to

513
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:58,389
operate the switch locally to check

514
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,490
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it so it's this phantom</font>

515
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,990
forwarding rule and at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it's</font>

516
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:04,210
pretty clear that you know we have some

517
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,720
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> formwork firmware bug and those</font>

518
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">are always fun to debug but once we</font>

519
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,130
figured that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out we start the show the</font>

520
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chicago switch things recovered the</font>

521
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:15,880
Denver switch is happy again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

522
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,929
was kind of the whole process so it was

523
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,490
a little bit interesting and yeah I I'm

524
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,720
sure it<font color="#CCCCCC"> has some sort of correlations to</font>

525
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:25,900
things that people do in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

526
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,340
non<font color="#CCCCCC"> stn and maybe I have some interest</font>

527
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:33,190
in discussing that of people later on

528
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:35,439
after okay so um these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font>

529
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,230
screenshots of tools open source<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools</font>

530
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,960
that we use to look into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

531
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:42,940
and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems as well I'm sorry</font>

532
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,470
they're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to see but if you</font>

533
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,380
download the presentation and you want

534
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:50,410
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how you can find open flow</font>

535
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:56,170
tables and flow stats these actually

536
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:58,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">match with the example and also the wire</font>

537
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">shek Wireshark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OpenFlow tool is really</font>

538
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:04,240
helpful anything you want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

539
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:05,440
the tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the same</font>

540
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,570
tools that you use<font color="#E5E5E5"> every day they just</font>

541
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">have you know that the Wireshark has a</font>

542
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,500
special detector for open flow and all

543
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,740
the other stuff is going through rest so

544
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:16,150
it's just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know curl and you know</font>

545
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,150
formatting so yeah you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

546
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:27,640
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of scripting and dealing with</font>

547
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:29,230
it but it's worth it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font>

548
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to pick on a particular vendor but i</font>

549
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,910
will tell you HP is a great vendor there

550
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,330
are big partner of ours and this is a

551
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:39,070
picture from their document and the

552
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,189
reason that I'm putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up is to</font>

553
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,530
illustrate what we were saying about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

554
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,800
complexity of the rules in sdn right now

555
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:50,649
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a match by the piece of the</font>

556
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:53,530
packet and the flow type that you'd like

557
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on and the conditions for any</font>

558
00:23:53,530 --> 00:24:00,970
one of these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are blocks to</font>

559
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:03,189
actually be<font color="#CCCCCC"> successful each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these has</font>

560
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:04,780
limits on it and each vendor has a

561
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:06,700
different table a lot of the tables

562
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,830
aren't actually published by the vendors

563
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,679
so the fact that i put HP up there

564
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:13,149
doesn't mean we think HP is bad it just

565
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,539
means they did a better job of

566
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:18,640
documentation than a lot of other people

567
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:21,490
so if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of complication</font>

568
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,820
and then you add multiple vendors you

569
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:27,250
get an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of why working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on s the end</font>

571
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:31,510
engineering challenge it's a great

572
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,389
operations challenge and it's it's early

573
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:37,030
enough in its development<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I hope it</font>

574
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:41,470
would be interesting and appeal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a lot</font>

575
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:43,570
of nanog members things that we're

576
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:49,750
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing next with this in</font>

577
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:53,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">genie as I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned we we expect to</font>

578
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:55,960
migrate to 1.3 we expect to see better

579
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:57,940
support for hybrid networks that means

580
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,659
single switches<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will support both</font>

581
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:04,360
open flow and non open flow flows in the

582
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:06,580
same switch so isolated by interface or

583
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,559
perhaps by VLAN it's done differently

584
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,449
for different vendors but we're getting

585
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where hybrid networking is</font>

586
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:14,590
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of our reality than it</font>

587
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,990
was in stn probably three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font>

588
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:19,658
where it was talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but not really</font>

589
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">done and that's especially important for</font>

590
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:22,360
deployment because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you've got one</font>

591
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,309
piece of hardware that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do both</font>

592
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,469
things then you got more resources that

593
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:31,480
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to you as being things that you</font>

594
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:33,789
can try using Sdn for we have a software

595
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,620
project to separate the network slicing

596
00:25:33,789 --> 00:25:42,730
by VLAN from the rest of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN control</font>

597
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:44,320
functions and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only network</font>

598
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:46,929
slicing by VLAN because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing it</font>

599
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,399
in an open flow environment but instead

600
00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,740
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> having everything in one piece of</font>

601
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,919
software which was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> original flow</font>

602
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:56,289
visor software that came from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stanford</font>

603
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,700
kind of trying to modularize functions

604
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:01,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">into different pieces so that that's</font>

605
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:04,659
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage and upgrade and fix</font>

606
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,090
we're also entering the dreaded phase of

607
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:09,460
policy management again this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

608
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:10,720
problem that's unique to sdn lots of

609
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:14,440
other networking people have dealt with

610
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">it but once you use Sdn and you have</font>

611
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,379
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change what's happening with</font>

612
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,629
the packets in flight you have perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

613
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:24,850
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more variations in what you</font>

614
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:27,370
need to consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> policy management</font>

615
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,320
for people who want to connect that's

616
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:31,928
<font color="#E5E5E5">just starting up this year really</font>

617
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:39,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">seriously as a software and technology</font>

618
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:40,750
effort we're seeing Sdn start to show up

619
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:45,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">in some of the broadband and home</font>

620
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:46,960
networks Nick theme stir who's spoken at

621
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:49,149
nanog before is involved in some

622
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,919
projects like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on genie and it's</font>

623
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:54,580
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up in some of the</font>

624
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:57,580
metropolitan areas so that's exciting

625
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:59,289
and new especially for the folks who

626
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:02,500
want to do application development in

627
00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:05,379
homes we're seeing people start to work

628
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,909
on Sdn exchange points there are two of

629
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:09,100
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are under development now</font>

630
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:10,750
right now they're just between research

631
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:13,029
and engineering organizations but

632
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,879
there's talk of being able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> branch out</font>

633
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:17,649
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is centered in</font>

634
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:19,959
northwestern and one is centered in

635
00:27:17,649 --> 00:27:22,000
Georgia Tech so if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

636
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,220
either of those things let us know we'd

637
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,620
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have more participation from</font>

638
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,409
people who are have<font color="#CCCCCC"> had experience with</font>

00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:31,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">this stuff in nanog before and of course</font>

640
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:32,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">you need cross-domain monitoring if</font>

you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run cross domain</font>

642
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:36,700

643
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:39,009
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really need</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look into the slice especially at</font>

645
00:27:39,009 --> 00:27:42,820
this stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> of open flow development to</font>

646
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,679
see what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on you need monitoring</font>

647
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,720
tools that allow people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share that</font>

648
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:49,179
information you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to just open</font>

649
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,549
up everything in your network to other

650
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:53,759
Sdn providers particularly if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

651
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:56,279
a in a competitive commercial landscape

652
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,899
but you need a way to share information

653
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:00,700
that everybody needs when they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

654
00:27:58,899 --> 00:28:03,070
debug something like an SDN exchange

655
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,809
problem so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the little picture of</font>

656
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:09,730
an architecture that we're trying out in

657
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jeanne and we sort of have a</font>

658
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:15,970
standardized process for deploying and

659
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:17,620
testing Sdn nodes and Jeannie and I put

660
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:20,309
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> links into those if people are</font>

661
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:24,580
interested in coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed and</font>

662
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:26,230
participating on this is the last set of

663
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,710
things that we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

664
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:31,580
standardized and

665
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:33,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> SDN stuff possible to manage we</font>

666
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,980
document all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tests we do we document</font>

667
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,720
the network we run sdn gear through

668
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,640
acceptance testing to make sure it will

669
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,080
at least do the basics of what we need

670
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:48,169
to put sdn paths across different

671
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:49,970
resource providers and all of this stuff

672
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:55,940
is available on the website if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

673
00:28:49,970 --> 00:29:00,110
to see more details so with that we're

674
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:02,450
open to questions hi Ralph meulen

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i get to know every network admin</font>

in a way to debug it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

681
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:17,779
anticipate was that I kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

682
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,390
needed permission from every single

<font color="#E5E5E5">network operator in between and it</font>

684
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:24,140
reminded me kind of the bad old days

685
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:26,390
before packet switching when you had to

686
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:29,870
get a circuit from the phone company is

687
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:32,990
it too late<font color="#CCCCCC"> to bake openness in the</font>

688
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:34,850
architecture to be by default permissive

689
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:37,070
be by default liberal and what you

690
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:41,240
accept so we don't need permission and

691
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:43,460
can just experiment um well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll say my</font>

692
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:45,529
opinion then you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say Europe and I</font>

693
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:47,720
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's too light at all I</font>

694
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:49,580
think we've been we've been trying to

695
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:52,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that pre provisioning and that</font>

696
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:54,770
allocation step to be separated<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

697
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,080
when people use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and frankly</font>

698
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,270
we've been running so fast that there

699
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,360
isn't much of a delay a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the time</font>

700
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,789
so I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a goal and</font>

701
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,889
the administrators are getting more

702
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:08,990
comfortable with it at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints and</font>

703
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:11,480
so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can keep getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them more</font>

704
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:14,899
comfortable with it and avoid you know

705
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,880
major issues on the network then most of

706
00:30:14,899 --> 00:30:20,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have actually done auto approval on</font>

707
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,460
their end points already so I think

708
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,200
things are getting better but I i

709
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:26,960
definitely understand and have seen the

710
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,399
situation that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

711
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:31,490
what yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I think basically</font>

712
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,110
there's sort of two two phases here the

713
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,630
first phases<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provisioning and the</font>

714
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:37,520
second phase is the experimentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

715
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:39,320
provisioning typically does take a long

716
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,240
time as you point it out but once it's

717
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:42,889
there the experimentation should be

718
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,690
pretty simple it should be you know it

719
00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:46,520
just works but the bootstrapping

720
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,200
problems there of getting connected if

721
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:51,830
you have a new site that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

722
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:55,130
plug into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Genie and the last question</font>

723
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:57,710
over this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike damn agree and Johns</font>

724
00:30:55,130 --> 00:31:00,529
Hopkins Applied Physics lab so you know

725
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:02,389
a lot of operators are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> skeptical</font>

726
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:03,799
about sdn we were having a very vigorous

727
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:06,620
discussion about this over lunch

728
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:08,990
yesterday a bunch of us um I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

729
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:11,779
get that genie you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know is</font>

730
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:14,360
an nsf-funded you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> testbed that's</font>

731
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:16,490
run by BBN and you know layered on

732
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:20,209
internet to dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs you know sure</font>

733
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:22,159
and you know but the what a lot of and

734
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,350
everybody understands the you know the

735
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,659
well-documented use cases of you know

736
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,459
building terascale data centers yep you

737
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:30,350
know having protein having strange

738
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,840
protocol research by your grad students

739
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:34,580
yep you know general test bed for doing

740
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,899
weirdness at layer 2 yep you know

741
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:38,899
everybody understands those things but

742
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:41,418
you know what what's really committing

743
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:44,149
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people's mind is compelling</font>

744
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:46,130
use cases and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

745
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:47,418
you had a slide in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there in which you</font>

746
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,940
glided over a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them without</font>

747
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:52,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">really you know going into them I get it</font>

748
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:55,179
as BBN you're the operators of the test

749
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:57,770
bed and it's not your experiments but

750
00:31:55,179 --> 00:32:00,049
but and also you had you had the

751
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,429
debugging stuff of like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

752
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:03,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">I debug something where the traffic</font>

753
00:32:01,429 --> 00:32:04,669
flows all go south but sure what<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

754
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,590
you trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do in the first place sure</font>

755
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:07,760
we all have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do bug problems right but</font>

756
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,949
what was it you were really<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

757
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,049
accomplish and that's where people

758
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:14,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">really get very skeptical</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean so you</font>

759
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:16,158
know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of tends to fall into the</font>

760
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:19,309
religious camps of people who are either

761
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,299
firm believers in DIY<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know and they</font>

762
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:22,250
really want to write everything

763
00:32:20,299 --> 00:32:23,510
themselves and they have operators

764
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:25,309
should have strong programming

765
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,889
experience la la all that kind of stuff

766
00:32:25,309 --> 00:32:29,690
and people who like you know and any

767
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:32,000
other issue is from a vendor perspective

768
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,669
you know Sdn is simply turning into an

769
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,809
API you know they're sort of saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

770
00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:37,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to rip the</font>

771
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:38,779
protocol head off<font color="#E5E5E5"> your switch and write</font>

772
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:41,299
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own stuff anymore like you used to</font>

773
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:42,630
with open flow these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know you</font>

774
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:44,910
can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your cake and eat it too</font>

775
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,740
you can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can run your standard switch</font>

776
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,060
our switches and you know do all the

777
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:49,560
standard stuff you're used to doing and

778
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,149
then if you feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like doing any of this</font>

779
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,669
extra programming well then that's just

780
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:57,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">an API to write so that's kind of where</font>

781
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:59,000
a lot of you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know vendors see sdn going</font>

782
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:04,110
to so I wonder<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you had any comments</font>

783
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:07,490
um all that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so I I think you're</font>

784
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:10,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">right about the applications development</font>

785
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:13,890
the kinds of things that I've seen that

786
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:16,379
aren't the most interesting on<font color="#E5E5E5"> geni for</font>

787
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,850
applications which you're right I didn't

788
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,170
cover in great detail here because it's

789
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:26,000
not our specialty are people at campuses

790
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:28,410
who were using sdn to find and capture

791
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,050
interesting things on laptops that they

792
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:33,810
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of be able to isolate and</font>

793
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:35,129
do something special with there are

794
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:38,550
other technologies that you could use

795
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:41,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that too but they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do it</font>

796
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,770
with sdn kind of easier and faster than

797
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:48,270
with three or four different special

798
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:49,860
purpose vendor tools and then I think

799
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:55,110
there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of interesting stuff</font>

800
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:56,760
happening with handing off Sdn between

801
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,800
different organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're just</font>

802
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:00,540
in the early phases of that so again

803
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,000
that's interesting from a network

804
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:04,590
person's point of view and it's

805
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,690
interesting to run an application that

806
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,279
you know has an endpoint Japan and an

807
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:11,280
endpoint in Europe and a few people in

808
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. participating but I wouldn't</font>

809
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,389
say there's a killer app there yet Tim

810
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:19,980
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I i agree i think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

811
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:24,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">cases where I've seen where it had value</font>

812
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,889
would be things closer to the edge where

813
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,199
it's not risky and maybe you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

814
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:30,540
something specialized or really just in

815
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,428
general special cases where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

816
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,469
do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's more standard I'm</font>

817
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to give the prototypical sdn</font>

818
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:37,469
example which is what Google does with

819
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:40,320
their backbone stuff you know they're

820
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:41,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing vgp but occasionally if they want</font>

821
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,159
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some traffic engineering stuff</font>

822
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,460
they can just toss that in and it's it's

823
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,440
easy for them to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess so it's I</font>

824
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">think at this stage it's more about</font>

825
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,810
looking for

826
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,270
are cases where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to augment what</font>

827
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:57,129
you have today and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is another</font>

828
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,990
bootstrapping problem where that code

829
00:34:57,129 --> 00:35:00,098
doesn't exist<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as an operator you</font>

830
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably don't want to go and write it</font>

831
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:04,660
yourself but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also don't think that I</font>

832
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:06,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that part of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is opening up an</font>

833
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,078
ecosystem such that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

834
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,240
incumbent vendors that can come in and

835
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">write that for you it could be it could</font>

836
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,750
be anybody and as long as you know

837
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,819
somebody's tried it and they say all

838
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,530
this is this is pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> then maybe</font>

839
00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:20,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">somebody else will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try it and if that</font>

840
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:23,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">gained some traction then then it kind</font>

841
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,290
of opens up the space to two other

842
00:35:23,069 --> 00:35:28,029
smaller vendors to give you some code

843
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,650
that you can run<font color="#E5E5E5"> yourself and as an</font>

844
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:31,810
operator you don't have to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and</font>

845
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,180
write it all from scratch so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind</font>

846
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:36,009
of my view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these yeah I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean this is</font>

847
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">a conference of operators right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

848
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally would have enjoyed</font>

instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of saying here's our testbed you</font>

851
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:45,490
know la la you know if you'd let off

852
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">with like okay here's a bunch of things</font>

853
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,430
that people have done on this test bed

854
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,660
that have actually found their way out

855
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:51,640
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world and aren't just of</font>

856
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,520
interest academics you know kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

857
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,900
thing but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a suggestion</font>

858
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,690
alright last question of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mics here</font>

859
00:35:55,900 --> 00:36:02,440
before we cut to the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation</font>

860
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:03,760
hi Paul kinetic epic technologies I just

861
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,190
have kind of one question playing off

862
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,260
the previous comment I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

863
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,810
your technology can be used by both

864
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,430
academics and third parties that

865
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:14,890
register my town recently just<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a</font>

866
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,980
genie racket in Flint Michigan my

867
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:20,078
question is do you provide services for

868
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,000
commercialization for third parties or

869
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,440
any assistant with any assistance with

870
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,500
commercialization of technologies

871
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,470
developed on your platform NSF is

872
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,200
explicitly supporting people who want to

873
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,790
do prototype transition to

874
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:36,279
commercialization on the genie network

875
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:38,710
they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a good thing they</font>

876
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,260
want people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have partners who who are</font>

877
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved with research it's not hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

878
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:46,270
find partners you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come to a genie</font>

879
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,160
conference you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually get support</font>

880
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:50,050
from NSF<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come to a genie conference</font>

881
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,060
and there are a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who would</font>

882
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:54,849
be interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with anybody</font>

883
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:56,380
who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try this out for any reason</font>

884
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:58,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's leading to a horrible</font>

885
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,910
commercialization

886
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:02,190
great I was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make the</font>

887
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">distinction on it this was purely in the</font>

888
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,660
academic realm or if they were allowed

889
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,570
you know no it's explicitly open to

890
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,339
other other people startups things like

891
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:14,570
that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to use the genie</font>

892
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network obviously to support an existing</font>

893
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:18,540
service that you're already paying for

894
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,340
and try to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in SF connections</font>

895
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:22,290
for free but you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> long as it's</font>

896
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:24,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">not something like that and you have a</font>

897
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:27,600
good case for engineering integration or

898
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:29,730
research then it's likely to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed</font>

899
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,560
on the genie network we use other

900
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,450
people's networks so we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

901
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure we don't violate their roles</font>

902
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,490
but the rules are pretty are pretty

903
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:42,810
tolerant and we intentionally did it

904
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:45,169
that way great thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

905
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:45,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's up</font>

906
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,380
you
