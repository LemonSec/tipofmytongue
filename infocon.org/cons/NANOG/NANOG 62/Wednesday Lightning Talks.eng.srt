00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">understanding of what remote trigger</font>

23
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,270
black hole is so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer</font>

24
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,850
typically with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer relationship with</font>

25
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:27,979
an upstream isp they signal the upstream

27
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,240
particular address or prefix and so that

28
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,550
traffic stops before it gets on to the

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,929
link of the customer and so that works

30
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,908
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's nice and that's been</font>

31
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:42,860
used for a very long time with great

32
00:01:37,909 --> 00:01:45,170
success<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should point out that this</font>

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,739
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario is a relationship</font>

34
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:51,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">between one will call the edge customer</font>

35
00:01:48,739 --> 00:01:53,989
and a cust and the customers upstream

36
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:57,348
ISP or some<font color="#CCCCCC"> hear of some sort and so</font>

37
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:59,780
there's a particular problem here or a

38
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:02,119
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in certain cases so</font>

39
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,399
while this works often and many<font color="#E5E5E5"> times if</font>

40
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,830
there's a particular sort of attack that

41
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,639
is overwhelming or so severe that

42
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,930
upstream ISP cannot deal with on its own

43
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:16,309
this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to necessarily do all</font>

44
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:17,959
that much good so this this leads us to

45
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,489
a conclusion that what we're missing is

46
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:21,160
something else that's that's bigger than

47
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:24,020
this something that's more coordinated

48
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,400
would be nice if it was automated and

49
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:31,760
something very quick to to deploy across

50
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,800
a wider range of autonomous systems so

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,660
too when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traditional approaches of a</font>

52
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,920
denial<font color="#E5E5E5"> service attack if you have</font>

53
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,329
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you cannot deal with</font>

54
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,920
yourself there's phone calls that are

55
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,319
involved mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists post to get other</font>

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,849
people involved to help out so that

57
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,829
takes a significant amount of time so

58
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,230
what can we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that a little bit</font>

59
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:49,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">better or perhaps we extend the idea of</font>

60
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,619
remote trigger black hole to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,750
community so we have a remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> trigger</font>

62
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,810
black hole sir

63
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,850
that many<font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS can then p or two and</font>

64
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,560
this isn't necessarily a new idea but

65
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,120
it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> project that we've we've somewhat</font>

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,340
attempted before and other people have

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,810
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a similar sort of thing but</font>

68
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,430
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have asked us about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

69
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,380
recently and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said okay we'll give</font>

70
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,600
it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> try we'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we get people to</font>

71
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,780
do this so we have this basically remote

72
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:16,150
trigger black hole server that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

73
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,540
peer with and it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting started</font>

74
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,730
so we have maybe 15 or 20 beers today

75
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:23,650
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that someone injects a</font>

76
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,170
prefix into this and it gets distributed

77
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,600
to all the others participants who then

78
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,089
block the traffic closer to that their

79
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,190
edge at least of the network and so if

80
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,010
there is enough networks participating

81
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:38,790
in this in theory you can you can block

82
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:43,750
a significant attack on a very

83
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,980
distributed basis so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

84
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,239
read all the bullet<font color="#E5E5E5"> points of this but</font>

85
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,220
I'll cover a few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can find</font>

86
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">this slide deck on Nana's web page you</font>

87
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,209
can search for me and team<font color="#CCCCCC"> cumbrian</font>

88
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,400
you'll find a more detailed fact about

89
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:57,400
all those sorts of stuff but today we're

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,280
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing ipv4 / 32 s route</font>

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:01,660
announcements we can do flow spec people

92
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,070
have asked us about that would it be

93
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,100
nice if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could do flow spectacle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

94
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that okay in fact we could do it we use</font>

95
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:11,230
software called<font color="#CCCCCC"> exa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp which supports</font>

96
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,390
flow spec we've actually tried flows

97
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Becky for and we literally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got no</font>

98
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,099
interest in people actually setting up

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,079
hearing sessions with flows back so

100
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,310
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we're not actually doing flow</font>

101
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,229
spec today but if enough people say

102
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,040
please please enable flow spec for these

103
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:28,090
kinds of routes then we'll turn on

104
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,610
here's what it looks like on our<font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

105
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,229
appearing config it looks like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper</font>

106
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,960
config there's nothing really<font color="#E5E5E5"> fancy</font>

107
00:04:32,229 --> 00:04:37,930
about this you the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'll point</font>

108
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,820
out towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end there's a block for</font>

109
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,200
static routes this is where the

110
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,510
announcements would go<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'd be a bunch</font>

111
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,099
of /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32 s in there potentially it's</font>

112
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,380
currently empty it will hopefully

113
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,760
usually be empty so that traditionally

114
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,680
though on a regular basis there won't be

115
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:57,159
that many attacks going on so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

116
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,640
normally<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a very limited list if not</font>

117
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,360
empty so this allows us to scale to

118
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,530
which is potentially nice if one of the

119
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,110
couple things i'll mention about the

120
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,669
properties

121
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,910
and I won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> read each bullet point here</font>

122
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:13,430
but we are requiring tctmd five for

123
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:16,430
sessions since this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-hop sorry</font>

124
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:22,370
Patrick<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we will be requiring that</font>

125
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:24,950
the the config on our site is

126
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,290
essentially flexible really<font color="#E5E5E5"> flexible</font>

127
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,670
except for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our peering address we can't</font>

128
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:30,140
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> use any old peering address but</font>

129
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,290
otherwise we can configure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the session</font>

130
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,430
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ras n we can change your SN</font>

131
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:36,470
we could do essentially whatever you

132
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,140
want although we'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use your your</font>

133
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,430
assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn but we can set community</font>

134
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:43,700
tags and all that sort of stuff it's

135
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:46,220
very easy for us to do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so we</font>

136
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">only announced / 30 tues ipv4 we're not</font>

137
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,940
doing v6 right now we could there's

138
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,250
nothing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> prevent us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from doing that</font>

139
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,469
but that hasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been asked of us to do</font>

140
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,980
yet so until the time comes with just

141
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:01,220
doing that it's currently a manual

142
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,990
process and this is the piece that may

143
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,890
change depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the reaction to this</font>

144
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:09,290
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> by all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you if this project is</font>

145
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,150
somewhat successful and if we get to the

146
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:13,430
point of a hundred people expressing

147
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,409
interest or peering with us this project

148
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,350
within 30 days<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say will claim this</font>

149
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:20,600
as a success we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop or</font>

150
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:24,170
extend the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Softworks XO</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp to do some</font>

151
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,400
automated things when we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> received</font>

152
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,170
an announcement then we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

153
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,260
pass it on so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> an out-of-band</font>

154
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:31,820
manual vetting process for that route so

155
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,860
right now it's if there's an attack

156
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,520
someone has to manually contact us via

157
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">email or phone call and we'll apply the</font>

158
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,520
route the only person who can apply or

159
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:46,460
submit a prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the originator of a</font>

160
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,960
block covering that / / 32 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I couldn't</font>

161
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a decision to say look I don't</font>

162
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">really like Google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today I'm going to</font>

163
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,500
just decide Google DNS is no good and

164
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,880
block 88 so I was 32 that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

165
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,650
the way the systems designed it's the

166
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,110
only people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed to inject</font>

167
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:01,940
routes to this or effectively the

168
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,290
victims and those who have a

169
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,840
relationship with us and we've added

170
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:10,210
them and they then tell us that they

171
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,210
have a prefix that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to announce</font>

172
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:16,340
when we get to the automated process the

173
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,380
current thinking is that and this is

174
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,440
open to discussion or if you have ideas

175
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,030
as well

176
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:27,060
simply look at the historicity of the

177
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:29,219
the route prefix itself for the the

178
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,990
route that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're announcing and if we</font>

179
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,210
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been originating this</font>

180
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:35,000
route for some period of time and code

181
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:37,020
hasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> been written yet but say 30 days</font>

182
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,550
and you're the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only one who's been</font>

183
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,219
originating this prefix well okay maybe

184
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,390
that's good enough and then we'll accept

185
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,620
that route if there's something that

186
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:45,930
looks a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little odd like if there's</font>

187
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:48,470
multiple origins maybe will flag it and

188
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,090
then it gets punted to a manual<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font>

189
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,610
so that's our current thing of how we

190
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,599
would do it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we don't think</font>

191
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,550
we want to go down the route of like

192
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,740
route servers and you know if there was

193
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,080
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki you know that might work of</font>

194
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:03,090
course but then it might not because

195
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,190
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the originator of this route</font>

196
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,760
so although if we pass it on with the

197
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,290
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS maybe that'll work so it</font>

198
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,370
remains to be seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly how this will</font>

199
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:13,770
be implemented but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it will</font>

200
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,510
probably be based off but route history

201
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,770
if you have anything specific to say

202
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,680
about how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work I'd certainly</font>

203
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,320
like to hear about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it'll also go out</font>

204
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,669
via<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an alerts and so forth we've</font>

205
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,010
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about maybe delaying the</font>

206
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,539
announcements or providing the ability

207
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,950
for someone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a delayed</font>

208
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,500
announcement so they're not initially

209
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:33,569
the first to get it you know they're

210
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,820
very cautious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about getting routes first</font>

211
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,020
and don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be caught between a</font>

212
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,590
rock and a hard place if something gets

213
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:43,530
messed up this all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you probably</font>

214
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,880
recognize this the RT<font color="#E5E5E5"> Road sugar black</font>

215
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:46,620
hole finished as an attack I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font>

216
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,090
all understand that there's not much we

217
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,120
can do about that that is the intent

218
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:52,590
it's a sacrificial lamb if if we don't

219
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,390
like this then something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow spec</font>

220
00:08:52,590 --> 00:09:00,390
maybe the approach that we ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

221
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:04,920
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 20</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

222
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:06,870
using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> now you you can only we're only</font>

223
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,910
allowing people to participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

224
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,010
project if you haven't assigned<font color="#CCCCCC"> ASM so</font>

225
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,329
some people have come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us with a block</font>

226
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,010
of addresses that have made me<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

227
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:15,780
swipe to them or they've been allocated

228
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,610
and if they are not participating in

229
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,069
routing we're just saying well but we

230
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,570
can't take you at this time you know

231
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe we could do something else in the</font>

232
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">future but only taking bgp speakers is</font>

233
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,520
effectively if we don't get a hundred

234
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:31,650
peers within about 30 or 60 days we're

235
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,910
just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cancel this project so i</font>

236
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:34,829
would like to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if even</font>

237
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,180
if you're not sure you would want to do

238
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,310
this but if you have any interest in

239
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,459
this could work you say maybe I'll run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

240
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:43,380
test lab do tell me and that will at

241
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,720
least keep us working on it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if but</font>

242
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you don't tell me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that too and tell</font>

243
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,450
me this is a stupid idea and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

244
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,030
ridiculous and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> never do this I</font>

245
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,040
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> take it some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me that I'd like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

246
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:55,829
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to waste</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

247
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,620
time on if no one's going to do it so

248
00:09:55,830 --> 00:10:00,210
there's I wouldn't disclose who's using

249
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,070
it today if you were participating you

250
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:03,270
would get to learn<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but as a</font>

251
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,250
smattering of people there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font>

252
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:06,750
networks some small hosting providers

253
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,630
and some educational institutions and

254
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,240
there's a couple of simply large eyes

255
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,040
peas or participating in this as well

256
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,220
and there's a couple who are interested

257
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,959
in very cautious understandably and

258
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:22,350
probably waiting to see what other

259
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,760
people do so I there will be certain

260
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,740
people who just won't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and we're</font>

261
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay with that we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expect all AS IS</font>

262
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,750
to participate in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but we'll see if</font>

263
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,710
we can get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to do it so</font>

264
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,450
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few things left to do there's</font>

265
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,600
some code to potentially right if we

266
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,220
continue this project the most important

267
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,050
thing for me is to take myself out of

268
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,820
this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> because if you send an</font>

269
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,040
email to our web form to sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

270
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:45,960
some processing all that stuff if you

271
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,150
want to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a route inject into this</font>

272
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,770
it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be me taking care of it and I need</font>

273
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:51,510
to come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that picture</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a 24</font>

274
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:54,060
by 7 knock and so they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing</font>

275
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that not me there's been some other</font>

276
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,780
ideas we have a internet exchange

277
00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,030
protection service and our bogan feed

278
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,280
and should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we put those routes in this</font>

279
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:04,170
so you can also run those routes along

280
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,819
with the service and we said okay well

281
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,030
maybe you could do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as well but all</font>

282
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,980
these things are on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drawing board</font>

283
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:13,500
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll let you look at this page and</font>

284
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pages on our website and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and i hope</font>

300
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:03,250
brief this is a introduction<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a topic</font>

301
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,589
that we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be discussing at</font>

302
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,870
friday and more length so think of this

303
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:10,329
as the teaser I just want you folks to

304
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,560
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going on you might be</font>

305
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:15,819
interested you might not be interested

306
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,979
frankly but it's definitely a pretty

307
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,670
significant change that's an importance

308
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:24,399
of the community it's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ayana so</font>

309
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:26,979
what we're facing now is we're facing

310
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,230
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that the I Anna the internet</font>

311
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,050
assigned numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> Authority the</font>

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:41,470
parameter numbers throughout the history

315
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:45,310
of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> is undergoing a change</font>

316
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,410
and basically presently the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono</font>

317
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:48,880
operates under two different documents

318
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,399
one is a contract with the US government

319
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that contract is the IANA functions</font>

320
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:59,290
contract it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> provided for in with ntia</font>

323
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:06,490

324
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,980
can to provide these iono registry

325
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,589
services the registry services are

326
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:14,110
keeping track of a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of</font>

327
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:16,209
tables that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use in real</font>

328
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:19,690

329
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:23,260
coordination so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example the DNS root</font>

330
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:27,339
zone is one of those tables the ipv4

332
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:34,810
are iono tables that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

335
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,890
a thousand IETF parameter tables so this

336
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:48,310
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything from bgp options to mime</font>

337
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,899
types to every time I new BG new I RFC

338
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,000
comes out it has an eye in a

339
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,649
consideration section these are the

340
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,089
people that maintain the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put</font>

00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:58,899
it on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a website make it</font>

343
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:03,829
this is a critical function because it

344
00:14:02,089 --> 00:14:06,319
census from stomping on each other it

345
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:08,540
makes sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that port 80 is</font>

00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:11,329
for one thing in port 25 is for

many years the IETF since 2000 has also

357
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:38,269
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract I actually say the IETF</font>

358
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,059
has had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> MoU a memorandum of</font>

understanding which calls for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iono</font>

360
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:46,850
to provide the ICANN team to provide

361
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:48,559
certain I Anna services as well people

362
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:50,389
read these documents and some people say

363
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,189
they overlap<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred percent some</font>

364
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,439
people say they overlap<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty five</font>

365
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:58,459
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they're both out there one</font>

366
00:14:54,439 --> 00:15:01,790
is RFC 2860 and one is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the i KN ntia</font>

367
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:03,349
website so the I Anna does its job an

368
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:07,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet coordination for all of us</font>

369
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,230
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these two relationships the</font>

00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,050
US<font color="#E5E5E5"> government earlier this year</font>

371
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,389
announced it wants to transition the

oversight of the IANA functions contract

373

from<font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA to the global</font>

organization but the global

377
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,139
multi-stakeholder community is not and

378
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:31,910
transitioning oversight is a very

379
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:34,129
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing when you issue a</font>

380
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:37,219
contract you own the contract and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

381
00:15:34,129 --> 00:15:40,040
put oversight mechanisms SLA escalation

382
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,709
things like that but a community is not

383
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,998
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy thing to do a contract so it was</font>

384
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,800
kind of hard trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what</font>

385
00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:48,110
the US government actually wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

386
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:50,079
have happen other<font color="#E5E5E5"> than the fact that it</font>

387
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:53,600
wasn't contracting for these services

388
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:56,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so what they basically said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA</font>

389
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,429
said they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support and enhance</font>

399
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:21,019
the US government said that they want to

400
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,660
be out of the game of being the one

401

providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this unique oversight now</font>

402
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,110
there's a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about having the US</font>

403
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:29,449
government they're fairly predictable in

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,680
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example i know i do not</font>

405
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:33,740
know of any<font color="#E5E5E5"> case where they've gotten</font>

406
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,739
involved in either an ietf protocol

parameter situation or an r ir IP

408
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,240
address situation where they've given I

409
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">in on contradictory guidance than what</font>

410
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,050
the community has come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with so in</font>

411
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:49,339
some ways they're a nice stabilizing

412
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:51,109
force if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> outside the US and you</font>

413
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:53,120
look at the US government you might say

414
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,290
well they're stabilizing but every now

415
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,500
and then they do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty</font>

416
00:16:54,290 --> 00:17:01,939
surreal they decide unilaterally to take

417
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,280
action and so globally this stabilizing

418
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,990
influence isn't as popular as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

419
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">be from people within the US and that's</font>

420
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,660
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the drivers behind this</font>

421
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,150
the US government also said we want a

422
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:16,610
proposal from the global community but

423
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,709
it can't be government<font color="#E5E5E5"> based we do not</font>

424

00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,620
to come together to come up with one

468
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:06,440

with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF and the i kin community to</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a lot of fun and we're going</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to just discuss it at the upcoming rir</font>

473
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,090
meetings effectively what we're trying

474
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,120
to do is figure out how to replace<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

475
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:23,720
function the function of contracting

476
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:26,000
that this that us<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntia does with a</font>

477
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,870
community-based function to provide the

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,760
same effective role<font color="#E5E5E5"> an effective</font>

479
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,800
oversight so we still have an iono

480
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:36,230
performing but instead of at answering

481
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:41,300
to you the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NTIA it answers</font>

482
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:42,320
quote all of us questions let's see one

483
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,780
of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to think about</font>

484
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,429
here is this is the most important

485
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,340
transition the Internet's ever going to

486
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:50,810
go through and it is the least important

487
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,720
transition the Internet's ever going to

488
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:56,620
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> through so from the least important</font>

489
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:59,870
perspective folks this doesn't matter

490
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,340
ietf<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rirs know if the I</font>

491
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,750
Anna does its job on a week-to-week

492
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:04,490
basis we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have great working</font>

493
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:07,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationships with the I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Anna team and</font>

494
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,250
there's already SLA reporting for

495
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:13,340
example both in the contract and in the

496
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:16,130
IETF process so the I eat the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICANN is</font>

497
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:18,500
very accountable and if anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to</font>

498
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:20,390
go wrong like they didn't update the<font color="#CCCCCC"> asn</font>

499
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,660
registry or they didn't update the dns

500
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:27,440
root zone the parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> that directly give</font>

501
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:30,110
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy the rirs I can and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF</font>

502
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,870
would quickly notice and be right on top

503
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:35,449
of making it happen so in that way it's

504
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">the least important transition really</font>

505
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:38,330
doesn't matter because the customers who

506
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:41,780
use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inr going to make sure this is</font>

507
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">fine now it's the most important</font>

508
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,170
transition because

509
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,689
right now the ability for the US

510
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:51,200
government contract for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gives it</font>

511
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:53,540
the ability not to contract if the IRS

512
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,940
were to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a ditch and collectively</font>

513
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,159
make a very bad decision contrary to the

514
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:00,530
community or<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the ietf were to do</font>

515
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,660
something similar or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can were to do</font>

516
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,620
something similar right now you would

517
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the US</font>

518
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">government and go this is all working</font>

519
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,879
fine except that and because of that

520
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:14,510
issue whatever that is do not renew the

521
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,080
contract with ayana until<font color="#CCCCCC"> parenthesis I</font>

522
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:20,450
can comma I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATF comma or rirs get their</font>

523
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,010
act together and begin behaving like

524
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,820
they're supposed to an accountable

525
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:28,580
manner to us a coincidence of changing

526
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:31,790
this function is you'll never have that

527
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,220
ability to go to a party outside the

528
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:37,220
system to complain that the system isn't

529
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,170
working so in that way this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

530
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,490
very important you want to make sure

531
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:43,460
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these entities are</font>

532
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:45,290
appropriately accountable to you before

533
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,330
we actually get to the point of getting

534
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:49,460
the US government out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the picture ok</font>

535
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:54,189
questions and I can take one if i read

536
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:55,940
this clock correctly go any questions

537
