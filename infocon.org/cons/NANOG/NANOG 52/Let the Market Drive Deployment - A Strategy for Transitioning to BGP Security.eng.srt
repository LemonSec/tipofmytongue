1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,140
so first of all I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to thank you guys</font>

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">again for having me here to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,680
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on BGP routing security as many</font>

4
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:13,000
of you know we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on this</font>

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,070
problem for about three or four years

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,110
and it's really important for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to get</font>

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,310
your feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our work to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

8
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,300
we're modeling the right things and

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,189
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually reaching out to the</font>

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who are really going to deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

11
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,750
these problems in practice<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this</font>

12
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:27,550
is joint work with my two co-authors

13
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,020
Philippa Gill and Michael<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shapira who</font>

14
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,890
are sitting right over here and what

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,729
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to talk to you today about</font>

16
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:35,559
is deployment scenarios for bgp security

17
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,209
so as Randy mentioned even if we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

18
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">pki deployed in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet we're not</font>

19
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,350
done there's still attacks on these

20
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,970
systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually if you were here at</font>

21
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,530
nanog last<font color="#E5E5E5"> June I actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gave</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

22
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,180
presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> on different attacks that</font>

23
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,220
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible with our pki and different</font>

24
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,269
versions of security protocols so that's

25
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">not what I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about today</font>

26
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">what I'm going to assume is we're</font>

27
00:00:50,589 --> 00:00:54,220
working towards path validation and what

28
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,199
kind of deployment scenarios and

29
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:58,710
incentives can we put together<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give</font>

30
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:01,420
ISPs reasons to deploy these protocols

31
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,430
so the focus is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on incentives and it's</font>

32
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,850
very easy to be pessimistic in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

33
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,020
this design space so if you were to hear

34
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:09,548
that you have to all of a sudden deploy

35
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,869
bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuck in your router's the first</font>

36
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:13,420
thing you might say is why should<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do</font>

37
00:01:10,869 --> 00:01:15,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">this there's no security benefits if I'm</font>

38
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,219
the first router to deploy bgp sec I

39
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:19,990
can't speak bgp sex to anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't</font>

40
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:21,369
get any benefit from the protocol so

41
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,109
there really needs to be a critical mass

42
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:25,719
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the protocol just like</font>

43
00:01:23,109 --> 00:01:27,399
with ipv4 before we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any value</font>

44
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:28,839
from the protocol so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

45
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:30,520
problem and the second problem you might

46
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,200
say is well I can't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any money off</font>

47
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,240
of this protocol so how can I justify

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,049
this to my CEO to my manager why should

49
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,399
I do this science fiction right so what

50
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:40,810
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in this work is say that</font>

51
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,310
actually things aren't as bad as you

52
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,590
think what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work is going to talk</font>

53
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,929
about is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you can use bgp security as</font>

54
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:48,640
a differentiated service to attract your

55
00:01:46,929 --> 00:01:50,710
customers away from your competitors and

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,539
towards your network so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is if</font>

57
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,490
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have some reason to deploy bgp sec</font>

58
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,200
in order to get more customers that will

59
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:57,880
sort of push deployment globally through

60
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,560
the internet and we may end up in a

61
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,499
world where we have actually most of the

62
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,759
internet running path validation so what

63
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:05,619
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this work is we want to</font>

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,199
design<font color="#E5E5E5"> an engineer the BGP sec</font>

65
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:09,669
deployment process by the way I'm saying

66
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,250
bgp sec because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm part of that group</font>

67
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:13,809
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> also this applies both to sob GP or</font>

68
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,640
any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of path validation you want it</font>

69
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,510
to do in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these systems so we want to</font>

70
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">design this deployment process to make a</font>

71
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,899
ESPYs have ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> earn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> money by</font>

72
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,609
deploying these protocols with the goal

73
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,140
of eventually arriving at a state where

74
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,810
most of the world is<font color="#E5E5E5"> running BGP</font>

75
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:27,828
security in some form so what I'm going

76
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,060
to do today is<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about</font>

77
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:30,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the guidelines and the</font>

78
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,090
evaluation we did in order to claim that

79
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:33,230
these are sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the right guidelines</font>

80
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:35,720
for how you should deploy a path

81
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:37,099
validation in these<font color="#CCCCCC"> systems and before i</font>

82
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,109
start i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just present this quick</font>

83
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:41,000
caveat this is this requires a lot of

84
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,260
modeling and simulation as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

85
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,269
imagine this process is extremely

86
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:46,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated so we couldn't capture every</font>

87
00:02:44,269 --> 00:02:47,659
possible detail what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm trying to do</font>

88
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,739
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the trends and</font>

89
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:50,750
important issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've uncovered</font>

90
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:52,400
we're not actually claiming that we can

91
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,159
predict how BGP sec deployment will

92
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,959
really go in reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what I'm</font>

93
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,690
going to do today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is talk about first</font>

94
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,180
just review how BGP works some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

95
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:03,920
attacks on BGP and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like rpki</font>

96
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:05,840
and pass validation can prevent these

97
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,309
attacks then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to present the</font>

98
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,709
main contribution of this work which is

99
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">our strategy for bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sec deployment so</font>

100
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:12,769
how should we actually go about

101
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,388
deploying these systems and then I'll

102
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,190
justify to you why we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the</font>

103
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:17,959
right approach the way we justify this

104
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:19,670
is by modeling the deployment process

105
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also running simulations on the</font>

106
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,518
deployment process so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to show</font>

107
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:24,470
you some of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> results on how we</font>

108
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:26,030
evaluated<font color="#E5E5E5"> our strategy and finally I'll</font>

109
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,000
conclude with some recommendations<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

110
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,790
how we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should evolve</font>

111
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's just review quickly how</font>

112
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:38,060
BGP works so we have here a prefix there

113
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:39,560
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and we have all these ISPs and a</font>

114
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,419
SS that would like to reach this prefix

115
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,859
so what's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is we have</font>

116
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">these two a esas they're both verizon</font>

117
00:03:42,859 --> 00:03:47,269
wireless a esas they're announcing the

118
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,918
path to this prefix this / 24 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

119
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,989
interested in and the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP works as</font>

120
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,000
we know it's a path vector protocol so

121
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:55,220
ejs will put its name<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the path okay</font>

122
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,290
so it's the two hot path to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the / 24</font>

123
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:58,760
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're interested in now level 3 is</font>

124
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,739
going to route to this prefix and then

125
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,239
announced his neighbor is<font color="#E5E5E5"> p1 and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> China</font>

126
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Telecom that this is how they reach the</font>

127
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,409
prefix and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the path is level 3</font>

128
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,060
verizon and 223<font color="#E5E5E5"> 894 okay so the reason I</font>

129
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,168
picked this particular arrangement of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

130
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:14,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">esas is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because something very</font>

131
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting happened on April 8 2010</font>

132
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,190
many of you might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of this</font>

133
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,930
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> China Telecom router or sometime to</font>

134
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,090
telecom router hijacked a bunch of

135
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,320
prefixes about 50,000 prefixes and

136
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,239
Phillip has actually done extensive

137
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,440
research into the empirical data we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

138
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,440
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this day so if you have questions</font>

139
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,410
on that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to her</font>

140
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,170
so we have this prefix was advertised by

141
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,030
china telecom and what happened from the

142
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,920
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> was vice p1 was it says look</font>

143
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,469
I have two paths I don't know where this

144
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,840
prefix really lives as we know it lives

145
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,180
here attached to this verizon<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s but I</font>

146
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,950
sp1 didn't know where it was so it looks

147
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,570
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> these two paths it compares them it</font>

148
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,010
says the<font color="#CCCCCC"> China Telecom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path is one hop</font>

149
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,080
lung which is shorter than three hops

150
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,610
long so awesome here's how I'm going to

151
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,169
route<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the traffic was</font>

152
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:57,360
diverted through to the wrong router and

153
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:59,520
it didn't reach the destination now if

154
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,900
you read the<font color="#CCCCCC"> runs this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> blog they also</font>

155
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,549
round some trace routes and found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

156
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,870
some of this traffic was intercepted so

157
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,670
what really happened here was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there</font>

158
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,830
was a router that knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real route to</font>

159
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:09,420
the prefix we're talking about here and

160
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,859
it was routing this way and what

161
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,630
happened was the traffic went from this

162
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,100
faulty router through to the router that

163
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,950
knew where the prefix was and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

164
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,000
intercepted by<font color="#E5E5E5"> china telecom network so</font>

165
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,200
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the type of attack that we</font>

166
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,290
really want to prevent and this is why

167
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,050
we need path validation so just going to

168
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,240
quickly review what bgp sec does so bgp

169
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,500
sec uses cryptographic signatures and

170
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,110
what would happen now is when you make

171
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,250
your bgp sec announced mint you're going

172
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,510
to authorize you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce</font>

173
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,520
your path and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to forward</font>

174
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:37,740
sign like randy said so this proof this

175
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">is authorizes verizon wireless to</font>

176
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,600
announce this path and now as people

177
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,369
continue announcing their their paths

178
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,040
each person<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to sign their path</font>

179
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:48,840
so level<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 is forward signing to is p1</font>

180
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the path that it's using to the prefix a</font>

181
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,039
verizon is forward signing to level 3

182
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> path that it's using and so on so</font>

183
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,520
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have all three public</font>

184
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,410
keys which you should have because the

185
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">rpki store stores these public keys</font>

186
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:01,140
you're going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to validate that</font>

187
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,520
this announcement was made by the three

188
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,340
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> esas on the path and you know where</font>

189
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,870
the prefix really was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

190
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,909
showing you here a perfect world all of

191
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,590
these a esas are secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this is</font>

192
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,580
where we want to be but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not where</font>

193
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to be immediately we're</font>

194
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,479
going to live<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a world of partial</font>

195
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,950
deployment for a long time so let's

196
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">imagine a possible partial deployment</font>

197
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,120
scenario let's assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> China Telecom</font>

198
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,250
hasn't upgraded to bgp sec yet<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>

199
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,260
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> has okay and what happens if there</font>

200
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,400
was a really malicious router here okay

201
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,050
so this is what our router is going to

202
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,539
do it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to announce the same</font>

203
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,910
prefix that's owned owned by this is

204
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,680
right here but instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of claiming to</font>

205
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,090
own the prefix itself so doing a one hop

206
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,919
attack it's going to be claimed it's

207
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,719
going to lie and<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it's claimed that</font>

208
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,140
it's attached directly to the say yes

209
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so now what should I sp1 do well</font>

210
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:47,039
it should check the rpki to see what the

211
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:49,380
valid origin for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this prefixes and of</font>

212
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,360
course it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2239 for which is great so</font>

213
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,060
this announcement is valid and then it

214
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,830
says<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay which path is shorter china</font>

215
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">telecom awesome i'm going to route to</font>

216
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,810
China Telecom okay so what's wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

217
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happened here is</font>

218
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:04,979
that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> P is not incorporating the</font>

219
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:07,050
security preferences into its BGP

220
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,430
routing policy okay so one really

221
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:10,440
important point<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to make and</font>

222
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,000
we talked about bgp sec deployment it's

223
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">not enough just to sign and validate</font>

224
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,820
it's not enough just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade your</font>

225
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,380
router's with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cryptos crypto</font>

226
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,520
signatures and validations you actually

227
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to use this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information for</font>

228
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,880
something so there must be some

229
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,280
influence of the signatures or the

230
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,070
security state on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP decision</font>

231
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,530
process so if you're a security geek

232
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,669
like I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> and my call co-authors are you</font>

233
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:32,039
would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing you should do</font>

234
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:33,450
in your bgp sec in your bgp decision

235
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,400
process is check that the route is

236
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:37,140
secure if it's secure it should be

237
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,669
preferred all over all other routes that

238
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,890
are unsigned or invalid or whatever

239
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:43,650
prefer those first and then do your

240
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,630
local policies local prev AAS pass med

241
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,969
whatever you want ok this would be nice

242
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,380
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think you guys are all going</font>

243
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to immediately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be comfortable with doing</font>

244
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,770
this right because this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to</font>

245
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,270
really impact how routing might might go

246
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:56,070
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your networks so what we're going to</font>

247
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,479
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this deployment scenario that</font>

248
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to show is that you're not</font>

249
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,140
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put security over local pref</font>

250
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,849
or a s path you're going to put it after

251
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,800
local preference paths this is the

252
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,450
second last stage in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your decision</font>

253
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and this is we made this</font>

254
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:12,060
assumption so that we wouldn't have to

255
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,680
over over makeover assumptions that we

256
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,479
think that operators would be willing to

257
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,680
put security first but we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

258
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,719
assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's somehow somewhere in</font>

259
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,820
the decision process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

260
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> this assumption is that secure ISPs</font>

261
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,960
should at the very least break ties so

262
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,979
at the second last state in favor of

263
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,000
secure routes ok so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've gone</font>

264
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,370
over some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> background in the</font>

265
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,049
attacks um I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show our strategy</font>

266
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,520
for bgp deployment but before<font color="#CCCCCC"> i do that</font>

267
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:36,929
let's switch gears<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk a little bit</font>

268
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,490
about economics because this is really

269
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:39,718
an economic problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

270
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's going to affect</font>

271
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,800
the way deployment goes so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to</font>

272
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">present a very simple model of a s level</font>

273
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">business relationships sure almost all</font>

274
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,290
of you have seen this before so one

275
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,849
relationship that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> SS can have is</font>

276
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,349

277
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,180
pays the provider both<font color="#CCCCCC"> descendent to</font>

278
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,190
receive<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I show this with an</font>

279
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,239
you can see there's an arrow that means

280
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the money is traveling from the</font>

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,180
business relationship we could have is a

283
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,980
peer-to-peer a business relationship so

284
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,540
we have to a esas that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> having a</font>

285
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,010
settlement free peering agreement so for

286
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,740
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> two tier ones who no one pays</font>

287
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,060
each other for service or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

288
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,339
that google has a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

289
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,229
relationships with its neighbors so no

290
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:17,370
money travels on these<font color="#E5E5E5"> links okay so</font>

291
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,070
this is sort of where the money is

292
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,690
flowing in these systems<font color="#E5E5E5"> and another</font>

293
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,250
important point that we have to make is

294
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there's different kinds of a esas</font>

295
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,300
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet some a esas act as n</font>

296
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,279
sites some a esas provide transit so

297
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,930
what a stub is as randy said it's an AS

298
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,700
that has no customers of its own it

299
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,319
never does<font color="#E5E5E5"> transit right so for example</font>

300
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,480
this should never happen this guy's a

301
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,010
stub he's got two providers he shouldn't

302
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">be carrying traffic from one provider to</font>

303
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">the other because that means he's got to</font>

304
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,000
pay both of them for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the privilege of</font>

305
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,459
doing this<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what we're going to</font>

306
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,740
assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that stub guesses are</font>

307
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:48,959
basically origins or destinations for

308
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,130
traffic but they don't do transit now

309
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is really important because</font>

310
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">eighty-five percent of a esas in the</font>

311
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,829
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s graph are stubs okay so we</font>

312
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,360
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ignore these guys when we</font>

313
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:58,770
think about BGP sec deployment it's

314
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,000
really important to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

315
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,850
going to do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys because they</font>

316
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,010
make up so much of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

317
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,300
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> point is that ISPs make money</font>

318
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,610
by providing transit to their customers

319
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,290
right so that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

320
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,940
another thing that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use in</font>

321
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,680
our in our analysis is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going</font>

322
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to assume that when an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP attracts more</font>

323
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,939
customer traffic it earns more money

324
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:19,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the main source of revenue for isps</font>

325
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,029
or at least one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the major sources is</font>

326
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,130
getting traffic getting money from their

327
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:25,650
customers so the more customers in a s

328
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,760
can attract the happier they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

329
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,790
that's what we're going to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

330
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:31,800
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work so how can we use these two</font>

331
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,959
ideas that secure ISPs break ties in

332
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,000
favor of secure paths and also that ISPs

333
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,979
can attract more money by getting more

334
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,350
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let's look at this</font>

335
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,790
example here i'm showing here<font color="#CCCCCC"> sprint is</font>

336
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,079
trying to reach this destination which

337
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,209
is the stub we look talked about before

338
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:46,670
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's got two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paths both of them are</font>

339
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:48,839
equally long so they're two hops long

340
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,699
both of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are through peers so</font>

341
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,380
they're basically of equal cost so which

342
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,700
path should he choose so we're going to

343
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">assume he runs some kind of tie break</font>

344
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:57,779
algorithm and the tiebreak is in favor

345
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,920
of eight three five nine<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so now</font>

346
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,140
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the world where everyone is</font>

347
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,390
insecure all these a esas are purple ok

348
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,800
now let's imagine a partial deployment

349
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:06,300
scenario actually before I do that I

350
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,040
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say that this is if we look at</font>

351
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,500
him he's carrying traffic

352
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,089
sprint to his customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that means</font>

353
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that he's delivering a larger volume of</font>

354
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,420
traffic to his customer that means his

355
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:17,310
customers should be paying him more<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

356
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,660
so in this case this guy is happy

357
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,660
because he's delivering more customer

358
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,310
traffic to his customers so now let's

359
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:25,380
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a partial deployment scenario</font>

360
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,829
where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 3 s's that are secure so</font>

361
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,870
sprint 13 7 8 9 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 608 these three</font>

362
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:33,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys are secure and we have eight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font>

363
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">five nine insecure okay so now what's</font>

364
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,690
going to happen is there's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

365
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,889
two paths that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned here and by</font>

366
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:40,170
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way to the last question that was</font>

367
00:11:37,889 --> 00:11:42,240
asked to Randy this a s is insecure so

368
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,769
even though<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one is secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

369
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,899
announcement coming here is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a plain</font>

370
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,250
bgp announcement not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP sec announced</font>

371
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">Minh right so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what we mean when</font>

372
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,079
we say secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Islands this is a secure</font>

373
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,699
path this guy is a secure path because

374
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,500
all the a esas are secure this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

375
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:58,199
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have one insecure a s on the</font>

376
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,730
past okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sprint is learning to</font>

377
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:01,170
announcements one of them is secure and

378
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:03,029
one of them is insecure and like i said

379
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,069
before they're equally long both through

380
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:07,019
peers and show it should has to do a

381
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:08,310
tie-break okay so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're gonna</font>

382
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:10,050
assume is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the tiber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes in</font>

383
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">favor of secure paths and the traffic is</font>

384
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through 13 seven eight nine</font>

385
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,290
so now what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens is we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

386
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this insecure a s in the old world</font>

387
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:19,680
when everyone was insecure he was

388
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,268
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting as much more traffic than this</font>

389
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,489
guy he<font color="#E5E5E5"> was serving traffic from sprint</font>

390
00:12:21,269 --> 00:12:25,649
to his customer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new world where</font>

391
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:27,269
this guy's become secure 835 now and

392
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,980
nine is no longer delivering as much

393
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:31,380
traffic to his customer and so he's

394
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,420
losing money<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the idea that we're</font>

395
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,430
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use here is that an ISP that's</font>

396
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,839
insecure is going to be losing<font color="#E5E5E5"> customer</font>

397
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:38,370
traffic to its<font color="#E5E5E5"> competitors and that's</font>

398
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,079
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create reasons for it to feel</font>

399
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">like it's falling behind it better</font>

400
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,489
deploy secure routing or it's going to

401
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,899
lose a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of its customers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and this is</font>

402
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,209
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we believe will drive to</font>

403
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,740
the deployment process so now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

404
00:12:48,209 --> 00:12:51,060
really this is really what we're

405
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,199
proposing here this is the three

406
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,939
guidelines that we're going to propose

407
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,839
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP sec deployment the first one</font>

408
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the one I've been talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

409
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">before us the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is peas to the very</font>

410
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,110
minimum break ties in favor of secure

411
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,000
paths if your ISP feels like it wants to

412
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,579
rank security first above local press

413
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,019
awesome our results will still hold but

414
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,370
we're suing at the very very minimum

415
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,230
you're going to assume that security

416
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,459
matters right before<font color="#CCCCCC"> tie breaks ok so</font>

417
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:13,410
this is the first assumption we're going

418
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,579
to make the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we're going to</font>

419
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,130
say is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there should be a bunch of</font>

420
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:19,050
early adopter ISPs so when we ran out of

421
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,350
simulations we did extensive studies to

422
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,510
try to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out who should the early</font>

423
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,160
doctors be these Ras is that either the

424
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">government has created regulation saying</font>

425
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,310
that they have to be secure so for

426
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,750
example they may be military providers

427
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,189
or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this these may be</font>

428
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">essence with a special interest in</font>

429
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,060
security they may be altruistic but we

430
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this initial set of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> esas that's</font>

431
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,300
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> become secure and what our</font>

432
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,190
simulations show is about five of the

433
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:43,209
biggest tier ones is what we need plus

434
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:44,800
or minus five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten a esas okay and the</font>

435
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,150
final<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which is really important is</font>

436
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,280
we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're going to</font>

437
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:49,660
deal with stub a esas so what we're

438
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:51,310
going to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as soon as an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> isp</font>

439
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,290
becomes secure so for example this guy

440
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,180
became secure what he's going to do is

441
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,400
he's going to secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> his stub customers</font>

442
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:59,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so when you when you turn on your</font>

443
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">isp the next thing you're going to do is</font>

444
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,280
go to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your stub customers and</font>

445
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,300
start upgrading them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp sec okay now</font>

446
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,890
the reason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think this is</font>

447
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,680
legitimate is what Randy talked about

448
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,360
with the secure end site right so a stub

449
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,979
is an AS that only originates its own

450
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,690
prefix it doesn't do transit for other

451
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,280
asses so it's enough from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

452
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,630
perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the global internet for</font>

453
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,610
these guys to sign for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

454
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,860
prefixes and trust their providers to

455
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:22,600
validate for them as randy said this

456
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,460
doesn't require a hardware upgrade and

457
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,080
the security impact is quite low so we

458
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">analyze a security impact I'm not going</font>

459
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about that right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now but if you</font>

460
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,579
have questions I can answer them

461
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,590
afterwards so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of a cheap</font>

462
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:36,160
way to get as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many stubs to become</font>

463
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:37,630
secure as quickly as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

464
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,490
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> place where we really see government</font>

465
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,320
incentives is being useful if we turn on

466
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ISPs they should be subsidized to</font>

467
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,050
turn on their customers because this is

468
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,000
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going to push forward all</font>

469
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,770
of the deployment and again like I said

470
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,700
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important because so much</font>

471
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,470
of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stubbs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so I've</font>

472
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,360
presented now the strategy that's really

473
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:57,160
what we're proposing for the way the BGP

474
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,920
sex should be deployed or any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

475
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,870
pass validation protocol how can I claim

476
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this makes sense so what I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

477
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:05,920
to do is present a model we came up with

478
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,570
for the deployment process and show you

479
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,939
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> simulation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> resolve the rear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and on</font>

480
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,490
the UCLA kikes wops data this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a map</font>

481
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,800
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interdomain AS level</font>

482
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,750
relationships we simulated this process

483
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,890
on it and we can use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that</font>

484
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">our strategy makes sense so let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me start</font>

485
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">by presenting the model so our model is</font>

486
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,790
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple okay we start with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

487
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,650
graph everybody is insecure the early

488
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,880
adopters<font color="#E5E5E5"> become secure so the five tier</font>

489
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:32,350
ones we decided should be early adopters

490
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,320
they become secure

491
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,150
and their stub customers become secure

492
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,100
the next thing we do we go in rounds we

493
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:41,770
look at all the insecure ISPs in the

494
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,870
network we say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was to become secure</font>

495
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,520
how much more traffic would I get if I

496
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:47,650
get more than theta percent more traffic

497
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,420
than I'm becoming secure and if not I

498
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,800
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compute how much</font>

499
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,810
more traffic they would get by becoming

500
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,339
secure so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you see a five</font>

501
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,689
percent increase by becoming secure

502
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,460
you're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> upgrade your network and</font>

503
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,870
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course when you upgrade your network</font>

504
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:02,950
you're also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade your stubs</font>

505
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,480
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay to simplex bgp and we</font>

506
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,580
continue this process until no new

507
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,680
secure ISPs want to become secure and

508
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:10,690
that's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so this is</font>

509
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">just so just to say that each round in</font>

510
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:14,530
the simulation could take multiple years

511
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,850
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't immediately expect eyes peas to</font>

512
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:17,350
upgrade their<font color="#CCCCCC"> stubbs the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second they</font>

513
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,700
become secure but we sort of mush this

514
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:22,510
all together so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can run effective</font>

515
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,860
simulations on us okay so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

516
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,689
thing I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> before I finish</font>

517
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,970
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we compute customer traffic</font>

518
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,830
volume so we do a very simple

519
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,690
computation what we say is if you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

520
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,940
destination that you're reaching on a

521
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,920
customer edge then just count the number

522
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,330
of ISPs a<font color="#E5E5E5"> esas that are routing through</font>

523
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,040
you and that's the amount of traffic

524
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,150
you're delivering to this<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer okay</font>

525
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we just do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all possible</font>

526
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:43,990
customer destinations so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

527
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,830
determine routing in this network so

528
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,510
what we're going to do is we're going to

529
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,670
use a standard model of BGP routing

530
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,010
policies and simulate how traffic flows

531
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:53,319
on these<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS graphs that we got from UCLA</font>

532
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cyclops ok so the routing policies we</font>

533
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:58,270
model is just local pref<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS path prefer</font>

534
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,040
security and then the arbitrary

535
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">tie-break our model of local puff is</font>

536
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:04,960
just customers better than<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer is</font>

537
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:07,690
better than provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's our</font>

538
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:10,090
model and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show you some</font>

539
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,920
simulation results so we ran multiple

540
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:14,199
simulations each one of our simulations

541
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,730
took a day to half a day to run we ran

542
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,770
them on 200 machines I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

543
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:19,630
tell you one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the simulations that we</font>

544
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:22,030
ran what we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> was we pick 10 early</font>

545
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:23,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">adopters 5 of the biggest dear ones this</font>

546
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:26,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the biggest according to the graph we</font>

547
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,750
had so sprint verizon AT&T level<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 and</font>

548
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,430
cogent and we picked five large content

549
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,680
providers Microsoft Google Facebook

550
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,090
Akamai and limelight so we assume these

551
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,010
guys become secure at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of</font>

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we run the simulation</font>

553
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:40,960
and see how many a esas end up secure at

554
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,610
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the process so what did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

555
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,350
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found at the end of the process</font>

556

eighty-five percent of a esas in our

557

and you may be wondering how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of</font>

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,630
percent of the ISPs in our graph become

562
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,760
secure so it really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is showing an</font>

563
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:59,500
effective deployment so in case you've

564
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,629
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> lost in all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details the strategy</font>

565
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:07,240
works ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> and now let me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you why it</font>

566
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:09,130
works<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so so here let's start with it</font>

567
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,600
with an example we have our early

568
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,550
adopters so remember I said sprint with

569
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,530
one of our early adopters it's secure

570
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,720
nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else is secure and the way</font>

571
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,660
traffic is going to this stub here 18

572
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:23,410
608 is through eight three five nine ok

573
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:25,810
so at round 1 13 7 8 9 says<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let me</font>

574
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:27,760
become secure if I become secure my stub

575
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:29,200
become secure and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic is going</font>

576
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to shift through me and I'm happier</font>

577
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,640
because I'm delivering more traffic to

578
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,310
my stub ok that was round one some stuff

579
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,560
happens in round 4 8<font color="#E5E5E5"> 359 says wait a</font>

580
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,030
minute I've lost my traffic if I become

581
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,980
secure I'm going to get at least five

582
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,600
percent increase in customer traffic and

583
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,250
so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to turn on and I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

584
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,379
get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the stub through</font>

585
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,640
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and just to mention that i'm</font>

586
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,680
showing here just for one particular

587
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,840
customer destination the stub that i'm

588
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,400
showing 18 608 we ran this for all

589
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,959
possible destinations but since there's

590
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,370
36 thousand of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can't show them to</font>

591
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,980
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the slide ok so this is just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

592
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:01,479
of them so now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight 359 became</font>

593
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,250
secure we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually can look at even</font>

594
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer secure path so for example at</font>

595
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:09,130
round for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traffic for this stub 50</font>

596
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:12,040
197 goes on this path what happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

597
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:14,110
round<font color="#E5E5E5"> five is 6731 says if I become</font>

598
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,580
secure and my stub becomes secure the

599
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,040
traffic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to shift and go through</font>

600
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,659
me ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what's happening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

601
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:21,430
lot of competition for these<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home</font>

602
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,290
stuffed and this process will continue

603
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:26,140
we can look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> even longer paths we have</font>

604
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:28,120
this of longer path here what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

605
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen at around seven is that one for</font>

606
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,780
209 is going to say if I become secure

607
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,100
and my stub becomes secure then the

608
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,870
traffic will shift through me and I'm

609
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to earn more money ok and this is</font>

610
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,870
really what we see is driving the

611
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,610
deployment process and all it all we

612
00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:41,500
need for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a SS to break ties</font>

613
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,240
on secure paths<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok we didn't have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

614
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,080
assume any other assumptions on where

615
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,430
security goes in the BGP hierarchy so

616
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,370
one really important question is who

617
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:53,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">stirred the early adopters be um if you</font>

618
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,020
read our paper if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go to or if you</font>

619
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:57,280
read if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our written material</font>

620
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,900
on this stuff we've done extensive

621
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,299
simulations trying many different kinds

622
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,919
of real

623
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:02,809
adopters<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to present too</font>

624
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,340
many of the details but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what</font>

625
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:05,809
we found is that tier ones are extremely

626
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,730
important the reason for<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is they</font>

627
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:09,830
have many<font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home stubs connected to</font>

628
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,239
them content providers are important

629
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">even though they provide a large volumes</font>

630
00:20:11,239 --> 00:20:14,299
traffic they don't have as many

631
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:15,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home stubs associated with them</font>

632
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:17,600
and so they don't create as much path

633
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:19,488
diversity as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ax tier ones would do</font>

634
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,809
initially so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> really seeing is</font>

635
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:22,429
the tier ones are the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font>

636
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:23,840
initial early adopters here and the

637
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,730
content providers can help a lot as well

638
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,570
and i have lots more details<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this so</font>

639
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">please ask me if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have questions</font>

640
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:32,418
about this so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap up</font>

641
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:34,190
so we have time for<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions the first</font>

642
00:20:32,419 --> 00:20:36,470
really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> point that we feel from</font>

643
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,509
this from this space is that secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

644
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,489
or BGP sec in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> improve security</font>

645
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:41,840
it has to impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> route selection and</font>

646
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,879
therefore it's going to impact traffic

647
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,350
engineering now you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is a</font>

648
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:46,759
bad thing this can also be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

649
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,619
the way we can think about this is

650
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:49,669
impact on traffic engineering gives you

651
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,769
an opportunity to offer it

652
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:52,999
differentiated service taking customers

653
00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">away from your competitors and</font>

654
00:20:52,999 --> 00:20:57,230
potentially having security deployments

655
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,850
pay for themselves at your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP because</font>

656
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,379
you've increased<font color="#E5E5E5"> you receive such an</font>

657
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:01,908
increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> in customer revenue that</font>

658
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:03,498
actually may pay for the router upgrades

659
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:05,929
and that's what we see as driving this

660
00:21:03,499 --> 00:21:07,220
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> process the main reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did</font>

661
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:09,169
this work was we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide some</font>

662
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:10,999
guidance to regulators and governments

663
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:12,859
on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsidize this process where</font>

664
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:14,509
to put the money in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process one of</font>

665
00:21:12,859 --> 00:21:16,220
the most important and obvious places is

666
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:17,210
to pay off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early adopters</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to adopt</font>

667
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:18,799
the protocol because at the beginning

668
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,970
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really getting much benefit</font>

669
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,408
from the protocol they're sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of doing</font>

670
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">this to kick off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the process and get</font>

671
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:26,059
things going the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next really important</font>

672
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">point that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we think is that ISPs need to</font>

673
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:29,600
be active participants in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this process</font>

674
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:31,129
when they upgrade themselves it's really

675
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,869
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to upgrade their customers as</font>

676
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:34,908
well this is another place we see

677
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:36,889
government incentives playing a role and

678
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:38,210
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really important to consider this</font>

679
00:21:36,889 --> 00:21:39,619
because so much of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

680
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:41,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Stubbs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are creating the path</font>

681
00:21:39,619 --> 00:21:44,779
diversity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the competition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

682
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,340
traffic so just to reiterate our work is

683
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:47,529
not predictive but we do hope that we've

684
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:50,539
captured some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the key issues</font>

685
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:51,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">affecting deployment I've left a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

the details out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk because I</font>

687
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:55,220
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> much time I encourage you to</font>

688
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:57,559
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our website here this has a</font>

secure when and with what increase in

695
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:08,359
customer traffic so we have full

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:24,429
that I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chance to talk about</font>

701
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:24,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you five minutes for question</font>

702
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:36,350
Tom Daley from<font color="#E5E5E5"> dining great work Sharon</font>

703
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:38,809
thank you for the presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

704
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:41,988
appreciated it did you happen to model

705
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:45,739
at one at the point where most of your

706
00:22:41,989 --> 00:22:48,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">ASNs become secure does the original</font>

707
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:51,259
traffic pattern shift back in any way

708
00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:53,600
and so essentially as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP do you</font>

709
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:55,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">receive a one-time lift of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> revenue and</font>

710
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,070
then eventually that goes away<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I have</font>

711
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:59,359
a slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> just for you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so we have to</font>

712
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,769
cut this because we didn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> time so</font>

713
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:01,970
what I'm going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show you now is these</font>

714
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:03,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three I skis that we saw the</font>

715
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:05,330
traffic jumping around from them before

716
00:23:03,379 --> 00:23:07,820
we want to see their increases in

717
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,739
traffic volume over time so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

718
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,320
simulation that I showed before what's

719
00:23:09,739 --> 00:23:14,210
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is this guy the red he</font>

720
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,220
became secure first at Round four and

721
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:18,200
then the green became secure right after

722
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,849
to steal a traffic back so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see</font>

723
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,769
what happened is as time goes by there

724
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:22,849
there traffic volume drops because

725
00:23:21,769 --> 00:23:24,859
they're losing traffic to their

726
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:26,090
competitors and then it shoots up right

727
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:27,710
so there's this period of time where it

728
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:29,658
shoots up and then it sort of goes back

729
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> normal so the reason it's going back</font>

730
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,840
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> normal here is because most of the</font>

731
00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:33,979
Internet has<font color="#E5E5E5"> become secure and so</font>

732
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,439
there's really not as much competition

733
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:39,309
for this guy to win but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point that's</font>

734
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:42,349
important here is if we look at him he's

735
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:44,178
blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so let's look at blue he never</font>

736
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:46,340
became secure so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened to him is</font>

737
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,749
his traffic volume sort of tapers off<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

738
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:49,158
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason he never became secure as it</font>

739
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:50,690
sort of tapered off to around<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

740
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:52,070
percent loss and we required a five

741
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,869
percent threshold so he never<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned on</font>

742
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,668
so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line is the</font>

743
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:57,139
security at your traffic volume will go

744
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:58,940
up for a while and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go back</font>

745
00:23:57,139 --> 00:24:00,529
but the nice thing about when it goes

746
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,869
back is most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is secure</font>

747
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:10,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok so that's how we see this guy thank</font>

748
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:13,519
you Tony capella 95 s data and I like

749
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:15,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the presentation thank you I do have a</font>

750
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,269
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about perhaps secondary</font>

751
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:19,609
benefits if there's any potential for

752
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:21,049
you to simulate or consider this as

753
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:23,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet scales and grows of course</font>

754
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,249
people try to filter things today with

755
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:27,349
essentially flat lists prefix filters

756
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:28,609
and so forth on edges and as various

757
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,749
means of course to build them and

758
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:33,470
automate them and try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make them</font>

759
00:24:29,749 --> 00:24:34,970
accurate after this stuff kind of evens

760
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,369
out again it seems like we want to have

761
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,139
something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about which could</font>

762
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:40,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest that be ought to continue to</font>

763
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:44,748
do it and make it scale better make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

764
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,240
more more beneficial to mother secondary

765
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:48,630
way

766
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,730
so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example is there any benefit to</font>

767
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,990
saying to an operator or could you

768
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,330
characterize<font color="#E5E5E5"> to an operator an</font>

769
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:56,820
additional improvement in operational

770
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,340
efficiencies because now<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're perhaps</font>

771
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:01,139
less interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in or don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

772
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:04,110
worry about some aspects that they were

773
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,480
prior used to concerned with is is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

774
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,120
at all tangential here we haven't

775
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">covered that in this work so I guess one</font>

776
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,479
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might look at is how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

777
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,680
security might interact with some<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff</font>

778
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">like prefix filtering is that what</font>

779
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,500
you're a stalking about for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

780
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,120
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about in last year's</font>

781
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,450
nano talk now not talk with Michael

782
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shapira we analyzed how s PGP works in</font>

783
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:24,690
the presence of prefix filtering we

784
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:26,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually found that they this is not in</font>

785
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,900
this work at all but last<font color="#E5E5E5"> year</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

786
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,630
look at my nano talk from last year what

787
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,820
we found is that secure routing and pass

788
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,550
validation prevents one kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attack</font>

789
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,020
which is like a path shortening attack

790
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,940
prefix filtering prevents things like

791
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,800
stubs doing route leaks announcing paths

792
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,990
to widely<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are attacks that can</font>

793
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,340
even exist with secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP so what we</font>

794
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:45,780
actually see in the long term is that

795
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,120
prefix lists are something that should

796
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:49,290
continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be used along with secure</font>

797
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,360
routing because they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stop a</font>

798
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,680
different form of<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack the nice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

799
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,330
about prefix list is they're extremely

800
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,980
in current incrementally deployable you

801
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,909
want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in your a s use them</font>

802
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,100
you're done you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

803
00:25:56,910 --> 00:26:00,780
anyone else the real reason we focused

804
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,949
on economics<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this work is because</font>

805
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:03,750
secure routing really needs

806
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:11,040
participation from a lot of ISPs before

807
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:14,580
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any security properties hi rob c</font>

808
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">strim on my own behalf we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already have</font>

809
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">something called the IRR and we've had</font>

810
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:22,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">trouble getting really as much uptake as</font>

we might have in it on<font color="#CCCCCC"> due to it just</font>

being<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw a pain to do it right and it's</font>

813
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:34,290
that's bog simple compared to secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

814
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:36,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> curious as to you know you</font>

815
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:38,970
talked about government subsidies or

816
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:40,620
some sort of preferential treatment or

817
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,020
something like that but that can't be

818
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:45,600
something that you're advocating having

819
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:47,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen ad infinitum and there's there's</font>

820
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,990
a cost associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with doing this in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">particular and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

822
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:55,000
sort of one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things that we were</font>

823
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,190
discussing sort of

824
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,290
on the side while<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were making a</font>

825
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:01,870
presentation it's very analogous to the

826
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,909
credit card fraud problem right where if

827
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,409
the cost of solving the problem exceeds

828
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:09,520
the cost of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pain that you're getting</font>

829
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:11,170
from the problem it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes the</font>

830
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,020
smarter thing to do to just suck it up

831
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:15,850
and right off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the losses so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

832
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:19,240
wondering if you addressed any of the of

833
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:21,310
the more of the economic issues than you

834
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,890
then you alluded to here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're in</font>

835
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,450
your research<font color="#E5E5E5"> your model okay so you're</font>

836
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,550
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at actually so the question sort</font>

837
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:29,890
of asks what's the cost of suffering

838
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,389
from a routing attack versus the cost of

839
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:33,070
actually securing the routing

840
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,630
infrastructure so the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> is no we</font>

841
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,980
haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> address that at all so we were</font>

842
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:38,500
going from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this basic assumption that</font>

843
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,000
we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for defenses against</font>

844
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,740
strong attacks the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks that</font>

845
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,240
we have not seen yet today which by the

846
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:45,460
way we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to see because the</font>

847
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:46,660
easy attacks really work well right so

848
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:48,040
no we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually done an</font>

849
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,390
assessment for the costs of those

850
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,889
attacks and that would need a lot more

851
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:52,090
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> than what I have right now to be</font>

852
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:54,130
able to comment on but that's a really

853
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:55,540
good point what we're thinking about

854
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this is we really want to secure</font>

855
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,420
routing infrastructure and this is how

856
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,290
we need to get there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if we're</font>

857
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,130
going to do it this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how we're going</font>

858
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:01,990
to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

859
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:04,150
quantification of what kind of financial

860
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:05,710
losses we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> suffer from let's say</font>

861
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,960
someone decides to take down the u.s. is

862
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:14,500
bgp system right so I don't have any

863
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:16,400
date on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so this is the last</font>

864
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:19,520
question

865
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:21,380
hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> crispy softlayer technologies as a</font>

866
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,940
stub network and content providers there

867
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,620
any incentive for me to be an early

868
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:32,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">adopter or just wait for my up streams</font>

to secure me not on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">considered so your incentives would be</font>

871
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:42,680
more security incentives another thing

872
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:44,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you</font>

873
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,460
might be creating like a secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> island</font>

874
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,409
starting at yourself if you become

875
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,850
secure and if you're a multi-homed that

876
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:51,320
can sort of create incentives for your

877
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,879
providers to fight over serving you

878
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,070
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and potentially become secure</font>

879
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,660
but we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really look at economic</font>

880
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,280
incentives for that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the main</font>

881
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a stub isp would want to</font>

882
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,610
become secures for its own security

883
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">interests I guess just in the models</font>

884
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,090
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stubs don't</font>

885
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,260
really earn money from providing transit

886
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:13,040
so we couldn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to</font>

887
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:14,600
model those economic incentives sorry

888
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,450
I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to jump in for a second Jared</font>

889
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,550
moss for the ngt um actually actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

890
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,680
actually see a disincentive for players

891
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,030
like soft player to use for doing

892
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,370
something like this because they'll end

893
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,170
up their goal is to optimize their

894
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,270
utilization of their multiple upstream

895
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,730
providers and if one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of their upstream</font>

896
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:33,770
providers then actually secures the

897
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,360
routing system they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to end up</font>

898
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,280
with polarization of their traffic on

899
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,649
their path and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually going to</font>

900
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:42,710
destroy their network te so I think

901
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's some space here to continue to</font>

902
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,750
look at your model and some of these

903
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:49,970
subsequent consequences that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob also</font>

904
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,080
raised about the subsidization and

905
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,500
actually convincing people to actually

906
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,120
secure their systems because the CD ends

907
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,740
and the hosting companies they really

908
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,879
actually care about their their network

909
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,710
performance a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than they</font>

910
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,200
actually care about a little minor

911
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,790
security bullet yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely agree</font>

912
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,230
with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually so one of the things</font>

913
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:08,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this work is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're assuming</font>

914
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:10,040
that more traffic is good that's not

915
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,600
always true if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an engineered</font>

916
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,129
your network to deal with more traffic

917
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,480
so yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really important issue</font>

918
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we didn't model in this because</font>

919
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was complicated enough for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us at</font>

920
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,429
this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the point that i want</font>

921
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:20,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make to this room is that secure</font>

922
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,920
routing will impact traffic engineering

923
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,750
and so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to think</font>

924
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,310
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you sort of take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away one</font>

925
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,900
point maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> buy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that</font>

926
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,950
you want all of your traffic to go

927
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,690
through secure path because that may

928
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,169
burn out one of your legs but the fact

929
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,549
that the trash

930
00:30:30,169 --> 00:30:33,499
engineering will be affected by this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

931
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:35,059
think is an important thing both as an

932
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:36,799
advantage and a disadvantage but mostly

933
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:39,340
as we see it as an advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

934
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:39,340
thank you
