00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:11,219
i'm john curran I'm the president and

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,169
CEO of Aaron I have been it with errands

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:16,830
since its inception as I found one of

4
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:19,380
the founders and served as<font color="#E5E5E5"> chairman I'm</font>

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,299
presently president and CEO but I've

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,150
also in the past run it built and run a

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,880
couple of networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually come to</font>

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:28,439
nana to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet with old people employees</font>

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,689
used to work with me quite a few are in

10
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,030
the room right now so I'm going to talk

11
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:35,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> his ipv4 address transfers in the</font>

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,230
iron region reason to talk about this is

13
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:39,629
it's easier for you to hear it once from

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,489
me then try to hear it third-hand

15
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">secondhand third hand or fourth hand</font>

16
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:46,078
from other people it's also true that

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,500
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated to some extent it is</font>

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,180
not trivial and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here to explain</font>

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,199
it so you can say yes I heard John say

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,090
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I went and looked up the</font>

21
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:56,460
reference materials rather than having

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,079
to take a guess at<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you might read a</font>

23
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:04,140
blog somewhere so first thing do we have

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,300
ipv4 space available as Jeff<font color="#CCCCCC"> fussell</font>

25
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,390
eloquently said yes we do in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Aaron</font>

26
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,119
region still we publish an inventory

27
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,030
online each and every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if you're</font>

29
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,909
the lower right hand corner you will see

30
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,460
as of this morning we have 4.95

31
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:25,920
equivalents of / 8<font color="#CCCCCC"> available and that</font>

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,949
goes down routinely I've never seen it

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,729
go up<font color="#CCCCCC"> it goes down ETA to depletion</font>

34
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:37,020
early 2012 somewhere between december

35
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:38,460
maybe january very hard to predict<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,710
would have said the end of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,889
quarter but we're seeing a remarkable

38
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,020
uptake one interesting side effect of

39
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,899
telling people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're running out is</font>

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,399
they seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to realize they should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

41
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,110
while they can we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> a remarkable</font>

42
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,310
uptick in requests for address space in

43
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,990
February third right after the Miami

44
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,750
nanog meeting there was an event<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

45
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">that event actually had an impact to how</font>

46
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:08,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aaron processes certain types of</font>

47
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,800
requests so ipv4 requests this is coming

48
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,930
to Aaron looking for address space prior

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,960
to februari prior to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ayana free pool</font>

50
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,790
run out you could request 12 months

51
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,400
of your address space need<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever your</font>

52
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,530
need was based on your past utilization

53
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,840
we would issue you 12 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

54
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,630
additional space once the<font color="#CCCCCC"> row not</font>

55
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,670
occurred the second paragraph kicked in

56
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,250
which means you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> now request up to</font>

57
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,260
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> months of address space so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

58
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">have address space but we're giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

59
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,450
out in quarter cups instead of cups or

60
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,220
you know 250 milliliters as opposed to a

61
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,170
leader but whatever you want you get a

62
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,660
smaller slice now and you have to come

63
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,399
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> more often this is a pain in case</font>

64
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,430
you're curious this means we're

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,830
effectively processing more requests to

66
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,510
give out the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of space we're</font>

67
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,120
not a big fan of it either but it's to

68
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,769
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that everyone has some sort of</font>

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,920
equitable landing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're all</font>

70
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:05,400
requesting space and running<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,500
approximately in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> even basis now this</font>

72
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,210
doesn't affect transfers you actually

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">can find someone else who has address</font>

74
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,280
space and if they can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it available</font>

75
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,470
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can persuade them to give</font>

76
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,630
it to you you can have us transfer up to

77
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,340
12 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> from them to you so you can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">only get three months from Aaron but we</font>

79
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,910
will process transfers for up to 12

80
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:26,700
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> worth of your knee just as you</font>

81
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:29,609
used to be able to request so let's talk

82
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:31,230
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that specify transfer policy all</font>

83
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:33,330
the policies in the Aaron region are

84
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,609
developed in an open mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

85
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,830
open<font color="#CCCCCC"> public policy development process</font>

86
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:40,020
you don't have to be a member of Aaron

87
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:42,030
anyone can<font color="#E5E5E5"> participate we have this</font>

88
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,980
mailing list called PP ml that gets a

89
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,080
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> messages every day and you get to</font>

90
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,489
participate and it's fun you get to

91
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,890
participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the meetings either</font>

92
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:51,450
remotely or on-site well one of the

93
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,179
policies of the community developed is

94
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:57,060
the specified transfer policy and it

95
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,620
allows parties to recognize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

96
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,450
may want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transfer addresses from one</font>

97
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,010
to another because they have addresses

98
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,899
they don't need maybe they're using them

99
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,850
inefficiently maybe they got a huge

100
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,310
allocation the earliest<font color="#CCCCCC"> days of the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet someone else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needs them that's</font>

102
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">great it improves the overall efficiency</font>

103
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,900
of the system to get those addresses

104
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,480
back into play get them back into<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

105
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,030
with an organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that does so the</font>

106
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,250
policy provides to transfer to a

00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,840
qualified recipient and a qualified

109
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,250
says I have need just as just as used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

110

and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> even the service that we</font>

115
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,020
have I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about on the next slide</font>

116
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:45,900
Aaron's here to process the requests

117
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,820
we're not involved in party a and potty

a recipient<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can come to Aaron and</font>

127
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,580
say hey I'm requesting 12 months worth

128
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,740
of address space please<font color="#CCCCCC"> prequalify me we</font>

129
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,020
will process your application will ask

130
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">for your allocation history will look at</font>

131
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,010
your switz or look at your online

132
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,950
updates<font color="#CCCCCC"> tarrant online and will qualify</font>

133
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,969
you to receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain size block</font>

134
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:27,900
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a recipient gets</font>

135
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:29,400
pre-qualified how about for a seller if

136
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,979
you're selling address space well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

137
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,719
so the way you do that is you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

138
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,300
under a registry agreement either an RSA

139
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,130
or legacy registry agreement if you've

140
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,840
registered then we vetted you and we've

141
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,669
made<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that you either registered</font>

142
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,710
holder and that means you eat the

143
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,659
requirements for transferring it so if

144
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,669
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be certain as long as you</font>

145
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,190
met the prerequisites the transfer

146
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:51,510
should go through very smoothly now some

147
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,580
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I don't want to engage with</font>

148
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,560
Aaron I don't want to do this fine you

149
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:57,270
can still process a transfer but

150
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,730
recognize if we find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

151
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,770
trying to sell you address space was

152
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:03,270
never the registered holder well it's

153
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,120
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously that's</font>

154
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,549
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wire registry exists we're not part</font>

155
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,590
of the compensation by the way you know

156
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:14,340
they give you address space you give

157
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:15,869
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> money you give them chocolate chip</font>

158
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,909
cookies we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we don't want chocolate</font>

159
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:19,590
chip cookie we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want the money okay</font>

160
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:22,110
we do charge an administrative fee for

161
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:24,020
processing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transfer but the reality</font>

162
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,580
is that it's between those two parties

163
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,960
okay why do we have this policy we have

164
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,990
this policy again because the community

165
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,909
and you are this community decided that

166
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,860
you wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow transfers if we</font>

167
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:37,590
didn't have this we wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

168
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,030
recognize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was a need for</font>

169
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:41,190
address space that some people were

170
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to fulfill but not update the</font>

171
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:44,130
registry this

172
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:48,599
allows us to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have more accurate registry</font>

173
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:50,820
information in fact of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 most</font>

174
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,860
recent transfers that have occurred I

175
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,409
know four or five of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them were for one</font>

176
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,570
dollar an organization that used to be

177
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,580
affiliated with another had led another

178
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:01,950
organization use their address space and

179
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,510
now it's five years later and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

180
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:05,400
separate companies and they forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

181
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,830
update the records and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> one dollar</font>

182
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,510
they can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that slice and transfer to</font>

183
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,909
them as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the recipients using it</font>

184
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:13,950
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely qualified so we</font>

185
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:16,440
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that the transfer policy is</font>

186
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:20,130
making for more accurate records I think

187
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,830
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing okay specified</font>

188
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:24,600

189
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,690
transfer policy this is an optional

190
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,430
service and we had suggestions from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

191
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">community to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so we're putting it</font>

192
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:34,470
in and what it is is if you have address

193
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">space you can make available well you</font>

194
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,920
have a need for address space and you

195
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,740
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be contacted by people who have</font>

196
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,990
it it's a listing service that lets

197
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,420
parties find contact information for

198
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,370
each other in fact if you're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

199
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:49,910
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that wants to help parties</font>

200
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,530
find each other you're facilitating

201
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,500
buyers and sellers you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also</font>

202
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,659
participate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so those needing</font>

203
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,520
address space those who have address

204
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,310
space available and those who want to

205
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,390
play facilitator or moderator or

206
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:08,280
matchmaker so why won't you want to get

207
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,289
involved well if you need a if you have

208
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,650
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space and you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making it</font>

209
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,930
available you can use the stls to see

210
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,969
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not someone's potentially</font>

211
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:23,880
interested if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have address space you</font>

212
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,680
can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to call you by listing it</font>

213
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,740
as available for sale in the listing

214
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,720
service there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> even a business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model in</font>

215
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,730
just matching buyers and sellers again

216
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,590
not Aaron's job but if you want to be

217
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,810
matchmaker you can do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and participate</font>

218
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:38,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">in this um there's going to be a lot of</font>

219
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">people doing this right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

220
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,850
region we don't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of demand</font>

221
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,810
because you can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> get address space</font>

222
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:47,370
but I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> very confident once we no</font>

223
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,780
longer have address space in the region

224
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,630
you're going to see a lot more address

225
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,420
space transferring hands so that's the

226
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,800
listing service and it's again<font color="#CCCCCC"> optional</font>

227
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,370
you don't have to do this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can come</font>

228
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,649
Aaron you can meet at the Bering gear

229
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,350
find each other come to Aaron and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

230
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:07,260
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> update the registry but if you want</font>

231
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:08,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be contacted or you want to make it</font>

232
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,890
known you're looking for address space

233
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,279
this is a way to put your contact

234
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:15,870
information out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's a</font>

235
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:17,700
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick summary isn't that great I</font>

236
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,070
may actually be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to catch us all up</font>

237
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,620

241
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,730
involved in Aaron I don't want to harp

242
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,950
on this but these policies affect your

243
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:38,250
life and their adopted by a bunch of

whether you participate or not aaron has

are their policies that it's affecting

in our community well any given moment

much as you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a registry as</font>

289
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,590
being a fairly simple list of of address

290
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:51,959
blocks and and registries it's actually

291
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:55,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very complicated inverted tree of</font>

292
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,200
address space and of registries both

293
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:01,380
linked to one another when you do a

294
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,570
transfer there's four<font color="#E5E5E5"> or five different</font>

295
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:07,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways you can decide to reflect that in</font>

296
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:09,270
the rpki tree so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do know that there's</font>

297
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,890
been a lot of interest and I'm hoping

298
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the rirs will get together and</font>

299
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:16,860
document how they won't propose to

300
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,480
handle transfers in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki because that</font>

301
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,120
will affect what type of transfers

302
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,040
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could constrain transfer</font>

303
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,320
policy based on the technology that's

304
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">used in the particular constraints so</font>

305
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,570
that's again another reason to try to

306
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:33,359
get involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> here ok thank you I hope</font>

307
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,400
that we will see an answer on the side

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mailing list about just as well yes</font>

00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,839
inter r RI are transfers working yellow

315
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:02,400
in Terraria<font color="#CCCCCC"> are transfers right now</font>

316
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,410
something that's being discussed in

317
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,060
nearly every region

318
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:10,480
we have some challenges you actually

319
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to agree on a philosophy for how to</font>

320
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,460
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter re our transfers and to do</font>

321
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,670
that you're either going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

322
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:23,100
global policy that requires a five-way

323
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:27,880
match or a pairwise coordinated policy

324
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:31,510
we've had success at neither now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rer</font>

325
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:33,610
system is in some ways a remarkable

326
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,920
success because if we can't agree on

327
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,290
something we don't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and so that's</font>

328
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,300
our present status we can't agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it</font>

329
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:43,560
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing it there's a meeting</font>

330
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:46,120
in two weeks time maybe one week time

331
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,319
enough that has someone in Singapore of

<font color="#E5E5E5">I can and I know that both the ICANN</font>

334
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,820
council the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GAC have asked the rirs to</font>

335
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,500
talk a little bit about our progress

336
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,170
handling things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter re our</font>

337
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:08,170
transfers so we'd really like to get

338
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:10,270
some functional policies here we'll all

339
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,969
be talking to our respective communities

340
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,730
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks to say let's see if we</font>

341
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,670
can achieve workable policies the reason

342
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:22,660
it's so important by the way is not

343
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:24,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily because we have to have a</font>

344
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:28,060
working in Terraria our transfer policy

345
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:30,010
because operators need it to survive a

346
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,650
lot of operators have realized they're

347
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:37,000
going to be moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> more towards v6 world</font>

348
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:39,280
ipv6 day has helped a lot and but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

349
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">true that without globally coordinated</font>

350
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,990
policies here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to see a lot</font>

351
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">of strange attempts and the last thing</font>

352
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:47,920
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer address space and</font>

353
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:52,030
the last thing we want is in accuracy in

354
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:56,349
the database so yes microphones are

355
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:58,140
still open<font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick question so the AP</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Nick is making their list of transfers</font>

00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,020
planning on doing that it does it

359
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,820
already exists it doesn't exist right

360
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,130
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're actually working on that it</font>

361
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:13,180
took us a while to catch up with just

362
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,320
getting ipv6 issues in our daily feed of

363
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,859
updates we actually got that

364
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,269
accomplished last month

365
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,550
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work on getting the</font>

366
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:22,220
results of transfers put into the same

367
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,339
daily feed so you can do an RSS to keep

368
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,899
track of that probably going to take a

369
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,120
little while to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happen because</font>

370
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,800
we'd like to do it automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

371
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,170
question is whether we bother to record

372
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,029
transfers manually I've been sending

373
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:40,430
updates<font color="#E5E5E5"> to PP ml i'll probably be doing</font>

374
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:44,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">that until the automations complete okay</font>

375
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:46,729
i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you 90 questions daryl</font>

376
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:49,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">smith TW telecom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if this</font>

377
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,680
transfer policy applies to pre<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron</font>

378
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:52,820
space sure can we talk about that

379
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually probably the</font>

380
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,390
coolest question it was going to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

381
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,310
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just didn't know how it was going to</font>

382
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:03,170
be asked so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it very simple</font>

383
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:04,310
Aaron's philosophy on this is that there

384
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,459
is an errand database that has

385
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,319
registrations all the registrations in

386
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:12,439
the database of subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron's policies</font>

387
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,200
that includes those that were in

388
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:19,130
existence from the earliest<font color="#E5E5E5"> days from</font>

389
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:22,339
DoD from sr<font color="#E5E5E5"> i-- from NSI when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> si</font>

390
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:24,860
transferred it to aaron we are the

391
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:26,360
registry for the region and our policies

392
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:28,820
apply to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the registrations both</font>

393
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,720
legacy and non legacy recently there's

394
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:34,880
been some interesting developments<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

395
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,260
guess we had a court case had a couple

396
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,930
of court cases actually but we've had

397
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:42,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">some visible ones Aaron actually</font>

398
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:45,050
interceded in one matter we got the

399
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:47,599
court to acknowledge that parties had

400
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,959
interests right we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest right</font>

401
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,430
certain rights in the their

402
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,279
registrations and that those rights

403
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:58,189
might be transferred in accordance with

404
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,110
our policies so we recognize the

405
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:02,420
database has lots of records in<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

406
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,490
those records we administer on behalf of

407
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:06,589
the community some people are the

408
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,559
registrar they have the right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the</font>

409
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">registrar they have the right to update</font>

410
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,589
but you guys have rights as well you

411
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,260
have the rights of visibility you have

412
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:19,668
the right to see the records<font color="#E5E5E5"> and those</font>

413
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:21,589
rights are actually mediated effectively

414
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:23,270
by the public policies if we have a

415
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:25,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">policy that says there shall be an</font>

416
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:27,168
administrative contact then everyone has

417
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:28,909
to put administrative contact in

418
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:29,690
regardless of whether it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> legacy</font>

419
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,179
registration

420
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,649
or a current registration if we have a

421
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:36,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy that affects the visibility of</font>

422
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:37,969
who is it's the same way the database<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

423
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,250
run according to policies developed by

424
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:43,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">the entire community and they apply to</font>

425
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:48,049
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the registrations in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> region so</font>

426
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:50,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay any more questions I hate to give</font>

427
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:54,580
you seven minutes of extra time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to eat</font>

428
00:17:50,389 --> 00:17:58,000
cookies last chance the microphones

thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for having me</font>
