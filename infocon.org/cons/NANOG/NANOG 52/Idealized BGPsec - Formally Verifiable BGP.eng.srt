1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:11,889
just so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this is done by a</font>

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:15,579
design team in outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ITF been</font>

3
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:17,590
meeting for about three years and many

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:20,080
of them are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room and it's a</font>

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:24,100
conspiracy of operators and vendors and

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:29,130
computer scientists and even government

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:32,290
people so on sunday<font color="#E5E5E5"> i did a workshop</font>

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:36,220
here on the resource public key

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:39,250
infrastructure which is an x.509 based

10
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:42,040
hierarchy<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm describing address space</font>

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,290
you know it's being rolled out by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron</font>

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,350
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other registries let's assume</font>

13
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,210
also that route origin authorizations

14
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,000
are there so we have a way of formally

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:54,750
and cryptographically verifying that ASU

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,160
has the right to announce that<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix</font>

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,899
let's assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a way of</font>

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,449
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> this into routers and by the way</font>

19
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,879
by assume we have current running code

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:07,240
and on Sunday we had a workshop<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

21
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:11,880
so it's in routers and so the routers

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,500
can actually decide that hey that prefix

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,110
should not have been announced by this a

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:20,830
s but this announcement from this is is

25
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:26,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and can be tested and you can set</font>

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:32,880
your routing policy based on about a

27
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:34,990
validation state of formal cryptographic

28
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,880

30
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:46,598
registries the problem with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

31
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:49,890
simple that this relied on data which

32
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:54,670
although the allocation trace is

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:58,420
cryptographically assured the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

34
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:04,360
announcement the origin<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that we saw</font>

35
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:08,610
here is not cryptographically assured so

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can forge the origin is that matches</font>

37
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:16,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpki so and therefore sneak past</font>

38
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,870
this because there's no Krypto assurance

39
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,680
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s origin or</font>

40
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:25,239
now this does not make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpki based</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> published a s relationships similar</font>

to where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> irr publishes it and so it</font>

65
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:55,179
showed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this could be the valid path</font>

66
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:57,549
because Abe was connected to be but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,349
problem is the policy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the global</font>

68
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:01,629
internet changes every thirty six

69
00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:05,310
milliseconds that has been measured no

70
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:07,870
it hasn't that's a joke sorry um and

71
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,509
because new circuits come up new

72
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,389
relationships are formed new customers

73
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:17,108
are turned up circuits break etc etc

74
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:19,690
routers never break of course um and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

75
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:24,609
what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a protocol to distribute</font>

76
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:29,139
policy right now it's called<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp okay</font>

77
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:31,569
that tells you not whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mary should</font>

78
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,270
have announced the prefix to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Joe</font>

79
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:38,050
but it will tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> pardon me Bob</font>

80
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:40,929
it will tell you that mary did announce

81
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,330
it to Joe we cannot guess Mary's intent

82
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:46,958
we cannot guess merit Mary's business

83
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:48,688
model etc whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> she should have</font>

84
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,669
announced that the Bob will never know

85
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:55,179
whether she did announce it to Bob we

86
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:58,448
can formally validate so the purpose of

87
00:04:55,179 --> 00:05:02,859
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> exercise is to validate that the</font>

88
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:06,219
protocol is correct to deal with attacks

89
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:11,050
on the protocol not to deal with tax on

90
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:15,699
business policy or intent<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I'm going</font>

91
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:17,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a simple attack um much more</font>

92
00:05:15,699 --> 00:05:21,069
complicated attacks are the interesting

93
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:27,550
ones it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> great if Tony gave his</font>

it to a w also announces it to Z Z lies

97
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:44,550
Z tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> X I have a direct connection to</font>

98
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:48,430
be that makes it a competitive path

99
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:52,569
tiebreaker says<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh money goes this way z</font>

100
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:57,279
steals it sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back on its way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

101
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:59,349
it's shortened the path what we're going

102
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:06,759
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent it will call forward</font>

103
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:09,479
path signing and that is when<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SN sends</font>

104
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:13,539
an announcement forward to a SN plus 1

105
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:18,149
it signs the announcement saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am in</font>

107
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:27,729

onward to X or more interestingly to Z

112
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:48,060
it says hey hi I'm w i'm using<font color="#CCCCCC"> my key to</font>

113
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:52,230
towards<font color="#CCCCCC"> e and encapsulate the previous</font>

114

00:06:57,390 --> 00:07:03,840
does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an announcement from be</font>

lie so the traffic now this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie</font>

doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work this sky gets the</font>

money send it here saying that years

do in here is even example of it we

signing as probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a slide</font>

290
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,520
ordering problem is that I can't use

297
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,709
because i have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to forward sign towards</font>

298

00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:10,130

302
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,500
that that signatures there because the

group number rule<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the game is</font>

304

downstream a esas when they want to do a

of the prefix counts 30 hack 13.4 but

307
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:27,620
that now we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

optimizations we're refraining from the

this is just another bgp decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

313
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,060
the router is going to look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and</font>

say<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep</font>

408
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:57,840
it was felt that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the deployment window</font>

409
00:22:55,419 --> 00:23:01,139
for this was far enough out that ecs

hey Eric ostrov our son loves I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

412
00:23:05,019 --> 00:23:09,730
a quick question I didn't completely

413
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:12,220
follow the routers that generate their

414
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:24,600
own keys and upload them could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you okay</font>

415
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:27,879
how that works exactly so so we need the

416
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,199
certificate blobs signed blobs for each

417
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:34,449
router the sign blobs have a public key

418
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only place the private key is needed</font>

419
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:40,419
is in the router because the router

420
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:44,679
wants to sign with it so the router just

421
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:47,019
like it does in ssh today could generate

422
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:50,230
its own private key you'd say crypto

423
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:52,480
blah blah blah<font color="#E5E5E5"> and crisco and it would</font>

424
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:57,279
generate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the private key would give you</font>

425
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:59,619
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public key and you would hand it to</font>

426
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,980
the rpki and say here's my public key

427
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:05,320
give me a router cert for it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

428
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,990
was just wondering if routers are able

429
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,210
to essentially generate their their

430
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,039
their authentication credentials which

431
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:14,470
of these keys that they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then use to</font>

432
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:16,929
sort of authenticate paths is there any

433
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:18,669
sort of entry authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that I</font>

434
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:20,590
can't you know intrude in your network

435
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,679
and stand up a rogue agent that uploads

436
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:28,059
a key and then looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a valid signer</font>

437
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:30,039
well if you did the if you wanted to do

438
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:34,539
the router generates its own key game

439
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:37,179
then the path by which that gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

440
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:39,929
the rpki is going to have to have

441
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:44,230
significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought that authenticity</font>

442
00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:47,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and one of the ways you might do</font>

443
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:52,059
that is wrap it in something signed by

444
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:54,489
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay see this this</font>

445
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:59,139
search has a private key somewheres and

446
00:24:54,490 --> 00:25:01,749
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could take the request wrap it not</font>

447
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:03,559
and at least you wouldn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

448
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:04,700
was the exact router doing it

449
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:09,999
but you'd know it was the same

450
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:09,999
administrative authority but<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks</font>

451
00:25:11,649 --> 00:25:22,059
Sharon<font color="#E5E5E5"> may we appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>
