mostly concerned with commercial traffic

7
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:24,710
because well and all honestly that's

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,538
where the money is however there is

18
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:48,200
unfortunately repeat a few of the things

19
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,059
Milo just talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about not too many</font>

repeat things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just heard useful to</font>

was the mill net it was the NSFNET these

78

were networks funded by typically the US

research useful also<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember as Milo</font>

90
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,900
said that back in the 1980s the network

91
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:45,149
the research networks were really

92
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,030
multi-protocol networks IP was not

93
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,280
dominant on at least the Department<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

Energy and NASA networks I believe there

95
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,170
was far more decnet traffic exchange at

96
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:57,810
that point than there was IP certainly

97
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,910
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS net there was quite a bit more IP</font>

98
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,700
was just a fairly<font color="#CCCCCC"> small percentage of</font>

100
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,958
<font color="#E5E5E5">because of the folks in high energy</font>

basically rent to do network research

not considered to be a high reliability

and quickly configured to do specific

362

basically competitor with internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font>

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,658
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does not happen and</font>

580
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:26,250
does not step on reserve bandwidth where

581
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:29,580
are we going in research networks well

582
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:31,230
more bad with surprise surprise most

583
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:33,389
research networks are currently trying

584
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:36,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">very hard to move 200 gigabit per second</font>

585
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:39,240
ways and replace the old slow painful 10

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,500
gigabit per second<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways which sounds</font>

587
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">really funny when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you remember the days</font>

588
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,730
of 9.6 kilobit networking we're looking

589
00:23:43,409 --> 00:23:47,460
at more efficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> use of the spectrum</font>

590
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,409
getting more data into a single fiber

591
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:51,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a critical area because fibers</font>

592
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:53,320
are expensive electronics are relatively

593
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,149
cheap the

594
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:57,399
of you who bought a WDM switch lightly

595
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:59,018
they're not real cheap but compared to

596
00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">running a fiber across the country it's</font>

597
00:23:59,019 --> 00:24:04,210
cheap so that's one of our goals the

598
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,620
other is to enhance middleware to make

599
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,990
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficient use of our available</font>

600
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,149

00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:13,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">oscar's to better schedule bandwidth</font>

602
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:15,518
including automated<font color="#E5E5E5"> three VPN creation</font>

603
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:18,190
when we see large flows that are ongoing

604
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,929
between locations move them basically to

605
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:22,840
the science data network automatically

606
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:25,269
and transparently our other major effort

607
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,830
is to tune end systems and for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> system that wants to move data</font>

618
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:51,129
rapidly across the network and right now

619
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:54,549
this is the hundred gigabit network that

620
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:57,459
yes net is working on building it should

out of stimulus money the advanced

networking initiative so the research

626
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:12,158
and commercial networks have a lot in

627
00:25:09,669 --> 00:25:14,320
common but their basic goals and needs

628
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,509
have diverged over the years such that

629
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,509
they are really separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> internets that</font>

00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:21,009
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to one another they</font>

639
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,580
be quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit different techniques and</font>

run faster data for example both could

644
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:52,509
quite possibly be very useful to

645
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:57,008
commercial providers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're free</font>

646
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:58,929
can't argue with a price and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> believe</font>

647
00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:00,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> more awareness of what the research</font>

648
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:02,379
networks are doing could be very

00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:03,260
beneficial to<font color="#E5E5E5"> those commercial folks out</font>

650
00:26:02,379 --> 00:26:05,060
there as well

651
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:08,990
that's one of the reasons I'm up here

652
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:11,870
and just finally on a side note this is

653
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:13,820
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> last week in es net and I want to</font>

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,510
this would be a very different<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:34,850
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to miss you out there and as I</font>

go sailing off to a new sunrise in

663
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:38,469
Hawaii this next weekend

664
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,290
hmm well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you Kevin Kevin spent a</font>

00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,990
great member of the pc helped us got

helped us put together all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

667
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:58,070
talks I guess you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting some</font>

668
00:26:55,010 --> 00:27:01,580
questions here we can run into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the break</font>

669
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,960
for a little bit just<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember this is</font>

670
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're cutting into the break here so</font>

671
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,840
try to keep it fairly brief or the

672
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:12,379
natives will revolt the front Mike

673

Michael Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sinatra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um yes i almost</font>

674
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,790
said UC Berkeley yes net first of all as

675
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:18,290
one of the it takes two people to

676
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,970
replace Kevin is one of the two people

677
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,440
replacing him I want to thank him for

678
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,120
all he's done for now knock over the

679
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:36,380
years and four es net and for me

680
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:38,600
personally yeah I recently ran into a

681
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,310
video on youtube<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a gentleman who</font>

682
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:42,469
claims<font color="#E5E5E5"> that internet too is a giant</font>

683
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:45,290
conspiracy by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government to retake</font>

684
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:48,170
over the internet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has an AUP</font>

685
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:50,690
and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses the internet to logo so</font>

686
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,790
clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> he has enough basis in reality</font>

687
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:54,620
that he must have read something about

688
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,879
internet too<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering if you</font>

689
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,350
could respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that or research</font>

00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">world and and if so what's it going to</font>

692
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:07,310
look like oh my gosh somebody's

693
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:08,750
discovered our secret plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're do now</font>

694
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,909
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think research networks are</font>

695
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:14,560
going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the network for one</font>

696
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:17,150
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have nearly enough money</font>

697
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:18,590
and by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that he has for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to hear more about optical switching</font>

710
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:57,449
well what happened to it why

711
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,980
we have a great deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of optical</font>

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,950
switching we just don't have optical

713
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,300
routing every every year Rotom out there

714
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:08,760
is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> optical switching at some point</font>

00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,409
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not really sure there was an</font>

00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,640
it for the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of years it's</font>

721
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:25,470
really really difficult to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

722
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,150
without getting electronics involved at

723
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,770
some point today our photonics just

724
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:30,870
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe developed anywhere near</font>

725
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:34,350
that point I can assure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

726
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:37,949
research is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still ongoing into that but</font>

727
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:39,659
not by those in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

728
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,180
community but by individual researchers

729
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,100
at universities and other research sites

730
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,920
and whether it'll ever come to fruition

731
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,810
I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea I kind of suspect that it</font>

732
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:53,370
will I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's going to be real</font>

733
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:55,050
soon don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody else so hey run</font>

734
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,149
for the break the goodies are out there

735
00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:00,470
I hope yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's come back at</font>

736
00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:00,470
eleven-thirty thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all</font>
