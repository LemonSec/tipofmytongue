1
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,990
we've gained over the years I don't

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,670
think you'll hear a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's new but</font>

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:16,240
hopefully what I can bring through a bit

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:18,340
is how the thinking of operators is

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:20,229
evolving as it deals with the mobile

6
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,359
data revolution that's going on and

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,720
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know while I don't typically</font>

8
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:27,820
like to mention competing products

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,650
clearly the seminal event in the

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,240
industry with mobile data was the

11
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:32,650
introduction of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> iPhone because</font>

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,780
that's what really<font color="#E5E5E5"> got people's</font>

13
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:36,430
attention around what the power of a

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,140
mobile data network could provide and

15
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,390
what kind of capabilities could be

16
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,690
embodied in the phone and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that goes</font>

17
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:47,080
back you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 57 years now so let me</font>

18
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:49,269
talk a little bit about and I presume

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,769
we're all good with the streaming and

20
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:52,300
all that because it says do not close

21
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:55,600
desktop presenter I have not touched

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,919
anything except<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> page down button but</font>

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,470
let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> let me talk a little bit about</font>

24
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,540
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> again none of this for</font>

00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">many of you this may not be I want to</font>

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,890
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the yardhouse or I guess there's this</font>

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,830

29
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,840
become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mayor of a location if you</font>

30
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:17,080
happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to frequent it so presumably</font>

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,510
there's a mayor of the hard rock cafe at

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,370
this point but those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the types one</font>

33
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,200
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the several elements of</font>

34
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,260
expectations that our customers now have

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,530
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> also find a proliferation wireless</font>

36
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:35,200
and almost every conceivable device from

37
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:37,479
cameras to play stations to even SD

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
cards to have built-in Wi-Fi to them and

39
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:41,500
so the question is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bring all</font>

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,380
that together in a seamless experience

41
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:47,470
and then how does it in turn access the

42
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:51,250
global network for uploading to<font color="#E5E5E5"> facebook</font>

or to your website or whatever we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

44
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,930
finding or as i talked to CIOs and did

45
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:58,179
our customers of ours they're a bit

46
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,090
struggling with how they take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage</font>

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,369
of this mobility capability you know

48

several years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could kind of</font>

49

dictate the type of device a an employee

this points have punted

55
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:22,290
that idea because they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that their</font>

56
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,090
employees want to have choice if they

want an<font color="#CCCCCC"> iPhone they're going to buy an</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">very powerful device in their hand and</font>

how do I make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can</font>

66
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,329

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,780
so how that gets integrated into their

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sums up into it is effectively</font>

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,170
prior to true 4G networks and I'm

it's an expectation the customers have

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,820
and it gives you the flatness and the

84

<font color="#CCCCCC">availability of getting out to the</font>

you've got IP all the way to the phone

00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,150

00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:12,640
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> demands on spectrum that is now</font>

176
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:15,130
becoming the number one thing that's the

177
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">topic of the industry is spectrum where</font>

178
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,450
is it coming from there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,700
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that assert that their merger</font>

180
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:25,390
is going to somehow magically create

181
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,950
more spectrum to enable that's a bit of

182
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:29,080
a hallow argument from my point of view

183
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,030
but nonetheless spectrum is very

184
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,789
important how efficiently we use that

185
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:38,710
spectrum is extremely extremely

186
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:40,960
important there are two components to to

187
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,640
the data usage I've talked about tonnage

188
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,190
but the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that drives us crazy</font>

189
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,990
are the number of connections in other

190
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:49,210
words the number of session requests we

191
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:53,350
get on the network from a mobile device

192
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:55,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it is staggering the rate of growth</font>

193
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:59,260
of just the pings to the network from

194
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,450
devices like a handheld smartphone have

195
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,670
grown exponentially just on the same

connections expand dramatically

200
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,880
exponentially on our network because of

201
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">the proliferation of a large number of</font>

midst of of trying to address now

207

connections in and of themselves they

208
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,799
tend to impact the core elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

291
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,860
based technology or we could choose to

292
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,199
go to LT in the future which is also

293
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,670
essentially a mobile IP type of

294
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,029
infrastructure both of which are very

295
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast and both of which are really in the</font>

296
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:05,410
category of being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a true IP network so</font>

297
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,420
this this platform is the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

298
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,819
decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in order to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give us that</font>

299
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:12,099
flexibility and ability to grow in the

00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:33,569
choosing to enable on the bottom half

310
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,579
you'll see a core network modernization

311
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,740
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> partway through an</font>

312
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:41,290
ip-based core infrastructure for voice

313
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,019
and data you know data is IP at a point

314
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,329
this project takes it the rest of the

315
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:48,399
way where we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> now unbundle all the</font>

316
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:50,859
elements of the network embed them in

317
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,140
our ims infrastructure and then allow

318
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,149
ourselves to create more flexible

319
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,370
services using the building blocks of

320
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:59,820
all the attributes of the network and

321
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:03,430
put it together in applications that

322
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,890
customers will will use and enjoy right

323
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,540
now you can get part part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ims</font>

324
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:09,490
and part of them aren't and now this

325
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:11,740
will finish that job to put all

326
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:15,370
different sorts of capabilities and make

327
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,459
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> accessible for IP based services and</font>

328
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:20,860
infrastructure the only other point I'll

329
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:23,199
make on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the bandwidth</font>

330
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,329
drives us to to an Ethernet backhaul

331
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:27,309
network versus a TDM base

332
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:29,618
the push-to-talk modernization is that

333
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:32,259
is really more of a it's very much

334
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:34,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">oriented on a challenge that we have in</font>

335
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:37,239
trying to consolidate our two wireless

336
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,160
networks into a single one in<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

337
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:42,519
do that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy a push-to-talk</font>

338
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,559
product that not only duplicates what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">provided in our I 10 pitch to talk</font>

340
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,519

341
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,319
capabilities of a mobile data

342
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,879
infrastructure so now what I've talked

343
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:58,029
about is how we're particularly

344
00:13:54,879 --> 00:14:01,360
addressing the issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data growth</font>

345
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:03,160
by throwing hardware at it and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

346
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is sort of the arms race we're all</font>

347
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,730
in we pour a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money into the</font>

348
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,829
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fundamentally grow the</font>

349
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,439
capacity up to the limits of its

350
00:14:08,829 --> 00:14:13,508
spectrum in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to handle as much data</font>

351
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:15,849
as we can but that in itself is not a

352
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:19,449
sustainable option for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

353
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:21,249
find other ways to manage that<font color="#CCCCCC"> data flow</font>

354
00:14:19,449 --> 00:14:23,859
and still provide the in use or the

355
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:26,499
experience that we need and this is

356
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,899
something as a network operator really

357
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:31,179
changes a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> elements of what you</font>

358
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:35,110
have to deal with and you wind up

359
00:14:31,179 --> 00:14:37,059
needing to manage and surveil or service

360
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:39,879
manage a lot of elements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

361
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:41,949
basically outside of your control so if

362
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,389
you look in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the far right the</font>

363
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:45,488
offload concepts there's a lot of

364
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:47,439
discussion around Wi-Fi offload so the

365
00:14:45,489 --> 00:14:51,009
minute you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about Wi-Fi</font>

366
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:53,679
offload it's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> for operators that own</font>

367
00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:56,889
the large expensive wireless mobile

368
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:58,419
networks and if a customer's at home and

369
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:00,549
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a Wi-Fi network in their</font>

quest in the case of Denver or now

374
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:14,469
CenturyLink I guess you know those are

375
00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:16,329
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are good for us as a</font>

376
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:18,699
wireless operator it's good for the

377
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:21,040
customer because they'll have access<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

378
00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:24,699
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already paying for that that</font>

379
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,559
linkage but it's also a network vet as a

380
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:28,449
wireless operator we're not managing

381
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,488
that so how do you manage that service

experience and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a challenge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for us</font>

to any other network

388
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,550
kind of concept there are some emerging

389
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,770
technologies that are suggesting you

390
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:49,930
could actually combine the capabilities

391
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,090
of various networks that you have

392
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,760
wireless access to and combining that

into a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-speed pipe little</font>

you don't need quite as much bandwidth

guess maybe seven years or so to the

it's moved there for two reasons one is

00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,779
there's a lot of users and the most

512
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:37,539
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one is that these devices have</font>

00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:47,980
attacks and bots that are showing up on

516

they were browsing a marketplace and

578
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:30,230
downloaded a seemingly innocuous

579
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:32,570
application but in it was a bot that was

580
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:33,890
ready to be launched and those are the

581
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,740
types of things that we all need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

587
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,340
lot of hindrance for security is going

588
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,709
to be a bit counterintuitive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:53,689
general population<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't find</font>

590

ways to do that that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

593
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,560
kinds of risks so with that I'm going to

594
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,690
conclude I get us off to a hopefully a

595
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,480
raucous start their<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones still wake up</font>

596
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:12,740
there but hopefully you found some use

597
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,110
out of that but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line</font>

598
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,690
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the growth of mobile data</font>

599
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,310
it truly has become a mobile IP world

600
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,370
and that's something that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

601
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:24,950
three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago the industry had a full</font>

602
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:27,139
appreciation for how rapidly was going

603
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,280
to hit us and then all of the channel

604
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,600
lunch that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to bring with us</font>

605
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:33,770
both from the standpoint of managing the

606
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,980
limited spectrum resources we have

607
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:39,139
available to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us as well as the types of</font>

609
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:45,980
with it so with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sonja I'll turn it</font>

back over to you Bob<font color="#CCCCCC"> kami</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so I'd</font>

613
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,679
see the AT&T and t-mobile merger

614
00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:01,490
affecting some of the trends over the

615
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:05,050
next five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

616
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:07,040
interesting public policy debate I think

617
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:08,960
everyone probably knows by now that

618
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,020
sprint is adamantly opposed to the

619
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,030
eighteen t t-mobile merger we're doing

620
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:17,270
it on the basis of we don't think it's

621
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:18,760
good public policy to consolidate so

622
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,770
much of an industry and<font color="#E5E5E5"> two players</font>

623
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:24,740
because we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that along with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

624
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:27,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">comes less innovation less creativity</font>

625
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,930
competition fosters innovation so I'd

626
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:32,260
extend that in the context of the use of

627
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:34,550
the mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet they may be</font>

628
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,990
migrating our way back if that merger

629
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,899
goes through which of course we hope it

630
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:40,370
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not might be migrating back into a</font>

about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you think about for those</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of you interested in politically active</font>

I would encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know</font>

636
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,300
support our cause because we do think

00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,480
it's right for the country and white

638
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:59,060
right for consumers but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do i do worry</font>

639
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,770
a lot that the concentration of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

641
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:06,560
duopoly structure will effectively slow

<font color="#E5E5E5">down innovation and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Mike very</font>

effectively manage the internet growth

but for all the wrong reasons okay i

645
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:18,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">just got a question over i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am so before</font>

646
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,929
we open it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is they</font>

647
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:24,679
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask you about the ipv6 support</font>

648
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:25,700
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sprint's wireless network as are</font>

649
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,590
afraid of getting that question because

650
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,060
it's not one I'm terribly well versed in

651
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:30,949
and it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a former sprint</font>

652
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,020
employee by the way who just<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate</font>

653
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,460
there's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of former splint</font>

654

656
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:41,519
great talent to the industry

657
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:43,409
we do support it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we just</font>

658
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,570
participate in the ipv6 day which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:51,840
that's right we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know early</font>

661
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:53,940
into the ipv6 and it is obviously some

662
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,009
place where we need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to get</font>

663
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,869
there in the right way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we are ardent</font>

supporters of it and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

665
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:01,470
actually if you think about it with all

666
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:06,119
the devices coming on the network that's

667
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:09,210
yet another driver for why the ipv6 is

668
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:12,499
very very needed in the industry ok

669
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,499
let's open it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> for questions</font>

677
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:52,580
why does your industry call them abusers

00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,020
this on a normal daily basis for email

714
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:29,750
for facebooking it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven I don't know if</font>

715
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:32,060
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can drive 700 gigabits of usage off</font>

716
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:33,770
of facebook I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

717
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:36,830
personal use something else that that

718
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:40,460
customers using that for and and we also

719
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:42,530
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> other types of basic fraud uses</font>

720
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,140
that fall in that category and that's a

721
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:47,120
different category as well so no we we

722
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,070
embrace you know our philosophy least

723
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,290
I'll to speak for sprint it's twofold

724
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:53,689
one we have encouraged usage through our

725
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:55,909
unlimited<font color="#E5E5E5"> plans and if you look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at our</font>

726
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,490
plans I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> speaks very tangibly</font>

727
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:00,080
to our philosophy of we want customers

728
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,810
and I have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> too much about how</font>

729
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,980
they're using it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second thing is</font>

730
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:05,659
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> strong in our</font>

731
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:07,400
disclosures of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> open enablement</font>

732
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:09,890
environment meaning bring your

733
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,340
applications bring your ideas to our

734
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">network we will not encumber that from</font>

735
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:19,449
happening comes with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk of hoping</font>

736
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:22,880
that the applications are used wisely

737
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:24,530
there was an application as an example

738
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,650
and this is the type of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

739
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:30,200
have to work through where it was if a

740
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:33,050
device that sat in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a specific place</font>

741
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,170
didn't move<font color="#CCCCCC"> and ping the network every</font>

742
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:37,760
30 seconds why it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anywhere</font>

743
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,350
it's a big thing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't you know</font>

744
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,410
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fundamentally move could you</font>

745
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:44,689
ping every<font color="#E5E5E5"> minute or every five minutes</font>

746
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,700
to get it done that makes a huge

747
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,500
difference on the consumption of the

748
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,140
network resources and the wirless site

749
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:52,190
so that's something we do

750
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:53,600
collaboratively with the application

751
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:56,180
developers and what we're finding is

752
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,040
they understand now and are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

753
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,260
better and better at understanding the

754
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:02,870
implications of using the network so

755
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:06,160
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it well so we're not after</font>

756
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:08,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">the general customer we're not after I</font>

757
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,670
doubt that we're after I guess maybe

758
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,340
technically maybe two percent of you we

759
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:15,050
may be after I don't know but no we're

760
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:18,439
not we're not after<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you consider</font>

761
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:20,690
good heavy use good heavy use is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

762
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,630
over after we're after ones that clearly

763
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:27,230
it's something other than personal use

764
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:28,940
that you use them for yeah but great

765
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:32,090
question and I could tell with some

766
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:35,180
sentiment in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gentleman in</font>

767
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:39,740
the hi there Chris um I have a question

768
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:42,140
actually so are you sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the 750</font>

769
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:45,100
gig is a mobile phone user or it's not

770
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who just can't get</font>

771
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,830
fixed wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> or fixed fixed line</font>

772
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:49,270
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> someplace there are lots of</font>

773
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:50,620
places in this world where you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

774
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:53,860
fixed line access in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United States</font>

775
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:55,510
where you serve right there are lots of

776
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,750
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you can't get access and if</font>

777
00:31:55,510 --> 00:32:00,850
my company requires me to do work on the

778
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,260
network it may<font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet work</font>

779
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,490
right it might be their corporate

780
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,289
network but I might not get<font color="#E5E5E5"> there across</font>

781
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,900
a VPN and I might spend all day doing

782
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,280
big things for my company right there's

783
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:12,190
you you're not differentiating that

784
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,720
usage right sir and first off right and

785
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:15,549
second off you you're providing a

786
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,610
network service you're providing me an

787
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:19,720
IP address and access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the internets I</font>

788
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,820
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you really should care what</font>

789
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,720
I do with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if i surf the porn all</font>

790
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,070
day go for<font color="#E5E5E5"> goat porn right I mean that's</font>

791
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,620
it's perfectly legal in West Virginia

792
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:35,289
goat porn right no what we and we do

793
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,809
that police where you're going we're not

794
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:40,658
right I can guarantee you and I know for

795
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:42,270
certainty that these heavy users are in

796
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:46,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">areas where there's plenty of options</font>

797
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:48,549
this is not in a I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Colorado so I'm</font>

798
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">not in the hills of Colorado where there</font>

799
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,658
is no other option other than a wireless

800
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,760
provider this is in Corbin areas where

801
00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:57,659
we see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is where these users are and</font>

802
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:00,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point is is you're dealing with a</font>

803
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:02,830
limited public resource called spectrum

804
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:05,110
and we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it available to</font>

805
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:08,049
as many customers for reasonable<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount</font>

806
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:10,120
of use and I do and I do believe that

807
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:12,129
those the outliers are using it for

808
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,090
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> original intent</font>

809
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:18,909
and the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> user agreement so i guess it</font>

810
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:21,730
so so what I what I hear it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some</font>

811
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:24,159
extent is we can't build pops fast

812
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:26,230
enough to get spectrum out small enough

813
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,179
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas you know to serve as a</font>

814
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,770
small<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of small areas versus a</font>

815
00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:32,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">very larger and I don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

816
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:34,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into the debate about building</font>

817
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,299
networks because we're all that business

818
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,460
right now but I guess the message that

819
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:40,480
comes from not just you right you just

820
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,100
happened to be the guy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stage</font>

821
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,669
today from from most of the wireless

822
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:48,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">carriers at least in the u.s. is 00 me</font>

823
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:52,299
it's it's very hard we have limited

824
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:54,219
spectrum yeah it's these people they do

825
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,900
these things that are that are and you

826
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,720
actually said sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like they do these</font>

827
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,309
things that are

828
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,240
legal right i mean you sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> her</font>

829
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:03,230
casting the customer in a criminal light

830
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,120
you know there are lots of use cases

831
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:06,650
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can make lots of bandwidth</font>

832
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,560
appear on the network for legitimate

833
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,510
things mm-hmm right and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i may have</font>

834
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,320
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that for my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> job or for my</font>

835
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:17,480
livelihood and i bought a service right

836
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,399
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I bought a fios link to my</font>

837
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,590
house I could have just as easily bought

838
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:24,399
sprint my company may require that i use

839
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:27,260
the sprint wireless card to do my<font color="#CCCCCC"> job</font>

840
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:29,569
companies are weird right not everyone

841
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,869
says just go pick whatever IP access you

842
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:36,530
want have a good time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I well do you</font>

843
00:34:32,869 --> 00:34:39,109
suggest that the that it's okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us</font>

844
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:42,260
to lose money to provide the service

845
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:44,029
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious is it okay to look for us</font>

846
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,929
to lose money to provide the service

847
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:51,290
Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> bush i oj if you cannot provide</font>

848
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:54,470
the customer what they want to buy of

849
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:58,460
your service then your business model<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

850
00:34:54,469 --> 00:35:00,290
broken i would agree and so for that

851
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:04,220
customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would be happy to offer them</font>

852
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:06,800
a plan on a per megabyte basis that they

853
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,118
would not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to afford I mean how</font>

854
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,250
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that though well we don't</font>

855
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,950
know that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm guessing it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

that's what a lot of companies do or the

network like I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sprint's currently</font>

933

doing and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our customers do it's</font>

934
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,250
a business decision it's not necessarily

935
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:48,480
stating that it's wrong or right but

936
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,480
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only two methods it's</font>

937
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,700

00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,710
pay that they're not they're not going

to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to just say screw</font>

but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going to happen unless</font>

947
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:20,060
it's not going to happen can you come up

00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:22,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic please he's just there you go</font>

949
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,770
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> fired up about this for a long</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">time so I'm sorry I'm just saying it one</font>

951
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:28,680
of one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of several things will happen</font>

952
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,610
either the users will change their

953
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,680
behavior which is a benefit to you guys

954
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:37,020
to reduce their usage for for the same

955
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,879
or only slightly more they will either

956
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,920
do that or they will start paying more

957
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,960
or they will completely leave your

958
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,280
network yes that may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a problem but</font>

959
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,510
eventually they're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out</font>

960
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:48,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they either have the same problem</font>

961
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:51,180
on other networks and they just have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

962
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,650
deal with it or another network will

963
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,359
come in and start competing and figure

964
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:56,280
out a way to do a cheaper and the whole

965
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,310
environment becomes more healthy at that

966
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,930
point but to just say everybody needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

967
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:02,190
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook and email and the two</font>

968
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,690
percent that decide they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

969
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:06,570
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

970
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,100
causing the problem that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> allow</font>

971
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:10,440
for growth that doesn't spur innovation

972
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:13,290
that doesn't allow the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet to grow</font>

973
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,810
the wireless operators are stifling

974
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:17,580
growth at that point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and yes there's an</font>

975
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:20,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">economic issue here but we need to allow</font>

976
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:22,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the entire internet community to figure</font>

977
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,510
out a way to come in and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this</font>

978
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:26,790
successful and I think that the users

979
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:28,710
need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to modify their behavior</font>

980
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:30,120
or come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cash to support it</font>

981
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,660
one of the two and we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

982
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,970
that information

983
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,069
and if the information as your bill is

984
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,549
twelve thousand dollars a month that

985
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:42,410
will likely change their behavior so

986
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:47,070
that's my two cents<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next question</font>

amount for having the device on the

00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:56,640
too happy to move my traffic off of your

off of your wireless network where it's

1037

<font color="#CCCCCC">the the unlimited plans don't work the</font>

way that you perhaps think they do thank

1041
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,759
speaking for myself I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to go</font>

1042
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:19,140
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the airplane analogy cuz I don't</font>

1043
00:43:17,759 --> 00:43:20,549
think it's actually the case that you've

got a frequent<font color="#CCCCCC"> flier is taking up all</font>

1045
00:43:20,549 --> 00:43:25,619
the space I think you have an airline

1046
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:27,629
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> allowing its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flyers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring an</font>

unlimited amount of luggage on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plane</font>

1048
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:31,499
and then when somebody brings too much

1049
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:33,059
and the plane can't get off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ground</font>

1050
00:43:31,499 --> 00:43:35,098
or it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes seven hours to get from Los</font>

Angeles to San Francisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say oh</font>

1052
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:40,019
somebody abused the luggage policy

1053
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:42,390
luggage policy allows people to bring as

1054
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:45,180
much luggage as they can on the plane so

1055
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:46,200
you can eat EDD like as Rob said you

1056
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:48,660
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make something that's a little</font>

bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> richer and it's going to capture the</font>

usage patterns that people have and give

1059

them incentives to do the right thing

Kevin over<font color="#E5E5E5"> many yes net also speaking</font>

1061
00:43:59,729 --> 00:44:05,519

broadband providers are their own worst

enemies and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their marketing</font>

1064

departments and the engineering

departments don't communicate a whole

1066

lot in terms of practicalities they

1067

<font color="#E5E5E5">sprayed in particular your president</font>

exploiting that sprint unlimited is

1070
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:24,839
really unlimited he doesn't say except

1071
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,058
of course for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those who download a whole</font>

00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:28,410
bunch of stuff who were there for

00:44:26,059 --> 00:44:30,989
abusing the system he says it's

1074
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:32,430
unlimited everybody else of course says

1075
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:33,960
it's unlimited and it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't</font>

1076
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:36,569
unlimited so at least he's a bit more

1077
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,069
honest than the others all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

1078
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:40,109
unlimited plans have limits in them

1079
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:41,670
which striking<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> odd but the</font>

1080
00:44:40,109 --> 00:44:44,880
reality is as long<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're offering an</font>

1082
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:49,259
nothing abusive about people taking

00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:50,369

out<font color="#E5E5E5"> my cell phone and watch the movie</font>

1087
00:44:54,299 --> 00:44:57,059

use our unlimited bandwidth and then you

1093

say oh crud were out of bandwidth

1094
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,489
because of these abusive people that

<font color="#CCCCCC">there's got to be some correction there</font>

rational manner that takes the realities

of the market into account unlimited

data plans frankly just simply don't

make sense<font color="#CCCCCC"> rups east room again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are you</font>

00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,009
for myself and regretfully I need to

00:46:21,269 --> 00:46:25,410
take back something I thank you for

1125

earlier it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> haste to get up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

also the first ones to introduce well

ahead of our competitors what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think is</font>

closer to in a true 4G network in the

wimax the point we did with with

clearwire where we spent billions

invest many more billions of dollars

over and above our normal investment

1167
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:22,330
of do I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to better serve the</font>

ninety-eight ninety-nine percent of my

four five six gigabits per month

capacity in an individual cell site area

1173
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:43,330
or do I let all the baggage take take

1174

all the cargo hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the plane it's a</font>

address it to try to serve the

ninety-eight percent of the need so is

1178
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">there a different question or topic then</font>

at<font color="#CCCCCC"> my a line in it where'd he go fine</font>

1184
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:08,200
who do we give credit for this one to

1185
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:12,040
that industry has a long history of

1186
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:15,549
dealing with over-committing when it

1187
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:18,880
sells and the answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been</font>

1188
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:20,920
found it's called a regulation there's a

1189
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,060
penalty that every airline pays when

1190
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,579
they have to bump a passenger

1191
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,810
particularly involuntarily those rules

1192
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:27,970
have been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a long time they've</font>

1193
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:32,430
just been revised wouldn't you just love

1194
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:37,450
to see those for y'all that particularly

1195
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:40,180
so uh maybe but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> do like the idea of</font>

1196
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,578
charging by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the drink for a set of</font>

two to three<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent we are going to</font>

1199
00:49:44,589 --> 00:49:49,299
give them the choices that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> described</font>

1200
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:52,030
those exact choices that we that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we that</font>

1201
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:54,310
you described modify your behavior or

1202
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:56,050
pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it or find another provider to</font>

1203
00:49:54,310 --> 00:49:59,740
do it that is exactly what we're going

1204
00:49:56,050 --> 00:50:01,900
to do and it's you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's we're going</font>

1205
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:04,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to lose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the customer and that's that may</font>

1206
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:05,950
be the outcome of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it that's fine it's</font>

1207
00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:07,480
better in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the long run for the</font>

1208
00:50:05,950 --> 00:50:09,669
ninety-eight percent of the customers

1209
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,040
that would like access to that wireless

1210
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:15,369
number because remember what's in the

1211
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:17,950
air is shared it's not dedicated to

1212
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:20,829
given user it needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available for</font>

1213
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:23,140
as many users as possible and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">being criticized for offering unlimited</font>

00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:30,730
plans that are unlimited within some

1216
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:33,819
realistic boundary way off to the

1217
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:35,079
outlying area then<font color="#CCCCCC"> so be it because it's</font>

1218
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:37,060
still a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better plan and you're going to</font>

1219
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:40,150
find other way elsewhere in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the industry</font>

1220
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:43,060
and you know again from an innovation

1221
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:47,170
perspective two years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> we launched</font>

the wimax network a wife a what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1223
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:51,460
is a we can have<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a separate</font>

1224
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:54,069
debate what's a true 4G network and

1225
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:57,280
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but it is a lower latency</font>

1226
00:50:54,069 --> 00:51:00,520
low latency mobile IP network that we

1227
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:03,400
deployed taking the risk ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1228
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:07,200
industry and probably motivating other

00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:10,780
companies to follow

1230
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,189
yes sir I'm we're going to we're at a

1231
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:16,000
time now so we're going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cut</font>

off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the questions thank you Bob very</font>
