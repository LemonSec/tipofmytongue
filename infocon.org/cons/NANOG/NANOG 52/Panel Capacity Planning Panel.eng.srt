morning everyone this panel is on

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:10,430
capacity planning and first and foremost

3
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:12,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I wanted to attack Thank nienaber Jason</font>

00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,320
for actually doing all the work behind

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,509
the scenes to pull it all together she

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:20,899
did did the coordination and you know

7
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:23,300
Phil Kristen from caradin and also Tim

8
00:00:20,899 --> 00:00:25,309
who from wandl were responsible for

00:00:25,309 --> 00:00:29,630
thanks to them and their four panelists

11
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:32,210
we have the format of the final is we're

12
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,370
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a quick presentation by</font>

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,919
how they're using capacity planning in

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:44,539
their networks and how they found value

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,249
in using planning tools for some of the

19
00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:47,899
tasks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've been working with and</font>

20
00:00:46,249 --> 00:00:49,489
then shortly<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that we'll take</font>

21
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:51,890
questions from the panel and we also

22
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:55,159
have with us Armand Marku lay of<font color="#E5E5E5"> caravan</font>

24
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,129
who are the two planning tool vendors

25
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,620
that are going to be featured in the two

26
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:04,039
talks and you know we'd love to get

27
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,750
audience feedback and inputs on details

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,850
of how capacity planning is being used

29
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,220
and the purpose of course is to provide

30
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,869
some examples and best practice

31
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,630
knowledge that hopefully people in the

32
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,910
audience and those watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> remotely can</font>

33
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,649
take away in terms of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

34
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,300
use capacity planning and planning tools

35
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,090
in their own networks so I'll get

36
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:27,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">started by the Duke Fisher Thank You</font>

visha as he said I'm Duke Fisher I work

38
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:34,010
for Verizon I lead a team<font color="#CCCCCC"> of engineers</font>

39
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,440
and Verizon that our focus are really

40
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,870
truly our passion in the capacity

00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">planning umbrella is traffic engineering</font>

42
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:45,770
principles and we use those obviously

43
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,240
the capacity play<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the networks let me</font>

44
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,449
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with some questions for you</font>

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,500
for the audience to kind of answer I you

46
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:53,870
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to necessarily answer out</font>

47
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,210
loud but do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> care how your networks</font>

48
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,650
are out<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic I mean is that something</font>

49
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:00,619
you actually care about is that's

50
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,530
something that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you you're</font>

51
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,820
interacting your job every<font color="#CCCCCC"> day is</font>

52
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:07,160
performance your customers receives

53
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:10,160
important to you do you care what your

54
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,290
customers experience when they utilize

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,140
your network our package drops are high

56
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,920
latency acceptable then basic

57
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,179
fundamentals

58
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,859
of network capacity planning affect you

59
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:24,590
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my passion that's what I do</font>

60
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,239
everyday in my job and hopefully me and

61
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,910
Tom will share a little bit about what

62
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,350
we do every day and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> share some</font>

63
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:37,010
ideas back and forth now capacity plan

64
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:39,590
is a huge topic right it can go from the

65
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,560
individual router on what power it needs

66
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:46,940
what space it needs planning the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ports</font>

67
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,920
what ports you need to capacity planning

68
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code the traffic that goes through</font>

69
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,238
<font color="#CCCCCC">the network can my trunks handle there's</font>

70
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,910
traffic what will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> during a</font>

71
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,700
failure capacity billion is a huge topic

72
00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:00,290
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try and narrow it down kind</font>

73
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:02,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">of to what my passion is and what I do</font>

74
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,269
in that the traffic performance on the

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">network I'm going to kind of just cover</font>

76
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:09,950
two things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know I do in my job</font>

77
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,989
every day is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're gonna you know</font>

78
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,250
cover basic failure I mean everyone has

79
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:16,190
to deal with failure<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their network</font>

80
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:18,340
one way or another and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also what if</font>

81
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:21,049
scenarios what happens when I change

82
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,420
admin costs what happens if i add a

83
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,920
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol to buy network so let</font>

84
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">me go over those briefly first is the</font>

85
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,828
failure scenario you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is common</font>

86
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:34,130
this is not something new here we all

87
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:36,470
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal with this what happens when</font>

88
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">a link or a trunk goes down on my</font>

89
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,410
network or even what happens when an

90
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,470
entire router goes down on my network

91
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:47,000
how does my network react to it where

92
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:50,209
does the traffic go you know a is really

93
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessary especially in my job is really</font>

94
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessary to help me figure that out you</font>

95
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you can have an outage on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> East</font>

96
00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">Coast that's going to affect routing on</font>

97
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,440
the west coast you know if you don't

98
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,420
have a tool if you don't have a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

99
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out where your traffic flows and</font>

100
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,010
what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> during that outage</font>

101
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:11,780
well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have really only one</font>

102
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,388
choice and that's after you have to over

103
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,370
engineer it you have to you know through

104
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,470
experience you kind of figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a</font>

105
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:20,539
feel for where your traffic's going and

106
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,850
then you make your best guess you guess

107
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:25,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay i'll add capacity here to this link</font>

108
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll maybe add another router here but</font>

109
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,179
reality is you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know so you</font>

110
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,430
have to spend more money than is really

111
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,890
nice

112
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,380
cessary and that's where a tool the tool

113
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">I use is wandl that's where our tools</font>

114
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,469
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to come into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> play</font>

115
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,270
because it's going to help you save

116
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:41,190
money because you only put capacity

117
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,210
where you need it when you need it and

118
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:47,880
not have to over and over engineer it

119
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,430
just a real simple graphic you know

120
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,890
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> doral during stable state during</font>

121
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,000
normal routing times your traffic like

122
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:55,800
they're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top is going to route</font>

123
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,990
where it needs to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully on the</font>

124
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,660
shortest route you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know hopefully Shores</font>

125
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,220
latency a lot of times latency is always

126
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,990
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to paint on your traffic mix</font>

127
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,730
and what you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with it but what</font>

128
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:07,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens when that link goes down you</font>

129
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,660
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this simple drawing here you see</font>

130
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,090
it reroutes down through there now all

131
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:14,100
this comes from my tool my tool the one

132
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,260
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wando tool i use tells me all this</font>

133
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,210
without that tool you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

134
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,219
lot of routers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got a lot a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

135
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:23,099
trunks up there and there's no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd</font>

136
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,100
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out where that traffic</font>

00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,540
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where these tools can really</font>

139
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:33,390
come in good use and this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite</font>

140
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,090
ones what is scenario you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that the</font>

141
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,590
failure stuff is yo your<font color="#E5E5E5"> day to day your</font>

142
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:40,049
monthly<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that's what you have to</font>

143
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:42,859
do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where you really can have</font>

144
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,900
fun with your network if you have a tool

145
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,380
if you can dream it a tool can help you

146
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:53,340
see it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take a quick</font>

147
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:57,090
survey y'all don't mind who is running

148
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:59,880
mpls on their network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Oh a lot more</font>

149
00:05:57,090 --> 00:06:04,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I expected very good on that mpls</font>

150
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:07,320
who's running fast rewrap okay very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

151
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:11,280
you know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe have not</font>

152
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,450
ventured into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world of mpls mostly</font>

153
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,500
maybe because it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

154
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:20,190
unknown a tool can help you understand

155
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,170
how mpls works in your network so you

156
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,900
can load your network into a tool and

157
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,750
you can say okay I'm running say just is

158
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:30,840
is right now or ospf what would happen

159
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:33,300
if i add mpls how can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i use it what if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

160
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,010
decide with my mpls to color my trunks

161
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,350
or weds maybe also called admin groups

162
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:39,330
with the tool you can do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> these what</font>

163
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:40,940
if scenarios in a nice safe environment

164
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,630
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll accurately</font>

165
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:46,400
predict what will happen to your network

166
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,110
one thing a tool is really good it's

167
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,820
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take into account the type of</font>

168
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,320
routers you have your router vendor is

169
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:55,030
going to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into account what</font>

170
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">protocols you're running ospf is is vgp</font>

171
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,599
it's going to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> into effect if you're</font>

172
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:02,420
utilizing traffic engineering extensions

173
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,720
such as bandwidth where LSPs it's going

174
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:07,160
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all those into account and</font>

175
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,510
accurately predict what will happen to

176
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,910
your traffic where it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> flow</font>

177
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:14,289
and so it creates a sandbox scenario it

178
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:16,520
can be actually kind of fun to play with

179
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,730
let me give you an example of a what if

180
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,520
scenario I'm actually doing right now in

181
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:26,000
verizon oh we have two networks if you

182
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:29,750
will one's a big<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network both are global</font>

183
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,090
big<font color="#CCCCCC"> network has a large the first</font>

184
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,450
network network a is a large network 900

185
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:38,150
routers its global really big Network<font color="#E5E5E5"> B</font>

186
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,680
is also global but it's a smaller has

187
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">less</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number of routers but it has big</font>

188
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,490
trunks right<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking you know 10 gig and</font>

189
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:49,610
40 OC 768 and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just added a</font>

190
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:52,580
hundred giggy's in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe on it the goal</font>

191
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:54,169
is we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I GP merge leaves the</font>

192
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,250
run in two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> I GPS right now the</font>

193
00:07:54,169 --> 00:08:01,219
both running ospf let me go ahead and

194
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:04,010
flip so the bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> network network a is</font>

195
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the big network 900 routers global</font>

196
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:10,159
really big it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> running an ospf now it's</font>

197
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:13,070
ospf<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost skiing is based on late excuse</font>

198
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,110
me based on airline miles so when we

199
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:17,230
sign ospf<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs to a particular link</font>

200
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,510
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just using the airline miles</font>

201
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:23,570
distance to determine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network be</font>

202
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:27,020
however<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's ospf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost game is based on</font>

203
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,610
route miles or latency to be exact when

204
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:30,770
we turn up<font color="#E5E5E5"> a trunk we understand the</font>

205
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,800
exact latency that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it has when we set</font>

206
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,838
the ospf accordingly well we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to igp</font>

207
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:39,069
merge these two so so combining scared

208
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:43,969
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three right so they have one ospf</font>

209
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:45,980
the problem is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> network a is airline</font>

210
00:08:43,969 --> 00:08:49,430
miles base<font color="#CCCCCC"> its ospf cost is going to be</font>

211
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,290
inherently lower the network be now<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

212
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,599
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> is network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> B is the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font>

213
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:54,500
all the big trunks and actually already

214
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,840
has its own

215
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,780
click on it if we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just I GP</font>

216
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,000
merges together about doing anything

217
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,430
most of the traffic from network be is

218
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go down into network a which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

219
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,339
exact opposite of<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we weren't going</font>

220
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,350
to happen if that would happen we're

221
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,140
going to blow network a out trunks are

222
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,290
going to blow up so we use the tool over

223
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,350
many many models to change our ospf

224
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,110
costs on network<font color="#E5E5E5"> a to be latency based</font>

225
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,460
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're talking you know 250-300</font>

226
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,830
trunks or we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change the ospf</font>

227
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost on it's huge there's no way you</font>

228
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:28,160
could do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> without the tool but I'm</font>

229
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,500
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in my what if scenario and</font>

230
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,610
I can change my ospf cost the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

231
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:34,100
going to tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> where my traffic</font>

232
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,720
routing what the latency is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

233
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,970
any changes that I like or don't like

234
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,790
and then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> can tweak the ospf cost to</font>

235
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,000
make it where go where I want to go so

236
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:46,189
that's a what-if example I hopefully

237
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,690
didn't take up too much time Tom's going

238
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:56,120
to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> next and then we'll answer</font>

239
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:59,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions afterwards Tom Tom go first ok</font>

240
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,490
let's do so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll bring up next Tom</font>

241
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:02,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">lundström of quest and then you know</font>

242
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:05,620
right after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take questions</font>

243
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,620
for both Tom and

244
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:21,459
sorry

245
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:24,490
no well good morning everyone my name is

246
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lundström I'm with quest some folks</font>

247
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:31,060
might be aware that quest was recently

248
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:34,449
acquired by CenturyLink our headquarters

249
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:38,138
have moved from Denver to Montreux

250
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:42,519
Louisiana and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have an official name</font>

251
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:45,790
change campaign in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the August time frame</font>

252
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:51,279
to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name so the talk today</font>

253
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:52,510
is on capacity planning and my hope is

254
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,839
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you a feel for some of the</font>

255
00:10:52,510 --> 00:11:00,790
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're doing at a service</font>

256
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">provider level by way of introduction I</font>

257
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:08,769
wanted to share<font color="#CCCCCC"> with you two slides the</font>

258
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:12,160
first is an overview<font color="#CCCCCC"> of who Quest is if</font>

259
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:15,279
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not familiar with quest our</font>

260
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,490
infrastructure includes a large fiber

261
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,250
backbone we have all the services that

262
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,279
you might expect we have 15 million

263
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:27,339
access lines and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> million broadband</font>

264
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:32,019
customers so I did a check a few days

265
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:35,800
ago and we have about 13,000 routers

266
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:38,620
that I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to locate in a database</font>

267
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have the part of that you know</font>

268
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:45,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that consists of a metro ethernet</font>

269
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,839
broadband<font color="#E5E5E5"> network of VPN bunch of boy</font>

270
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:50,350
stuff that we're doing the part of the

271
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:53,519
network that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a member of a team</font>

272
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:56,889
that manages is the IP backbone and

273
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:01,839
we're present in 60 cities we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

274
00:11:56,889 --> 00:12:04,149
120 core routers 630 edge facing routers

275
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,880
and so there's about a thousand routers

276
00:12:04,149 --> 00:12:09,430
in that network that we help manage and

277
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,519
our link sizes are in the range of 40

278
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:15,760
gig to 120 gig in size so that gives you

279
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:19,630
a feel for for some of the work that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

280
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,120
do so my second slide is extremely

281
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:25,680
fascinating but I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

282
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,120
give a feel for the perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

283
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,579
which were<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be talking today so</font>

284
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,040
planning can be handled in probably in

285
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,550
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience in various groups for some</font>

286
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,050
it's a finance or a budgeting exercise

287
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:43,920
for others it might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> function that's</font>

288
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:46,370
performed in a knock and for others you

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">may have a department that handles</font>

a three to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five-year strategic concern</font>

295
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:08,310
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit deeper</font>

296
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:11,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">here now so our team's mission some of</font>

the goals that we shoot<font color="#E5E5E5"> for number one</font>

298
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,400
we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and write route every packet</font>

299

been<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to try and survive any</font>

302
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,280
failure and we look at about 500 of

303
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:32,610
those with no congestion and then number

304
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:36,120
three we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked to meet all of</font>

305
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:39,810
our customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> service level agreements so</font>

306
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,370
that's pretty obvious and and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

307
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,839
thing we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been tasked with is to do</font>

308
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:48,540
all this good stuff it at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lowest</font>

309
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:50,610
cost so this next<font color="#E5E5E5"> set of slides gets</font>

310
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,000
into some of the planning structures and

311
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:55,740
tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have in place and this</font>

312
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,520
slide here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll present three layers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

313
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:06,090
tools this is our data layer we use to

314
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:08,340
open source databases psql<font color="#E5E5E5"> postgres it's</font>

315
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:11,070
designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle daily snapshots of</font>

316
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:15,720
infrastructure for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

317
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:17,610
lists of routers list of interfaces<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

318
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:20,670
adjacencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp session information</font>

319
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:23,940
stuff like that the second open source

320
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:26,969
database is<font color="#CCCCCC"> round-robin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> database and</font>

321
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:30,510
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to handle the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five-minute</font>

322
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:31,680
data so cpu utilization traffic stats on

323
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,620
interfaces in LSP

324
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,709
these stuff like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously from our</font>

325
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:41,040
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have an interest in the</font>

326
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,990
traffic component of our rrd database so

327
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,810
our second layer here is our toolkit and

328
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:48,180
we have an in-house forecasting process

329
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:51,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's developed over time we have a</font>

330
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,020
homegrown simulation engine and we have

331
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:56,819
a set of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python utilities</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we use</font>

332
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:59,520
the other half<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our toolkit then is</font>

333
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:02,550
vendor purchased and we used we use

334
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,260
keratins mate product which consists of

335
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:06,060
three components there's an archive

336
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,730
which takes a snapshot of the network

337
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:10,739
every two hours there's a simulation

338
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,130
engine and a GUI that helps us visualize

339
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:17,430
what's happening in the network so

340
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:18,990
you'll notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> a component here that's</font>

341
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:23,819
homegrown that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I added</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the vendor</font>

342
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:27,180
side of the equation excuse me that the

343
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,010
problem with purchasing from a vendor is

344
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,469
that you get yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this</font>

345
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:33,660
situation the scenario goes like this

346
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,459
you know you you purchase the product

347
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,810
and with the short amount of time you

348
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:40,979
realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the product that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

349
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:43,619
purchased doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly meet you know</font>

350
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,170
what what you intend to do so keratins

351
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:50,370
developed this function called an add-on

352
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:52,949
and that allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to to essentially use</font>

353
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:56,760
the toolkit for what it was intended to

354
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:59,279
do and augment it with Perl and Python

355
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:03,959
scripts simple Perl and Python scripts

356
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:07,370
for those cases that we we need to you

357
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:10,739
know add further development to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tool</font>

358
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,630
so if everything works right if our<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

359
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,339
is right our tools are good then that

360
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:17,070
informs our third layer which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

361
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:22,230
people layer folks in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our planning and</font>

362
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:24,120
to some extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> our operations groups so</font>

363
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,010
that was kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary of high-level</font>

364
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">summary of some of the databases and</font>

365
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:32,189
tools that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we use this next section here</font>

366
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,740
it talks about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the specific</font>

367
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,149
components that are required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to simulate</font>

368
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,130
to you know to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a live network and</font>

369
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:41,010
put it in an offline or a simulation

370
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,370
type environment and its really

371
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:44,080
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would</font>

372
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:46,089
fact you know you need a list of routers

373
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,870
you need a list of circuits with

374
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:51,940
capacities and metrics you need a sense

375
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:55,390
for traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be on the network</font>

376
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:58,570
in the future and you need to have a

377
00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:02,589
list of SLR GS and just a quick

378
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:05,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">refresher on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SL RGS I SLR G's or shared</font>

380
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,709
that share a common physical

381
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,490
vulnerability<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example you know a</font>

382
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,709
circuit a set of circuits that are

383
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:17,800
provisioned through a particular conduit

384
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:21,040
when that conduit gets back code that

385
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,059
set of circuits goes down or a set of

386
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,428
circuits that are provisioned to a

387
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:28,030
router that router goes belly-up and

388
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:29,890
that set of circuits goes down here's a

389
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,300
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> that get our blood pressure up this</font>

390
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,910
is a train derailment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened</font>

391
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:36,450
about 60 or 70 miles west of<font color="#CCCCCC"> here over</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">birthday pass my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> understanding</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

393
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,679
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this experience is that train</font>

394
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,600
derailments that happen inside of

395
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,100
tunnels are especially difficult and

396
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:51,550
lengthy to clean up this is a hurricane

397
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Allison that's not the floor that's</font>

398
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:57,309
actually a stream flowing through there

399
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:59,110
and this is a wildfire here not too long

400
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,660
ago in Texas<font color="#CCCCCC"> that took the roof off of</font>

401
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:04,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of our repeater sites thus we lost a</font>

402
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:07,270
set of circuits that ran through there

403
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,100
so we talked a little bit about the

404
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:12,970
components<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are required to set up</font>

the model<font color="#E5E5E5"> one components that is that's</font>

406
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:17,290
especially important is the demand

407
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,840
forecasting and I think demand

408
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,370
forecasting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a talk all in itself but</font>

409
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,230
I did want to mention a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

410
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:30,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">that at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quest we we deploy several</font>

411
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:33,520
layers of full mpls meshes which makes

412
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,700
measuring historic traffic flow rather

413
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,980
easy we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an explicit set of data</font>

414
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:42,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">that tells us the distribution of</font>

415
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:46,570
traffic across the back one so the other

416
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:50,470
important component here is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of</font>

417
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:53,439
tuning so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that it's fairly</font>

418
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,040
easy to get a sense of what traffic is

419
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,740
flowing across your network

420
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,379
at a network level but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

421
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:01,460
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drill down into that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

422
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,430
little bit and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

423
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,430
network story or the growth story makes

424
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:10,670
sense it at other levels to for example

425
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:12,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know how much a particular site</font>

426
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,350
might be offering to the backbone or

427
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,390
taking off the backbone what services

428
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:19,580
are growing within a site<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can</font>

429
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">get further on down than that so we've</font>

430
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,840
developed a set of tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that help us</font>

431
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:28,430
visualize and ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the forecast</font>

432
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:30,080
is right on so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> spot on ok so</font>

433
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:31,550
we've got the model set up we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

it the next step is modeling and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

436
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:41,149
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a process of examining the SLR</font>

437
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">geez that we've set up we do that</font>

438
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:48,710
exhaustively and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

442
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:00,410
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what you'd expect we get a</font>

list of circuit circuit augmentations

00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:05,990
that need to happen and we get a list of

445
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:09,230
or a sense of costs for that and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

446
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:11,840
know then what hardware platforms will

449
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:22,159
like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so that's that's sort of</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> structure the next set of slides i</font>

00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,140
responsibilities we have an annual

457
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:44,510
planning cycle comes up with a list of

458
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,550
circuits that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add and we</font>

459
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,160
update that quarterly sometimes more

460
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:52,340
often if we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to the second</font>

bullet occasionally<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of the tools</font>

463
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:01,939
peers and operations and look at some

464
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:03,680
reason for outage type studies and the

465
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,130
third group though<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is really</font>

466
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,020
what I find very interesting

467
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,840
sting and I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drill into these</font>

468
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,340
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit further I've listed for but</font>

469
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,370
I'm actually going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to only drill into</font>

470
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the first two so we did this study</font>

471
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:20,399
recently where we took a group<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

472
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,010
network topologies that looked

473
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,260
interesting and looked<font color="#CCCCCC"> like they might</font>

474
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:27,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">be something we you know that would help</font>

475
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,920
us out and then we looked at a list at a

476
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,440
set of igp metric schemes that look like

477
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:37,850
they held some promise and we when we

478
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,780
combine those together we had a set of

479
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:42,030
combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different things that we</font>

480
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,910
looked at and and the chart here that

481
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:47,879
you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the y axis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is cost and</font>

482
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:49,680
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> average latency so as you</font>

483
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">go up you get more expensive and as you</font>

484
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,710
go to the right your<font color="#E5E5E5"> network becomes</font>

485
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,909
slower average latency increases and

486
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:02,750
what we found is what you'd expect

487
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:05,490
there's a set of schemes that produce

488
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:08,460
very fast networks but they're also very

489
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">expensive those are on the top left</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

490
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:16,170
then on the bottom right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a group</font>

491
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:18,810
of networks that that are cost efficient

492
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,610
but they're extremely slow so the cool

493
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:22,800
thing apart about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this study was that we</font>

494
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:26,490
found<font color="#CCCCCC"> a combination and we built</font>

495
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:29,909
ourselves a narrative of what really

496
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:33,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">fast but really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost effective networks</font>

497
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:36,660
look like and we use those for guiding

498
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:40,020
than future planning cycles so we

499
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:41,940
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of fun second</font>

500
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,590
second study that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drill into a</font>

501
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit is this concept of fan out</font>

502
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,990
and that is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that we</font>

503
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,750
discovered here at nanog a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> times</font>

504
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,600
back so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind this chart is</font>

505
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:57,750
that on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis we have 24 hour</font>

506
00:22:54,600 --> 00:23:01,620
period<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what we've graphed here is a</font>

507
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:03,990
single flow from one interface out to

508
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,300
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> point in our network and the solid</font>

509
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:09,800
line represents the the usual traffic

510
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:12,990
flow that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see you have the the</font>

511
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:15,360
nighttime valley and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> daytime peak</font>

512
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,520
and that's all fine and well and

513
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,129
expected what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really neat thing is</font>

514
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,720
that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the dashed line that</font>

515
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:26,790
represents the percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> total</font>

516
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,340
traffic on the link that this flow

517
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:31,710
represents and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really common for us</font>

518
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,980
to see that percentage be very

519
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,570
consistent in this case that percentage

520
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,800
is right around thirty to forty percent

521
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,310
it hangs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thirty five percent</font>

522
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,570
range and that's kind of neat and we

523
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,639
think it's useful in the planning

524
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:50,070
process so i won't get into that much

525
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:55,020
further<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have two more slides evolution</font>

526
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:57,360
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the topic i think when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we first</font>

527
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">started this challenge six or seven or</font>

528
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:03,360
eight or nine years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we found that we</font>

529
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:05,370
had a boatload of really good

530
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,379
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was trying</font>

531
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:10,229
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get something useful out of that and</font>

532
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:12,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think three things really contributed</font>

533
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:16,470
to that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found ourselves with a pretty</font>

534
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:18,389
diverse skill set we've got some folks

535
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:20,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">in our operations group who know how to</font>

536
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,050
store the data and make it easy to

537
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,520
access and then we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

538
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:25,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who know how to mine it out of</font>

539
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,420
there we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to steal somebody</font>

540
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:31,740
from our operations group who keeps us

541
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:33,929
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> grounded in things that are</font>

542
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,760
practical it keeps us out of typical

543
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:38,670
planning areas that tend towards the

544
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,790
crazy side we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

545
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:43,679
mathematicians and a programmer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

546
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:45,928
helps us solve some of the really hard

547
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,990
problems and then we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

548
00:24:45,929 --> 00:24:50,310
folks that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have stepped up to the</font>

549
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,020
modeling exercise and it become kind of

550
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,020
experts in working with the vendor tools

551
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,630
second bullet we have a good

552
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">relationship with our vendor to help</font>

553
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:03,929
explore some<font color="#E5E5E5"> some new and different</font>

554
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:07,610
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bullet is this</font>

555
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:10,980
concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know repetition so you</font>

556
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:14,399
you do a study and then you validate it

557
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:15,960
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might build a tool and then</font>

558
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,580
you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> again and you do another study</font>

559
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,190
and validate it you might improve your

560
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:21,169
tools and I think that process over a

561
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,780
year's time

562
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:27,200
I has really helped us you know produce

563
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:30,230
what we think is some some good work so

564
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,840
the the final<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of a revolution story</font>

565
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,780
might be sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the pure</font>

566
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,820
you know capacity planning role and

567
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:42,260
beginning to offer insights to the

568
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:45,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">business and on a good day even</font>

569
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:49,600
informing decisions and influencing or

570
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:52,780
at least informing strategy and policy

571
00:25:49,600 --> 00:26:04,040
so thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much and I think will</font>

572
00:25:52,780 --> 00:26:06,020
hand it off to you Michelle so thanks

573
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,730
Dom man and Duke so right now what we'd

574
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:10,790
like to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is open it up to the audience</font>

575
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:12,380
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions and they can be generic on</font>

576
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,270
you know aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the presentation</font>

577
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might want more clarification</font>

578
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:20,030
on or related more generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

579
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,800
planning process and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know the</font>

580
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,320
questions can be too specific panelists

581
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:26,300
or just to the panel as a whole and then

582
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,389
we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take as many of those as</font>

583
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,129
we can so you know I of course like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

584
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,960
open it up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> house and see if</font>

585
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,510
there's any questions coming from there

586
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,370
otherwise there might be some things

587
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:43,070
this I've made note of glenn reynolds of

588
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:45,260
mediacom do when you did your background

589
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,939
into that for the links and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then going</font>

590
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:49,010
down did you also take into

591
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,410
consideration the cellular backhaul

592
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:55,310
that's being done through most of the

593
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:58,180
cable companies now is this song yeah

594
00:26:55,310 --> 00:27:01,370
Sally Rebecca you know I'm not

595
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:02,990
differentiating between traffic types

596
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,129
are you asking about traffic types going

597
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,260
across the network or you asked about

598
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">the access into the network well when</font>

599
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">you were talking about a link failing on</font>

600
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:12,020
it and the switching over did you also

601
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,870
take into consideration the backhaul

602
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:18,530
part of it that may fail forcing a link

603
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:21,409
within a different company like Comcast

604
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:25,639
or media com yeah so you know you know

605
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,820
I'm lucky in that I i own the fiber that

606
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm on</font>

607
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:32,470
I'm verizon you know so I have a large

608
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:35,980
fiber backbone but what you're getting

609
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:39,210
at is what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tomlin sharing shared risk</font>

610
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,009
link groups you've got to know obviously

611
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,600
where your trunks or links I don't know

612
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:46,080
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you call them where they route you</font>

613
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">know on what carrier and in particular</font>

614
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,039
where their vulnerabilities are so if

615
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,679
you have your trunks going across

616
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,980
different carriers you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones by</font>

617
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,440
comcast another by another carrier you

618
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:01,450
know can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know where those wear your</font>

619
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,340
wear those single points of failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> czar</font>

620
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,840
and so the what you do is you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

621
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,360
and you can put those into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model and</font>

622
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,789
you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I k this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> single this single</font>

623
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:13,508
point goes down say it's a you know a

624
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:16,090
splice point or a railway taking out a

625
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:17,710
whole tunnel how many trunks are going

626
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:19,149
to go down so you tell the model okay

627
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:21,070
trunk one two and three you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

628
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:22,989
go down and then the model will then

629
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:24,189
tell you okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that traffic was going</font>

630
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:26,049
through trunks one two three are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

631
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:28,059
to read avert to these areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

632
00:28:26,049 --> 00:28:29,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the question you're asking well</font>

633
00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:31,690
yeah the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason the reason i was asking</font>

634
00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:34,779
that is I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just signed contracts</font>

635
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:39,100
with verizon to backhaul over 300 towers

636
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:42,279
as well as with US cellular and quest to

637
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,439
backhaul another 300 towers and you know

638
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:46,570
if your model is has some flaws in that

639
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,940
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at wandl a little</font>

640
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:51,700
closer for our operations group since

641
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,899
i'm the senior manager there but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font>

642
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,580
wonder if<font color="#E5E5E5"> those were also taken into</font>

643
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,830
consideration yeah absolutely you know

644
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:59,230
trash in trash out you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

645
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's that's where you've got to hit up</font>

646
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:04,090
verizon<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us west and say where are</font>

647
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,830
you routing this and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can plug</font>

648
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,269
that into the model and that's what's

649
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:10,029
great about the model is it's totally

650
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:11,710
flexible so you you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the</font>

651
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:13,179
model in wandl it's called a facility

652
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,210
file I don't know what it's called

653
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:19,000
keratin but and you tell that facility

654
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:22,059
file this failure analysis for this

655
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,250
failure analysis i want trunks 1568<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

656
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:26,559
go down because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verizon and</font>

657
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:29,080
us Wes are sharing a fiber conduit there

658
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,639
and that's a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of failure so</font>

659
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,590
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's great about the fools is</font>

660
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:35,199
there they're very they're very flexible

661
00:29:32,590 --> 00:29:44,620
thank you yes sir

662
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:48,429
yeah sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Armand this might well thank</font>

663
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:50,768
you Duke's perspectives what we find

664
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:54,460
elsewhere too is that the core backbone

665
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:57,909
group tends to be serviced agnostic so

666
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,279
within verizon within most the telcos

667
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:02,399
there is a IP backbone group that

668
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:06,639
service agnostic and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their service</font>

669
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:08,768
groups that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of very specific</font>

670
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:11,500
mobile backhaul sales that they have

671
00:30:08,769 --> 00:30:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">made and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the planning is takes</font>

672
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,289
place in both of those the family

673
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,899
planning takes place in both of those

674
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:20,649
groups so somebody like Duke and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom</font>

675
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:23,080
make sure that as far<font color="#E5E5E5"> as aggregate</font>

676
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:25,389
traffic is concerned your traffic is

677
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,250
safe there is yet another group because

678
00:30:25,389 --> 00:30:29,949
your mobile backhaul often will go

679
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:33,870
through an edge network or a regional

680
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:36,070
network that is outside<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the domain is</font>

681
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:38,590
possibly goes through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that air then goes</font>

682
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,799
out to another edge network and for your

683
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:43,899
service to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> well planned and assured</font>

684
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,990
there's another group whom we are

685
00:30:43,899 --> 00:30:50,830
usually help that has to have a view of

686
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:53,200
the edge networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view where your</font>

687
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:55,658
service is actually defined and help

688
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,570
from the backbone and it's those folks

689
00:30:55,659 --> 00:31:01,059
who will say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the one of those</font>

690
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:02,710
300 may be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble or not and that</font>

691
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:04,750
division tends<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work pretty well and</font>

692
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,820
you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know the</font>

693
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,620
backbone folks really cannot keep track

694
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,200
of the millions and millions of services

695
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,689
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist and then the service folks</font>

696
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,860
really cannot be keeping track<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

697
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:20,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">backbone on a day-to-day basis does that</font>

698
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,389
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question so just to summarize</font>

699
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,860
I think what they said is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Armand</font>

700
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,178
said is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this two different groups that</font>

701
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,309
are handling<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and a group that's</font>

702
00:31:25,179 --> 00:31:29,350
offering the services would have a view

703
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:32,019
of specifically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the backhaul I think</font>

704
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,309
what you can and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tom said was that when</font>

705
00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:34,840
you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the operators you're</font>

706
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:36,668
buying capacity from you need some

707
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,350
knowledge about what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

708
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:41,049
the traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plug into</font>

709
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:42,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully you're planning tool and get a</font>

710
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:44,260
sense independently or what the

711
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,090
operators might tell you about what's

712
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,889
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen should something fail so</font>

713
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">that both of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those will together provide</font>

714
00:31:47,889 --> 00:31:50,590
the

715
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,110
security I guess you're looking at in

716
00:31:50,590 --> 00:32:02,290
terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> backhaul traffic right so</font>

717
00:31:53,110 --> 00:32:05,290
other questions from the audience so I

718
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:06,909
have a question for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience of</font>

719
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,580
those you out there that I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

720
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,960
know who would do something like this in

721
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,980
capacity planning for those you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought to</font>

722
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:16,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">do you currently use a tool actually</font>

723
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,560
that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> good one so home how many</font>

724
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:19,300
people are actually using a planning

725
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,669
tool of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people who said they have</font>

726
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,129
mpls networks how many are<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

727
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:29,130
using formalized planning tools for

728
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:31,840
their planning process<font color="#E5E5E5"> one two three</font>

729
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,300
that that seems like I would say it's

730
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,220
like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I less</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than less than ten</font>

731
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:38,770
percent yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm so my next question</font>

732
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,900
is for those of you that are in charge

733
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:44,889
of capacity planning and don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

734
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:47,140
tool I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you just are you just</font>

735
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:49,690
are you just over engineering it

736
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:55,000
spending more money and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to or</font>

737
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:56,350
have you done an in-house tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> Excel you</font>

738
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,350
know and I'm glad you said that because

739
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:02,500
I mean Excel spreadsheets right it's

740
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:03,879
insane it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely insane you know</font>

741
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,480
it's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I absolutely love</font>

742
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:09,010
about a tool is I load it in there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

743
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a graphical display my network</font>

744
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:15,550
there's a big I'm a visual<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think</font>

745
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:18,040
visually and so with the tool you you

746
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,960
visually see where the network's going

747
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:23,830
where it's routing where the allergies

748
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,240
are you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really encourage it</font>

749
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,649
just because your return on investment

750
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,630
you'll have your return investment in

751
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:30,880
less than a year because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you won't have</font>

752
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:33,520
to put capacity and where you don't need

753
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,040
it you can only target exactly where you

754
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,100
need it when you need it so yeah get off

755
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:41,020
those excel spreadsheets I mean they're

756
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,490
insane so yeah so I think initially

757
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">about 30 people said they're doing I</font>

758
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:46,300
p.m. pls planning and maybe three or

759
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:47,590
four said they actually use<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tool so</font>

760
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,780
how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you I don't know how many</font>

761
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:52,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">people feel they have a network I guess</font>

762
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,680
big enough that could derive value from

763
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:56,290
having to lie mean of course if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

764
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,970
a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> network even in fairly small</font>

765
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:59,980
networks there's a lot of value that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

766
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:01,360
could arrive in my opinion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many</font>

767
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who are here would feel that</font>

768
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,990
perhaps a tool would

769
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:08,800
would benefit them would you mind

770
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:11,139
raising your hand that's one two three

771
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,850
four five<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes about ten percent of the</font>

772
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:14,980
room feels that they could perhaps

773
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:17,109
immediately use the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think the</font>

774
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,460
important point here is Excel

775
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:20,469
spreadsheets are great when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

776
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing set of you know just basic</font>

777
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,819
capacity planning but if you wanted to

778
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,220
do what if scenario planning I it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

779
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,250
very difficult i believe to do with with

780
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,540
in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> excel spreadsheet and</font>

781
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:34,659
visualization and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave and an</font>

782
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,149
arm on can probably comment on that as

783
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,619
what they are seeing as a value that

784
00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:40,449
sort of your customers are deriving from

785
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:42,100
the use of the tool I mean if you have

786
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:43,330
some comments or something that you

787
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,710
might want to eliminate the audience

788
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:52,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">about I think they'll be valuable at</font>

789
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:55,210
this point now only on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wando</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> site</font>

790
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,670
the tool on one side is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

791
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:01,270
existing network that you can simulate

792
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:04,030
if you have a set of notes links the

793
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:06,490
topologies and traffic matrix and then

794
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,190
you can simulate with or without all

795
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:11,618
kinds of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ca</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with traffic engineering</font>

796
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:14,950
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff engineering so you can do a</font>

lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what if at the network existing</font>

00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:25,869
tour is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually also useful in in many</font>

800
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:29,560
the the so-called difficult computing

801
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:31,420
cases for example if you if you

802
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,630
currently have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> terabit of traffic</font>

803
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,090
every second then for the next five

804
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:40,150
years you expect it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to 10</font>

805
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:43,000
therapists or 20 terabytes what kind of

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,710
network are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you getting into the tool</font>

807
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,210
can be used for this kind of computing

808
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:51,580
we can configure either<font color="#CCCCCC"> tanga clinks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

810
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:55,690
matter of seconds you see many many many

811
00:35:53,320 --> 00:36:00,310
different topologies and different costs

812
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:02,770
so the data is can be easily created for

813
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:06,990
a lot of what-if analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the future</font>

814
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:10,090
or if you change ospf to RSS or if you

815
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:13,209
did he get into cloud computing you get

816
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,680
into layer to computation<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

discover all your layer tool topology

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,759
all this kind of thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually part</font>

819
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,850
of the tool occasionally they'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

820
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,570
useful but most of the time the<font color="#CCCCCC"> G it all</font>

821
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:32,730
depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your problem your questions</font>

822
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:37,080
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so I'd say this is a one area</font>

823
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:39,270
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> keratin one will differ a bit the</font>

824
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:40,590
visualization is extremely important but

825
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,910
what we're finding is that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

826
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:43,650
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> of tasks that just need to be</font>

827
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,180
automated and done over and over again

828
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:47,760
and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of things that tom</font>

829
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:50,910
was mentioning with the add-on we're

830
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,710
finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is a place for doing</font>

831
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,930
what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> analysis but there's also big</font>

832
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,750
place for automating process or at least

833
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,460
streamlining them we're finding<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

834
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,230
example that a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sales folks tend</font>

835
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,870
to come to network engineers asking

836
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:05,810
about a particular big customer if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

837
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:09,330
were to add this customer would they be

838
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:11,460
accepted and it's taking up very

839
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,720
valuable time of valuable engineers

840
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,460
times for doing these sorts of things

841
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,009
that process could be and should be

842
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:19,020
automated such the tool can do that for

843
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:22,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you we're finding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

844
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,780
customers prefer to have a baseline

845
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:29,250
planning done automatically for them

846
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:30,450
just so that you at you know doing

847
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's very simple just</font>

848
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:34,680
increasing it based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the failure</font>

849
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:38,610
analysis increasing in based on set

850
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,649
amounts so that you know every week

851
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:42,060
every month you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have you can have an</font>

852
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,650
automated report that goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> through to</font>

853
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,779
your CFO that says look this is the

854
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,940
worse it could be and then you can be

855
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,470
doing the what-if analysis on top of

856
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,750
that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's important both</font>

857
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:55,589
the visualization and the automation

858
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:57,060
aspects absolutely so does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that trigger</font>

859
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:59,820
off any thoughts on the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

860
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,759
please yeah what question my name is

861
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:04,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Paul mendler with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Google but in Europe</font>

862
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,030
sorry could you introduce yourself again

863
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,280
yes we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> involve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mendel with google</font>

864
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,750
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am based in Europe so if one</font>

865
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,610
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> with regards to this what if</font>

866
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,320
scenarios will you also look into when

867
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:14,910
and where it makes sense to establish

868
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:18,210
local peering connections or even to

869
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,980
foster some local exchange point this

870
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:21,840
also self which is look being looked

871
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,280
into for example in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-4 i understand</font>

872
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:26,430
there is no exchange point traffic is

873
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,690
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and forth to whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> atlanta</font>

874
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,239
whatever i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly how it</font>

875
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:31,389
works

876
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:34,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a good example yeah we have</font>

877
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:37,329
done this peering analysis exactly what

878
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:39,459
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about for Yahoo actual</font>

879
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:42,729
yahoo is using our too powerful<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

880
00:38:39,459 --> 00:38:46,178
exactly this purpose yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think from</font>

881
00:38:42,729 --> 00:38:48,038
from West perspective is this microphone

882
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:52,869
around<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so yes i'll put italy with</font>

883
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:55,769
your arms you know that's that's a

884
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:59,439
that's actually a really important

885
00:38:55,769 --> 00:39:03,249
component of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is to try and</font>

886
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:05,319
not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand traffic flow but to</font>

887
00:39:03,249 --> 00:39:09,249
understand those components that add

888
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:11,319
cost to the network and sometimes things

889
00:39:09,249 --> 00:39:12,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are growing really rapidly don't</font>

890
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:14,589
actually add<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and</font>

891
00:39:12,879 --> 00:39:17,679
it's important to differentiate those

892
00:39:14,589 --> 00:39:22,389
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think the area that you bring up</font>

893
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:23,709
is one of those some and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dom yesterday</font>

894
00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:25,899
when in the discussion you were talking

895
00:39:23,709 --> 00:39:27,339
about also computing how what volume of

896
00:39:25,899 --> 00:39:29,469
traffic is moving in and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

897
00:39:27,339 --> 00:39:31,779
network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is presumably that</font>

898
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:34,239
would give insights into in a way of

899
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:35,739
hearing might make sense so what volumes

900
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:38,949
of traffic would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> required to be</font>

901
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:41,609
paired yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Vishal is</font>

902
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:45,039
referring<font color="#CCCCCC"> to here is this concept of</font>

903
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:47,739
getting a sense for not only what

904
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:50,619
happens inside of your network but

905
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:52,539
traffic flow across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and I</font>

906
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:53,979
think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of development work</font>

907
00:39:52,539 --> 00:39:56,289
that's that's happening in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

908
00:39:53,979 --> 00:39:58,089
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and it's probably one of the</font>

909
00:39:56,289 --> 00:40:02,079
areas that will see grow in the next few

910
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:05,169
years and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom yeah we were talking</font>

911
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:07,869
yesterday how you know doing what if

912
00:40:05,169 --> 00:40:11,019
scenarios changed a metric within your

913
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:13,869
network and it caused the traffic coming

914
00:40:11,019 --> 00:40:15,908
in from one peer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you then now go through</font>

915
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:18,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">a different pure right because you know</font>

916
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:20,160
the advertised routes on one peer

917
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:21,570
was when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed the metric than</font>

918
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,129
they came from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> advertiser outs from</font>

919
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,810
a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> pier yeah and they're paying</font>

920
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:26,370
all your contracts with that period is

921
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:28,830
that could have cost you you know some

922
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:30,930
serious money so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's where definitely</font>

923
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:33,270
I think that what if would help and

924
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:36,720
benefit a lot does I answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

925
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:40,380
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so other questions from</font>

926
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,759
the audience so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tommy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just want to go</font>

927
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,860
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to something that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said in your</font>

928
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,650
presentation which was that you needed

929
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some ad on software so one of the</font>

930
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,820
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we work may be highlighting</font>

931
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:52,140
here is can what<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of additions were</font>

932
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,330
needed and what kind of effort was

933
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:55,680
involved because there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people the</font>

934
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:57,509
audience may think well you know quest

935
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,669
has the resources to have this kind of

936
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:01,260
add on software done do we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so</font>

937
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:05,190
perhaps you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> elute and address some</font>

938
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:09,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those cells so maybe so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

939
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:11,820
is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the augmenting the tools and</font>

940
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:15,810
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll just give you a sense of what</font>

941
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:18,230
we do we develop some ad on

942
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:21,750
functionality that allows us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

943
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:24,390
essentially forklift the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP metrics out</font>

944
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:27,810
of the model and replace them with a new

945
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:31,589
set and that's something that could be

946
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:33,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> outside of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the modeling process but</font>

947
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:35,280
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really nice for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a modelers to be</font>

948
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just point and click and do that</font>

949
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,220
inside the GUI and what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> took was a</font>

950
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:44,850
it might have been three or four or five

951
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">pages of a perl script it works in</font>

952
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:53,100
conjunction with the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just makes</font>

953
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:55,919
that process easier another example

954
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:59,460
might be some evaluation add-ons that

955
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,870
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> added to the tool it gives us the</font>

956
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:05,220
ability to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know take the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worst case</font>

957
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:08,910
get a list of circuits and then maybe

958
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,950
apply some cost to it in a way that we

959
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:15,350
feel is right for whatever study<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

960
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:15,350
doing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> examples</font>

961
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:20,320
I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say the second ad on Tom</font>

962
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:22,120
said is the most popular ad on

963
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a different notion of</font>

964
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:30,130
what their cost structure is and route

965
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:32,800
miles what<font color="#CCCCCC"> discount are getting from a</font>

966
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular vendor and that that by far</font>

967
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:40,840
seems to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most popular</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ad on any</font>

968
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:43,750
other touch from the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

969
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:46,570
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the customers data</font>

970
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:50,230
conversion into the 102 is totally

971
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:54,030
automated so so so that's the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

972
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:56,320
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are driving into because we basically</font>

973
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:59,800
at the beginning we are the planning

974
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:02,500
tool but then we we found that more and

975
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:06,010
more people put a lot of effort into

976
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:09,190
creating the file we need so so we

977
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:12,520
automate that by simply reading config

978
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:15,190
files directly from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco juniper octave</font>

979
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,780
loosen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huawei so we pass this config</font>

980
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:20,140
file and then for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> five-minute</font>

981
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:22,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic we automatically collect traffic</font>

982
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:25,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">of every five minutes from the entire</font>

983
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:28,000
network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own Wrong</font>

984
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:31,540
Robin database we convert it into our

985
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,720
format so the challenge on the tool

986
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:37,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendor site is simply automation we try</font>

987
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:43,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">to automated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the network design planning</font>

988
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:47,860
process the as much as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

989
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:50,800
other thoughts so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go back</font>

990
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,200
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a both you and Tom do can you in</font>

991
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,200
terms of maybe you can illuminate a

992
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,490
little bit about you talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

993
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,589
kind of insights you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

994
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,390
derive so 11 the two parts to it one is

995
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:03,160
of course just do basic engineering

996
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:05,140
planning and architecture and that's

997
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,790
already providing value in terms of

998
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,950
cutting down time or the various

999
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:11,380
scenarios one can visualize but then the

1000
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:13,149
next step of that evolution is what you

1001
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,130
said it began to<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence sort of</font>

1002
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:17,350
business insights so I'm wondering to

1003
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,640
order to whatever extent you can you

1004
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:20,830
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you can give some sense to the</font>

1005
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,560
audience of how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of</font>

1006
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:25,180
business insights valuable and how they

1007
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:27,290
might have informed sort of more

1008
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:33,169
important economic decisions

1009
00:44:27,290 --> 00:44:36,430
it in strategy I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can take that one so</font>

1010
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:38,570
the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you know how what do we</font>

1011
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:42,259
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> in addition to kind of the</font>

1012
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:46,040
capacity planning area and I think we

1013
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:49,720
touched on this a little bit from from

1014
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:49,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the last questions here and</font>

1015
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:58,070
really I think a big area that we've

1016
00:44:54,380 --> 00:45:00,590
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to help out with is this</font>

1017
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:03,020
concept of you know things are

1018
00:45:00,590 --> 00:45:06,320
definitely growing on the network but

1019
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:11,530
not everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that grows has a cost</font>

1020
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,530
associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there's a things like</font>

1021
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:16,640
non-concurrent peak hours that are very

1022
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:19,910
difficult to examine outside of a model

1023
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">type environment and insights like that</font>

1024
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:25,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think of proven helpful in making</font>

1025
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:28,040
right business type decisions so for

1026
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">example making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity at</font>

1027
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:31,490
non-concurrent times available for other

1028
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,780
services and things of that sort that's

1029
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,459
right but you wouldn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> known about</font>

1030
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,280
or wouldn't have thought about how do

1031
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:39,080
you not done that level of intelligence

1032
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:41,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay wonderful any thoughts from I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1033
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:44,240
know if if the learning tool folks have

1034
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:47,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">any examples or thoughts on this you</font>

1035
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,830
know how the your customers have used

1036
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:50,240
the tool not only just for basic

1037
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,880
planning but then to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to the next</font>

1038
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,839
level in terms of deriving insights that

1039
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:59,360
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> help in the business as well</font>

1040
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:02,270
what most of the insights can be derived

1041
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:04,640
from the several kind of caution

1042
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:06,200
actually Tom mentioned that if you have

1043
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,810
three year planning<font color="#E5E5E5"> five year planning</font>

1044
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:14,149
so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> jeje those planning january</font>

1045
00:46:10,810 --> 00:46:17,120
the topology can be quickly constructed

1046
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:18,590
to give you some idea the traffic you

1047
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,600
are going to handle five years from

1048
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:24,290
today and then you can translate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1049
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:27,140
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you already have 210 geek</font>

1050
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:30,860
pipes and and five<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now you</font>

1051
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:34,100
imagine 10 times more capacity<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

1052
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:36,800
need about two thousand ten geeks then

1053
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:38,370
it drives you into some financial

1054
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,090
computation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1055
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:44,430
do you need to keep leasing wavelengths

1056
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:47,010
or lambdas or from from quest or from

1057
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:49,770
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three or you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to buy some</font>

1058
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:53,100
fiber directly or you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build some</font>

1059
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:57,750
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else so so so this kind of</font>

1060
00:46:53,100 --> 00:47:00,120
thing can be easily the exercise<font color="#CCCCCC"> ed if</font>

1061
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:03,000
the tool can help you construct the

1062
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:07,620
entire network<font color="#E5E5E5"> for for for whatever year</font>

1063
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,590
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are looking for so so the we</font>

1064
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:13,109
actually have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers every</font>

1065
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:15,990
every time they do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it two and half year</font>

1066
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:19,350
planning the end up with some a lot of

1067
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:21,930
proposal trying to to buy or lease or

1068
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:25,620
the all kinds of fiber acquisition plan

1069
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:30,359
and then due to their financial

1070
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:32,400
structure they they they they discard

1071
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:34,230
this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proposal just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say okay this</font>

1072
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,420
isn't that for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so they will keep</font>

1073
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:42,960
leasing so it will give you this kind of

1074
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:48,660
decision what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are finding is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1075
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:51,090
visibility is awfully low so the lack of

1076
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,770
information about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much traffic goes</font>

1077
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:54,600
from one end of the network to the other

1078
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,720
end or how much of customers traffic

1079
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,850
goes is extremely low<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the sort of</font>

1080
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,640
automation of discovery and automation

1081
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:04,470
of traffic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

1082
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,839
we find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> having that storehouse of</font>

1083
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:09,149
information available ends up being

1084
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,500
incredibly useful for all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of</font>

1085
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just would not have</font>

1086
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:16,350
thought about Tom<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention one cost</font>

1087
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:18,450
analysis per customer cost analysis is

1088
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:20,089
quite important sometimes it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

1089
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,020
just better to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out of some markets</font>

1090
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:24,330
absolutely you know you need to know

1091
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:26,220
what your cost structures and to do that

1092
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:29,190
you and for a lot of other business

1093
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:30,720
decisions you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know their how</font>

1094
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:34,170
much traffic is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> from where to</font>

1095
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,180
where in your network and that's that

1096
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:39,150
storehouse of information i think is is

1097
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:41,310
actually crucial for all of the business

1098
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:43,440
operations in fact what you just said

1099
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:45,900
arm on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> storehouse of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

1100
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:47,070
also the storehouse over time so you

1101
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:49,710
have a history<font color="#CCCCCC"> so as you just mentioned</font>

1102
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:51,270
if you're seeing consistently that some

1103
00:48:49,710 --> 00:48:52,830
something is costing you more or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1104
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,880
cost is going up over<font color="#E5E5E5"> time then as you</font>

1105
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,560
said you might actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to pull out</font>

1106
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,390
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that market and move to a different</font>

1107
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:59,339
market or or have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of</font>

1108
00:48:57,390 --> 00:49:02,549
offering that kind of service is that

1109
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:06,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you know quest and</font>

1112
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,560
done yeah you know we had a lot of

1113
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:16,650
topics there you know you know like

1114
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:20,040
building on you know you got to collect

1115
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:22,830
the information you know whether it be

1118
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:30,420
all of that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and there's open</font>

1119
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:31,980
source even tools that you can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1120
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:35,550
analyze that information but that's just

1121
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:37,410
for for one router or one link you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1122
00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:40,920
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes real hard when you have these</font>

1123
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:43,770
huge than sets of data and that's what

1124
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,650
tools you know caradin wandl help with

1125
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:49,200
is taking all that data crunching it to

1126
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:51,300
something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's useful because</font>

1127
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,069
ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean we don't like it but</font>

1128
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,390
all I mean we if we all had our<font color="#CCCCCC"> wave we</font>

1129
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:57,060
had unlimited budgets we could make

1130
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:59,549
perfect beautiful networks you know that

1131
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,810
ran great we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have that and so</font>

1132
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:03,960
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the business decisions have</font>

1133
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:06,000
to be made sure you know and then doing

00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that planning cycle and saying can we</font>

1135
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,490
get enough information to make good

00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,939
audience so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to switch</font>

1140
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:22,980
gears and have a couple questions and as

1141
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,020
we conclude this<font color="#E5E5E5"> session which is more</font>

1142
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,369
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of new services so one of the</font>

1143
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,230
things that one has been thinking about

1144
00:50:26,369 --> 00:50:32,520
this and influx of let's say IPTV and

1145
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:34,320
and video and so on so how's that if at

1146
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,910
all you know impacting the capacity

1147
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:38,460
planning process how are the operator is

1148
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:40,200
looking at it or what in your view in

1149
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,660
the operators are doing about these<font color="#CCCCCC"> new</font>

1150
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:50,180
services it would be useful to hear

1151
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:53,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">about I think you know the IP TV and</font>

1152
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:57,629
video on the internet is that explosive

1153
00:50:53,310 --> 00:51:00,060
area like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Duke said we also don't</font>

1154
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:02,130
differentiate a whole lot we try and

1155
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:05,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">capture what what's going to explode</font>

1156
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:08,009
but then we try and carry every packet

1157
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:11,849
and don't do a lot of differentiation

1158
00:51:08,009 --> 00:51:13,349
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think really the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the important</font>

1159
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:17,269
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get right with video is this</font>

1160
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:21,269
component of local delivery and there's

1161
00:51:17,269 --> 00:51:23,578
there's the aspect of you know if

1162
00:51:21,269 --> 00:51:25,558
something's delivered locally and it and

1163
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:28,079
it's exploding then it doesn't

1164
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,579
necessarily hit your traffic on the

1165
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:32,279
backbone and it doesn't necessarily hit

1166
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:35,099
your forecast so you have to get a real

1167
00:51:32,279 --> 00:51:38,250
good sense of what might fail in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1168
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:40,980
local area and create all of a sudden a

1169
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:43,490
very large demand across the backbone so

1170
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:47,190
that some of the areas that I think the

1171
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:52,189
future will require of us to look at

1172
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:56,900
quite a bit closer any thoughts<font color="#CCCCCC"> from yon</font>

1173
00:51:52,190 --> 00:52:00,029
from the vendors the<font color="#CCCCCC"> modeling vendors</font>

1174
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:02,579
perspective the one side is technology

1175
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:05,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to model</font>

1176
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:07,680
multicast and then and then for

1177
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,960
practical purpose if you already have

1178
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:12,000
some kind of multicast going then we

1179
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to able to reverse-engineer from</font>

1180
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,460
the network what's out there so you

1181
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:20,189
issue a social campaign like show em

1182
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,289
routes and we we will reverse engineer

1183
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:25,109
all those routing tables and then

1184
00:52:22,289 --> 00:52:27,839
reconstruct the entire spanning tree for

1185
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:31,769
you so that's that's the technology side

1186
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:33,869
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also it implementation side if you</font>

1187
00:52:31,769 --> 00:52:37,348
have layer to point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> multipoint</font>

1188
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:41,430
traffic engineering then then<font color="#CCCCCC"> how do you</font>

1189
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:43,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">configure the multicast tree and in the</font>

1190
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:47,788
other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do we configured a</font>

1191
00:52:43,019 --> 00:52:50,640
diverse<font color="#E5E5E5"> to diverse multicast tree so</font>

1192
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">that every receiver will always receive</font>

1193
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:57,328
a copy of the movie or TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> the at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

1194
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,089
time during any single outage how do you

1195
00:52:57,329 --> 00:53:02,309
issue those computation these are the

1196
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:06,210
things addressed by by the tool vendor

1197
00:53:02,309 --> 00:53:08,730
and on the capacity planning site it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1198
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:11,609
all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity so on the tree side</font>

1199
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:13,349
the tree as a consonant capacity the

1200
00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:16,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">Dapeng with consumption but if</font>

1201
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:19,200
unicast then there's just tons of tons

1202
00:53:16,859 --> 00:53:22,288
of capacity so you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

1203
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:24,109
talk cater to those modeling to see if

1204
00:53:22,289 --> 00:53:27,839
you can handle those capacities I

1205
00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:30,660
understand lately that level<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charice</font>

1206
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:34,859
traffic is the number one traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font>

00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:38,519
to be the netflix movie<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are already</font>

1208
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:41,759
exceeding the number two which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1209
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:44,220
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see ftp so so the movie content</font>

1210
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:49,069
being sending through level<font color="#CCCCCC"> three will</font>

1211
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:51,930
make level 3d the dynamic<font color="#CCCCCC"> one movie ddg</font>

1212
00:53:49,069 --> 00:53:55,079
transporter but then level she made me

1213
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,879
run into some capacity problem then<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1214
00:53:55,079 --> 00:54:00,869
can overflow to<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazon this kind of</font>

1215
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:06,269
thing but all these are interesting the

1216
00:54:00,869 --> 00:54:07,680
dynamics in the marketplace in touch so

1217
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:09,839
interesting you asked about new new

1218
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,569
services again going back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1219
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,920
difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between the backbone</font>

00:54:11,569 --> 00:54:15,630
operations<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus edge operations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1221
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,079
think it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good thing that</font>

1222
00:54:15,630 --> 00:54:21,029
backbone folks are service agnostic it

1223
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:24,089
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know they build a solid</font>

1224
00:54:21,029 --> 00:54:26,880
backbone across which many services can

1225
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:28,799
be created and delivered quickly without

1226
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,690
requiring changes to the backbone it's

1227
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:32,999
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult enough to create the</font>

1228
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:34,529
service on the edge and all the customer

1229
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:36,089
facing part of it they're all the

1230
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:38,190
backbone is to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide those</font>

1231
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:40,920
services that are currently there and in

1232
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:44,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">the future what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find most challenging</font>

1233
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,690
about the new service creation for

1234
00:54:44,309 --> 00:54:48,239
networks for doing their backbone

1235
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:51,329
correctly is in the edge in the regional

1236
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:52,950
networks and that's where the challenges

1237
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:57,839
turn out to be different<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge</font>

1238
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:59,430
in the core is how to do good analysis

1239
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:01,529
how to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> good what ifs how to do a good</font>

1240
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:04,379
optimization the challenge in the edge

1241
00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:06,329
again has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with automation as you</font>

1242
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:11,759
can ask very smart people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like Duke and</font>

1243
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:14,880
Tom who spend their time on a very

1244
00:55:11,759 --> 00:55:18,599
expensive backbone infrastructure but if

1245
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:21,749
you have 100 metros<font color="#CCCCCC"> 50 metals or 500 in</font>

1246
00:55:18,599 --> 00:55:25,190
some cases where those services start

1247
00:55:21,749 --> 00:55:27,169
and end that capacity planning and

1248
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:30,589
those operational elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have</font>

1249
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:34,490
to be automated and that's really again

1250
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:35,900
where we see ourselves playing both with

1251
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:39,049
a GUI for folks who are doing the

1252
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,790
analysis themselves and on the edge for

1253
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:44,060
those who<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need this work to be</font>

1254
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:46,339
automated building on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

1255
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:50,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">tremendous pressures coming by because</font>

1256
00:55:46,339 --> 00:55:52,400
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have everyone wanting to do content</font>

1257
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:54,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">everywhere right I mean that's the big</font>

1258
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,550
push from content delivery you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1259
00:55:54,829 --> 00:56:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in even even network people is</font>

1260
00:55:57,550 --> 00:56:03,530
content everywhere so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> watch your</font>

1261
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:07,940
TV shows on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your laptop on your cell</font>

1262
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:09,920
phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> wherever whenever right so so we</font>

1263
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:14,180
crucified sprint guy just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other day</font>

1264
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:18,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">right because so you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two pressures</font>

1265
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:20,779
you have marketing from people like my

1266
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:22,550
company that are saying yeah bring it on

1267
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:25,460
you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to have content</font>

1268
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:26,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">everywhere but then you have so that's</font>

1269
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:28,760
the marketing we're selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're</font>

1270
00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,799
selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right and then the pressure</font>

1271
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:33,829
though is building out the network

1272
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:36,950
building out the spectrum<font color="#CCCCCC"> right to</font>

1273
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:40,250
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that and a mom's right i mean</font>

1274
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:42,348
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the backbone will be</font>

1275
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:44,630
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to adjust and handle it it's the</font>

1276
00:56:42,349 --> 00:56:46,849
access that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really going to</font>

1277
00:56:44,630 --> 00:56:48,890
have the issues and capacity planning

1278
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:50,960
that access is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1279
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:53,839
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it once</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again from a</font>

1280
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,430
camino from us network guys you know we

1281
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,619
say well yeah just put a bigger link if

1282
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:59,960
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what's the problem and then you</font>

1283
00:56:57,619 --> 00:57:02,030
can't get funding for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

1284
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:03,319
that's the two pressures that are coming

1285
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:05,960
and it's it's it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

1286
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:08,569
whirlwind pressure it's gonna it's going

1287
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,550
to hit pretty hard that's between the

1288
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:12,589
need for content everywhere versus the

1289
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:15,109
cost of<font color="#E5E5E5"> diluting that but then one to</font>

1290
00:57:12,589 --> 00:57:17,270
sell it to know and I think the good

1291
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:18,560
point was made was that in the access

1292
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:20,030
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to worry about the automation</font>

1293
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,819
and can you automate fast enough in the

1294
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:24,050
choreo more worried about just looking

1295
00:57:22,819 --> 00:57:25,279
at it<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a capacity planning</font>

1296
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:27,859
perspective and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term perspective</font>

1297
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,800
and the axis also changing very fast so

1298
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:33,319
in closing I'd like to ask you know all

1299
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:34,790
the panelists you know coming of course

1300
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:36,319
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operators side and what what is</font>

1301
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:37,390
on your wish list you've talked a lot

1302
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,580
about how are using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1303
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,779
and what they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but you know</font>

1304
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,190
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we said a lot of</font>

1305
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,900
developments that are coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> down the</font>

1306
00:57:42,190 --> 00:57:46,750
pike both in terms of technologies and

1307
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,190
services so what what might<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shed</font>

1308
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:49,480
light on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of what's on your wish</font>

1309
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:52,600
list that you might want to see in the

1310
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:55,540
tools going forward you know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> near</font>

1311
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:59,140
term and the medium term I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I've</font>

1312
00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:04,529
mentioned this before but we need to get

1313
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:08,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">a better understanding for enter a</font>

1314
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:11,610
s-type traffic flows for example when a

1315
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:14,589
failure happens within your network

1316
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:17,740
there's bgp<font color="#E5E5E5"> next-hop changes that happen</font>

1317
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:21,070
and there needs to be some development

1318
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:24,609
work in understanding that traffic that

1319
00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:27,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you detect and measure on LSP basis now</font>

1320
00:58:24,610 --> 00:58:29,830
will shift to some new pattern and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1321
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,450
involves<font color="#CCCCCC"> knowing what what traffic flow</font>

1322
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:33,759
is coming in from different a esas are

1323
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:37,629
going to different uses any other

1324
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:40,270
thoughts closing you know if wish list

1325
00:58:37,630 --> 00:58:43,360
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure I'll go big I'll go</font>

1326
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:47,530
babe because it would require IETF and I

1327
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:49,840
Triple E standards network discovery so

1328
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:51,940
have a tool that you can just turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1329
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:54,580
and it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> discover your network</font>

1330
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:56,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">from layer 1 through layer 3 of the</font>

1331
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,330
network so you have both<font color="#E5E5E5"> your transport</font>

1332
00:58:56,590 --> 00:59:00,700
layer and your data layer you can load

1333
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:02,500
them all it just just discovers it all

1334
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:04,330
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do it today</font>

1335
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:07,540
because every vendor does things

1336
00:59:04,330 --> 00:59:10,420
differently they don't enter off but

1337
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:12,520
have IETF standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Tripoli standards</font>

1338
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:14,530
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interop you can take this</font>

1339
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,780
tool and then with this one tool you

1340
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:19,540
cannot only run your NOC through it to

1341
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:21,460
to monitor the network and know that

1342
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:23,890
this data router is plugged<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this</font>

1343
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:26,290
transmission port you know and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1344
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:28,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">see all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but then you through that</font>

1345
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:30,100
same tool then you can run your NOC you

1346
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:31,870
can also run your capacity planning like

1347
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:34,720
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do sure with modeling and so</font>

1348
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:36,940
forth and then getting data mining data

1349
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,009
which Tom and I struggle with that

1350
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:40,180
probably you know how to get our data I

1351
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:42,790
mean that's that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have</font>

1352
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:44,319
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and carrot in and wandl then all</font>

1353
00:59:42,790 --> 00:59:47,170
that can be all put into one

1354
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:49,480
and you have real-time data when you

1355
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:51,370
need it where you yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean why I wish</font>

1356
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,350
multi-layer discovery is obviously

1357
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:54,940
important I mean given their this again

1358
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:56,830
I mean we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this 10 years back but now</font>

1359
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,770
again this focus on packet optical and

1360
00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:01,450
IP optical and integrating the two and

1361
00:59:58,770 --> 01:00:03,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> large operators and I'm sure many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1362
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:05,230
the medium operators also are looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1363
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:07,660
how do you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-layer Network</font>

1364
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:09,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">management and clearly a tools that will</font>

1365
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:12,250
allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that as you mentioned I</font>

1366
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,660
mean of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you went to a full set of</font>

1367
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:16,120
multi-layer discovery but even if you

1368
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:18,990
can do it at two layers you know you get

1369
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:22,089
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more insight into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the network so</font>

1370
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:24,839
I'll be brief<font color="#E5E5E5"> I second thumbs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font>

1371
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:27,490
we do the l1 discovery and it's painful

1372
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,320
tl1 all sorts of commands<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

1373
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:32,169
patching it together to make the layer

1374
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:34,930
one segment of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the plan buzzes painful</font>

1375
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,010
and that would help a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

1376
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:37,600
any other thoughts from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience</font>

1377
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,920
before we close the session out this is

1378
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,420
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> last opportunity to ask something</font>

1379
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:42,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course the panelists are there so you</font>

1380
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:47,230
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> always talk to them after the after</font>

1381
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:49,540
the panel itself going once go again did

1382
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:52,450
you answer the G some of the wish list

1383
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:54,640
found from from Duke actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

1384
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:58,629
discovery front layer tree is easy

1385
01:00:54,640 --> 01:01:02,500
because you you have ospf you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> NPR's</font>

1386
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:04,990
they are all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GG quite easy for</font>

1387
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:07,960
example if you have MPs all you need in

1388
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:11,620
a Juniper router is say show Ted

1389
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:14,980
database extensive than the entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> MPs</font>

1390
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:19,000
topologies discovered the only layer to

1391
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:22,600
cite the it's already<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

1392
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,390
frustrating because the cisco has CDP

1393
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:30,270
and the rest of the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> i sing with</font>

1394
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:34,330
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exceptional DG extreme using EDP</font>

1395
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:36,390
everybody else is pretty much<font color="#CCCCCC"> lldp so we</font>

1396
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:39,990
have already get into this territory

1397
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:42,339
using all this discovery protocol and

1398
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:45,370
collect all the information about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1399
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:48,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">spanning tree and the entire layer to</font>

1400
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:52,029
discovery so those capability is already

1401
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,100
in place and on the optical sight most

1402
01:01:52,030 --> 01:01:54,930
of the optical vendor that they are not

1403
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:59,040
into

1404
01:01:54,930 --> 01:02:01,169
operate at all so on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand is</font>

1405
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:04,529
the interesting phenomena in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the optical</font>

1406
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:07,890
network almost every optical vendor has

1407
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:11,030
their own tool like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco 15454 has</font>

1408
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:14,460
their Cisco planning tool and then I

1409
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:17,220
guess the ni has<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sienna codirector</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1410
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:20,309
planning tool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jesus was planning to</font>

1411
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:23,700
the the audio optical vendor they all

1412
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:25,349
come come the engineer I I think that's

1413
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:28,140
the next stop they have a planning tool

1414
01:02:25,349 --> 01:02:30,990
so all this planning<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool actually can</font>

1415
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:32,790
discover their network so one of the

1416
01:02:30,990 --> 01:02:36,689
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for is more</font>

1417
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:39,869
integration with the with the network

1418
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:43,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">design tool vendors meaning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if the</font>

1419
01:02:39,869 --> 01:02:46,500
optical tool can export some information

1420
01:02:43,290 --> 01:02:48,869
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is relatively generic for example</font>

1421
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:52,680
if a lot of tanking circuits is carried
