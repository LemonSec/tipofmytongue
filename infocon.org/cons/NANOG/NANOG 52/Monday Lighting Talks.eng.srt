1
00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:12,260
so entity America has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing ipv6</font>

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,570
for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brief</font>

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,630
history thing we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been working on</font>

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:22,010
doing this with entity labs and whatnot

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:25,580
since the early<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6mon days I personally</font>

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:28,400
came out of cic net where we ran ipv6

7
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,778
quite quite a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time ago and we've</font>

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">been doing this for for a long time we</font>

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,879
engineering and have been continuing to

11
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:40,909
operate in that case so the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

12
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:44,449
about to present here is sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of before</font>

13
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:46,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">after enduring ipv6 day here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

you know not<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network is</font>

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:56,059
exporting this data that we're you know

17
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:58,820
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see we're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow v9</font>

18

19
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:05,689
looking at customer appearing interfaces

20
00:01:00,619 --> 00:01:09,890
so here's the data so prior to ipv6 day

21
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:13,729
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically this is the the seven days</font>

22
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:15,950
preceding here this shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the traffic</font>

23
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:18,980

24
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:23,600
120 for megs of total ipv6 traffic

25
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:26,030
that's viewable on our network you know

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,500
about 60 Meg's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP UDP is about</font>

27
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,300
31 mags and then there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful</font>

28
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,810
line of ICMP which everyone seems to

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,220
think that ipv6 is full of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

30
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,320
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of flows per second</font>

31
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,770
that go and hit our collector obviously

32
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:45,490
that's not a lot you know the PPS graph

33
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:47,750
looks pretty much identical to that

34
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,190
there's a few little differences but

35
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,850
that's about it and then you know

36
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:54,890
everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> says oh ipv6 it's all just ping</font>

37
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,899
and pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much throughout the time</font>

38
00:01:54,890 --> 00:02:00,380
there's this standard background

39
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:03,710
radiation of ICMP ping v6 activity

40
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,880
that's going on so for ipv6 day we did a

41
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,279
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we went around we</font>

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,560
dual-stack customer and pure interfaces

43
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,180
we went and did some audits the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing</font>

44
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,800
table tried to get customers and peers

45
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,200
to turn up v6 if they weren't doing it

46
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,819
directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us and we noticed a</font>

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,130
considerable amount of growth leading up

48
00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:19,079
into

49
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,579

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,050
you look at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you say when else</font>

51
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,670
have you seen over the course of a month

52
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:28,050
of time about 370 unique networks

53
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,850
autonomous systems actually add routes

54
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,580
into the routing table there's really a

55
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,870
significant amount of growth in the v6

56
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:43,320
table as a result and it's actually

57
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:45,810
continued on from that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave are</font>

up<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is just basically a WC minus</font>

you know a prefix and you know one of

65
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,610
the sample prefixes and who were

66
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:07,830
originated it or if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> showed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

67
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,590
anywhere in a s path but you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

68
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:13,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">about a whole bunch of people who added</font>

69
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,570
ipv6 into their networks over the past

70
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,480
month yeah it's just kind of curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

71
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,680
if we're able to I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's</font>

72
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">really early and everything but we're</font>

73
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,290
trying to analyze this data and so I was

74
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">a sign of kind of curious to see if</font>

75
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,209
people were announcing more specifics in

76
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,679
any way I mean yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

77
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,090
specifics on the table but I really

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,220
didn't I really didn't focus my efforts

79
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,250
on that I really focus my efforts on

80
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,920
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> our customers who did before</font>

81
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,660
with us would do v6 with us as well on

82
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,450
those interfaces because we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

83
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,220
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for many many years just</font>

84
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:50,369
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they had that turned up um</font>

85
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:52,440
so here's the big the big slide the ipv6

86
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,690
day traffic levels we saw traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

87
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,550
double in the network for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ipv6</font>

88
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:58,109
traffic as you see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> one up here you</font>

89
00:03:56,550 --> 00:04:02,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we have a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Peaks up in the</font>

90
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:03,840
202 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 50 megs frame but when you</font>

91
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,240
start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that that's 250</font>

92
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,420
megs globally across the entire network

93
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,640
where we have this IP v6 NetFlow data of

94
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,790
course it's an imperfect view but that's

95
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,738
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump in traffic overall when</font>

96
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:19,079
you consider how many gigs or terabytes

97
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:23,340
or whatnot or terabits per second of

98
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,010
traffic a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> major carrier carries</font>

99
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,700
um the breakdown of that we pretty much

100
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,710
saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all that spike was www traffic</font>

101
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,960
you know you've got sixty four percent

102
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:36,539
of it was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one percent was</font>

103
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,270
basically torrenting and stuff once you

104
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,880
add<font color="#CCCCCC"> up add in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rsync and ssh activity</font>

105
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:44,130
that happens as well you're up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 90</font>

106
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,750
something percent range and what's

107
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,820
really interesting to me personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

108
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,810
you look at the ipv6 UDP traffic

109
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,219
statistics and that is all dns queries

110
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,890
there's it's pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing else</font>

111
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,160
after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ports drop out into you</font>

112
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:01,890
know some in significant numbers so you

113
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">know ipv6 is used at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for DNS a lot</font>

114
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:08,159
so I don't know if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

115
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:10,670
other traffic slide since ipv6 day you

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,470
can see sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this tapering off here</font>

117
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,950
there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> some ongoing traffic</font>

118
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,900
spikes that we see where we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

119
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,840
peeking above the ipv6 day traffic

120
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">levels that's not necessarily surprising</font>

121
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,179
because if you have to Giggy connected

122
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:28,620
hosts on my network you could go and

123
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:31,320
create something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

124
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,850
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> graph if you are doing ipv6 between</font>

125
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,920
them but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really interesting to</font>

126
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:37,850
continue to see the you know these

127
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,890
spikes and this big spike here we saw

128
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,720
there on the 9th was actually in

129
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:47,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Amsterdam where we were doing about 300</font>

130
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,980
megs of traffic um so then since ipv6

131
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,600
day this shows ipv6 day roughly here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

132
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,430
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of the graphic we didn't see</font>

133
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">any change in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the amount of ICMP traffic</font>

134
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,030
which means everyone who is monitoring

135
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:58,470
what was going on before hand nobody

136
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">changed the monitoring that we're going</font>

137
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:03,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">for ipv6 day the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> background radiation</font>

138
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,010
stayed the same roughly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we've seen</font>

139
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,450
it may be a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an uptick</font>

140
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,450
since then but that's about it

141
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:25,419
anything else I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might find if</font>

142
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you look really hard at this these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

143
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:31,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">all the bittorrent zombies who have gone</font>

144
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:35,199
to tirado and our failing the rendezvous

145
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,790
it that's entirely possible but I didn't

146
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,680
look at actually I didn't look inside my

147
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:41,110
customers packets to you don't need to

148
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,720
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> only ICMP there's no payload and</font>

149
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,190
the fact that it's dark means that you

150
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,940
know you're seeing the standard behavior

151
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,139
of wacko tirado in some instances but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

152
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:52,630
think what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will find is what the</font>

153
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:55,090
same as I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing that all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that ICMP</font>

154
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,460
ping are not people pinging it's

155
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually an application that finds a</font>

156
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:03,909
tirado interface down there in the stack

157
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:07,150
and decides<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it yeah that could</font>

158
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:09,160
definitely be the case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font>

159
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:10,388
you know we didn't do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of in-depth</font>

160
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,370
research on this we basically we're just

161
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,470
looking at the traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels of what we</font>

162
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:16,270
saw and then here I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last-minute</font>

163
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">addition you know on saturday and sunday</font>

164
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">i added this in last night you know we</font>

165
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,430
you know we continue to see pretty big

166
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:25,870
traffic spikes on the graphs and it does

167
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,780
look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we're continuing seeing upward</font>

168
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:30,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">trend to traffic with ipv6 and</font>

169
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,739
considering how many networks turned it

170
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,000
on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> month and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guessing a</font>

171
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,639
lot of you here are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back and</font>

172
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">do that as well who haven't already done</font>

173
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,250
it I think we're going to see the

174
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:44,409
ongoing traffic increase<font color="#E5E5E5"> ramp up pretty</font>

175
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,830
quickly here so I'm pretty excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

176
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:50,229
the future of ipv6 and I'm personally

177
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">hoping for a repeat of the world v6 day</font>

178
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:56,159
and seen a lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn it on and</font>

179
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:58,840
leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on for good so thank you oh</font>

180
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah and so thank you too i sock yahoo</font>

181
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,310
and everyone who put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on world ipv6 day</font>

182
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,930
it's a it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really awesome to be able</font>

183
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:07,120
to look at it and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was most anti</font>

184
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,820
climactic you know war room type day

185
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,169
ever in my experience but it was good

186
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,169
overall so thank you

187
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:24,169
and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you jared and moving on that</font>

188
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,058
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear from very green from</font>

189
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:34,578
is see who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be talking to us</font>

190
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:37,699
about passive DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this is a quick</font>

191
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:39,169
one on an appeal for all of you who are

192
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:40,578
operators have had some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of DNS</font>

193
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,728
infrastructure especially resolve our

194
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:45,349
infrastructure on pasadena some reason

195
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,870
why we're bringing this appeal out to

196
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,490
get more participants in this program is

197
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,319
submit and data into it is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

198
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,149
become a very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful tool for</font>

199
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:54,800
anybody who's doing investigative work

200
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,800
and what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the badness out</font>

201
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,709
on the net it's becoming a big shortcut

202
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,979
and one case um there was one individual

203
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:05,029
works at one of the big operators and he

204
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,829
thought he<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a pretty good</font>

205
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:09,139
infrastructure in his operations and

206
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:11,269
then we get access to the user interface

207
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:12,740
and he said and one night<font color="#CCCCCC"> he got three</font>

208
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">months of work done and investigating</font>

209
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,019
some of the badness on his own network

210
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,130
so we're putting this appeal out with it

211
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:21,440
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the stuff and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll show</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

212
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:23,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">a demo</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it is is all this stuff</font>

213
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,100
where the bad guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been hiding</font>

214
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,269
behind dns and protecting the zone files

215
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,639
and we can't figure out what they're

216
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:30,230
doing what passive DNS is a tool where

217
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,630
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get behind what they're doing we</font>

218
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,339
can see the badness in the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

219
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">Paul bixi Paul vixy would say you know</font>

220
00:09:34,339 --> 00:09:38,000
take taken taken Tina's back from the

221
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,510
bad guys this is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tools that</font>

222
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,550
were using to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that with this is an</font>

223
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,170
idea that started 2004 or flooring and

224
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">why mark kind of created the idea and</font>

225
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:48,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">then people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been involved with it</font>

226
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">is he has been wanted organizations</font>

227
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,300
evolving the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it essentially</font>

228
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:56,029
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing is you put in a sensor</font>

229
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">in your resolve our network and we only</font>

230
00:09:56,029 --> 00:10:00,560
care about that traffic going from you

231
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:01,940
resolver out to the rest of the world we

232
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,130
don't care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> any information become</font>

233
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,290
coming from your clients so in one case

234
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,760
we're protecting p I<font color="#E5E5E5"> information don't</font>

235
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to worry about P I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> informations not</font>

236
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">leaving your network and then if you're</font>

237
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,339
worried about people tracing back that

238
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're a source of some of this stuff in</font>

239
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:19,279
the actual sensor you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> configure it</font>

240
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,410
where the actual ID of the center gets

241
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,899
turned off so so when it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the</font>

242
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:25,709
aggregate nobody can trace it back that

243
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,510
provider ex

244
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:29,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I did this data set because what we're</font>

245
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:30,900
really looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for is the aggregate the</font>

246
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,040
aggregate<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together so we can get a</font>

247
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:36,360
visibility what's going on with it so

248
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,030
what I'm going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is jump</font>

249
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,190
out and kind of give you a quick demo to

250
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,930
give you an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff this is the</font>

251
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,210
user interface you get of one of the

252
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,250
tools this is the DNS db2<font color="#CCCCCC"> love Robert</font>

253
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:49,860
Evans created<font color="#E5E5E5"> over is see that</font>

254
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,280
aggregates it together and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

255
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,830
particular subnet right so we can search

256
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,339
on whole subnets and on this a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

257
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:01,560
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> noticing there's a bunch of PHP</font>

258
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">metasploit servers out there and so you</font>

259
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,280
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what else is on that subnet</font>

260
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,989
because I<font color="#E5E5E5"> only spotted one and you piss</font>

261
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,360
it out there and you know you start

262
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:11,640
seeing I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> over already you know when</font>

263
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,860
we put this in there you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see this</font>

264
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,360
subnet is just polluted all over the

265
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,150
freakin place but a whole bunch of

266
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,610
malware criminal sort of activities with

267
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,439
it with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a four of</font>

268
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,180
DNS we wouldn't be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this now</font>

269
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:26,520
with this tool we're able to see it

270
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,410
where your contribution comes in there

271
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,329
is the more submissions the better

272
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,640
because we're how this works is based

273
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:34,710
off the demand you know some clients

274
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:37,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">somewhere does a query into the system</font>

275
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:39,120
it's collected by passive DNS it goes

276
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:41,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the big database giving</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

277
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,110
example this is a domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> name on here</font>

278
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:45,359
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we pulled off with the Zeus tracker</font>

279
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,190
so I go to the zoo<font color="#CCCCCC"> strapper site this</font>

280
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,660
came up as a Zeus come in a control

281
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,920
center a location so I get the records

282

430
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,030
completely revamp the who is

431
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,310
infrastructure put out home on these

432
00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,310
services all new software so all new

433
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,560
servers and all new software and one of

434
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,810
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we did was besides revamping</font>

435
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,179
the port 43 service is we have the

436
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:09,310
restful web service on top of that today

437
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,700
that accounts for forty percent of our

438
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,000
who is

439
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,029
traffic on top of that we added<font color="#E5E5E5"> cider</font>

440
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,950
support so back in july of last year we

441
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:19,990
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> some initial cider support in there</font>

442
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:22,809
and then in March when we did our big

443
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:25,149
release we added some we basically made

444
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,710
it better so both over port 43 and the

445
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:29,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">rest webservice you know you can now do</font>

as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well which is now now in production</font>

456

and people are talking about trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

457
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,000
come up with a unified standard as

458

opposed to all of us doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> at our own</font>

470
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:33,820
as of the March release we now have a

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,720
there's an operational test and

couple of years and so those are no

you submit a template<font color="#CCCCCC"> that requires a</font>

to the web portal and see the ticket

00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,709
there and that's what the API key does
