00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:12,230
hi I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> known Milo here for a really</font>

2
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">long time and he was brave enough to</font>

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,340
come and be<font color="#CCCCCC"> our keynote even though i</font>

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:19,279
know enough dirt on him to probably

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:22,970
embarrass him several times over but i'm

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to anyway so I met Milo</font>

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:27,650
virtually in 1989 when I was in the

8
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,990
merit knock and there was an earthquake

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">in California and one of the NOC</font>

10
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,260
operators happened to be exchanging

11
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,320
email with Milo at the time of the

12
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,730
earthquake and Milo said wow there's an

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,120
earthquake it's the biggest shake of my

14
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:42,949
life I better leave the building now and

15
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:45,199
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think Milo knows this but at</font>

16
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,570
that point the Ann Arbor news thought

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,690
that was super<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool they came to the NOC</font>

18
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:54,620
they put Milo's email on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the evening</font>

19
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:57,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">news and they interviewed our PR person</font>

20
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:59,629
at the NSFNET who said they asked her

21
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,399
why it was that the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> was still up</font>

22
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,699
when you couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a phone call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

23
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:07,040
she very sincerely described how the

24
00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,889
phone lines were actually suspended

25
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,399
above the ground whereas the network was

26
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:17,119
buried and so therefore it was

27
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:21,200
impervious to earthquakes which I

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,719
thought was SuperDuper funny so the

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,609
second time I met Milo virtually we were

30
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:28,428
having a regional text meeting which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

31
00:01:25,609 --> 00:01:29,809
what Nana used to be and we were all on

32
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:33,469
this little conference room and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

33
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:36,020
topic<font color="#E5E5E5"> of discussion was how the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

34
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:39,318
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> saturated because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> myla was playing a</font>

35
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,319
war game with his friend of course it

36
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:44,539
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even t1 then anyway so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I worked</font>

37
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,539
with my load at<font color="#CCCCCC"> home which was a really</font>

38
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:49,609
good time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now Milo is the VP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

39
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:51,200
access at Google and I don't want to

40
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:55,059
take any more<font color="#E5E5E5"> time from his fabulous</font>

41
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,060
talk so we'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy things</font>

42
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:04,520
Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Kathy wow it's been a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

43
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,920
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> since I've been at an odd this is a</font>

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:14,630
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of place I know maybe</font>

45
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:18,170
five or six people here the it as one of

46
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:22,340
the old guys I guess Kathy wanted me to

47
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:24,500
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and give a talk about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> history</font>

48
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:29,000
of the internet but to borrow a phrase

49
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">from Peggy Noonan's book I think this is</font>

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,340
more about what I saw at the revolution

51
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,080
and really what the internet the history

52
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:42,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is a story of revolution I</font>

53
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,020
was an early ARPANET user when I was in

54
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:48,049
high school in the Central Valley of

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:52,430
California I actually had an apple too

56
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,620
and i bought a cat modem any of you

57
00:02:52,430 --> 00:03:01,070
remember these acoustic coupler modems

58
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:04,130
okay 300 baud<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the ARPANET</font>

59
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:08,140
from folks at the local university at

60
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:12,920
Fresno State and I dialed long distance

61
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:15,619
into the tip right which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old</font>

62
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:17,958
name for terminal servers in those days

63
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,150
of the ARPANET and just started

64
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,910
exploring one of the great things about

65
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:26,090
the net and back in those days was it

66
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't that important to people right so</font>

67
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:32,030
you could actually fool around quite a

68
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:35,750
bit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and and this was not really</font>

69
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:38,300
frowned upon there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer called</font>

70
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:41,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">MITM see where i got my first email</font>

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:46,670

73
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:50,630
funny things was if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> tried to log in</font>

74
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,799
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you didn't have an account it would</font>

75
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,190
say would you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to make you an</font>

76
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:59,180
account and so that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> my first email</font>

77
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,810
account<font color="#E5E5E5"> I went to school at UC Berkeley</font>

78
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:04,670
and majored in computer science and

79
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:07,420
there I learned about<font color="#E5E5E5"> unix I learned</font>

80
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:11,179
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ARPANET and later about tcp/ip</font>

81
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:13,339
one of the fun things I did was

82
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,590
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a chance to work on defense</font>

83
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,630
programs at Livermore Lab and I always

84
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working with nuclear weapons</font>

85
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:22,850
design was always a good background for

00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:27,289
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with competing with incumbents</font>

87
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:29,930
in both places though one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the great</font>

88
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:32,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">things was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you got to see computers</font>

89
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:35,240
from different kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of manufacturers</font>

90
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,270
all working together that wasn't the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

91
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:43,100
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world worked back then i</font>

92
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:45,799
moved to<font color="#CCCCCC"> nasa in 1985 and joined a brand</font>

00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,470
new networking group<font color="#CCCCCC"> nasa was mostly a</font>

manned<font color="#CCCCCC"> space centers they were IBM</font>

96
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:58,699
mainframe based so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only tech</font>

97
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:02,840
guy in the group<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what did I do</font>

98
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:05,509
well we ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNIX on boxes just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like we</font>

99
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,130
did at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Berkeley and became an advocate</font>

100
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:13,130
for TCP IP and later my team had the

101
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:17,210
opportunity to build NASA's backbone

102
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:20,599
system which brings us up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the my</font>

103
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:25,280
first encounter with the IETF that was

104
00:05:20,599 --> 00:05:27,830
1986 I was 23 years old at the time and

105
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the great thing about the</font>

106
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:32,560
the net back in those days was if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

107

really wanted to advance the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

108
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,389
you were really<font color="#CCCCCC"> welcomed and it's like</font>

another soldier for the fight because<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

world the deck world and the internet

113
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,460
was anything but a sure thing the

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:59,360
community was<font color="#E5E5E5"> tightly knit this is the</font>

attendance list of that first IETF back

in nineteen eighty of six that I

attended<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think was the fourth one and</font>

118
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,720
you could see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> usual suspects there</font>

from BB n and n from sr<font color="#CCCCCC"> i-- the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the old</font>

hasn't it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing this this group used</font>

123
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,240
to be that small a long long time

124
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:32,389
go and now we're as as big as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf</font>

converted over to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS at that time</font>

130
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:53,300
the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing was you know 515</font>

00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:55,820
total networks 144 internet gateways

132

what routers used to be called in those

133
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:04,070
days we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had the ARPANET and the mill net</font>

134
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:08,210
had just been split apart these were<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

old BB NC 30s acting as as packet

00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:14,930
switches and they had the famous<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1822</font>

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,810
interface by acc we've was later

138
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:20,060
upgraded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> X 25 which was a terrible</font>

139
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,870
thing and Craig partridge and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

140
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:26,360
used to joke about how we needed to make

141
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:29,240
t-shirts that said 18 20 20 braless

142
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,699
that's a really inside joke of people

152
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:07,159
as topology started growing we had lots

instance of network management code that

177
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:30,370
I was aware of he put in prioritization

178
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,630
so that telnet traffic and TCP acts

would get priority over ftp and email

189
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:07,510
was a lot of discussion about how to try

and and finesse this to try and bring

the agencies we partnered with each

289
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,399
it was

290
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,930
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because in most nations</font>

291
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:22,910
people didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

292
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">each other with the internet but if you</font>

293
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,469
put a pipe into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to the to the rest</font>

294
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,170
of the world they'd build connectivity

295
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:33,880
internally to<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

296
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:36,709
and that worked over worked really well

297
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:38,870
overtime costs shifted more and more

298
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:40,609
costs were borne by the by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nations</font>

299
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,560
and eventually we could we could get out

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,459
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a great way to</font>

301
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:52,189
build infrastructure this is a picture

302
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:54,439
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NASA network back in 1991 I think</font>

303
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:57,529
at the time we had the highest and

304
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,940
lowest latitudes in the network we had a

305
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:04,910
satellite circuit to a research site at

306
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,880
tule Air Force Base<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Greenland and we</font>

307
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:12,139
also had a satellite circuit to McMurdo

308
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:15,680
base in the in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Antarctic to get to</font>

309
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:17,569
McMurdo was a real problem because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

310
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,050
know satellites are in geostationary

311
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:23,990
orbit and so when you're down really

312
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">south it's you can't have good looking</font>

313
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,490
angle on the spacecraft we got a good

314
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:30,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal on a wobbly satellite who had lost</font>

315
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:32,569
its station-keeping fuel and so it

316
00:16:30,829 --> 00:16:36,170
turned out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in an orbit that was a</font>

317
00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:38,569
was good we moved a 9 meter satellite

318
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:40,790
earth station on an island black island

319
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:44,000
40 klicks north of McMurdo base

320
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,209
assembled it and then built a microwave

321
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,699
relay across the ice cap to McMurdo base

322
00:16:47,209 --> 00:16:52,758
and that was good enough to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

323
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:54,829
something like half a t1 of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

324
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,750
capacity down there which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> mux than</font>

325
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:59,680
they could use it for phone calls etc

326
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:02,029
there was a storm at one point which

327
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,349
collapsed the roof of the administration

328
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:07,640
building at McMurdo knocking out the HF

329
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:10,428
shortwave radios that they use to

330
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:13,760
communicate but the satellite connection

331
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:18,169
stayed up and so coordinating flights

332
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:22,010
into the Antarctic was done via via that

333
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:25,610
link and later we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> put a ground</font>

334
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:28,459
station at McMurdo and one at<font color="#E5E5E5"> South Pole</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and a certain part of the day would pop</font>

339
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,920
up over the South Pole and users at

340
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,070
South Pole would uplink data back down

341
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:48,520
to McMurdo base and and get their email

342
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:51,149
and science data moved around those were

00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:10,330
regional networks EG p was being used

349
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:13,480
between networks but protocols like rip

350
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:15,610
and I grp didn't do a particularly good

just inter connect directly with each

anymore we would just appear with each

366
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,750
other directly we had a building as our

367
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,450
telecommunications facility that we used

368
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:06,580
to blow things up in I was sick it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

369
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:09,580
relatively<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure it had something like</font>

370
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:11,710
12 inch thick concrete walls and so it

371
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">was decided that we would be the host</font>

372
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,270
for this we discussed the idea of our

373
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:22,930
bosses and the next day they gave

374
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:26,170
approval the NSFNET had a team one hub

375
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:29,910
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Palo Alto at barnet and then they</font>

376
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:34,300
extended on RT up to our site<font color="#E5E5E5"> es net and</font>

377
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:37,540
MILNET extended networks and so we

378
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually had a first real peering</font>

384
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the front line we we called it</font>

385
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,379
that because we thought it was the front

386
00:19:54,170 --> 00:20:00,170
line<font color="#CCCCCC"> of routing and in fact the ethernet</font>

387
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:03,050

388
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:05,090
the Demilitarized Zone which made sense

389
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:07,100
if you thought of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the front line</font>

390
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:10,090

use of the term DMZ back in those days

392
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:17,560
later for political reasons we had to

393
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:17,560
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mark pullin who was the</font>

doing it I in about 36 hours later

418
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:35,419
patches were available and the worst was

419
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:40,540
was basically over though we still had

infections at various sites after<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:22,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">and nobody would do anything about it</font>

434
00:22:20,659 --> 00:22:24,679
eventually I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to folks that nor</font>

435
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jeunet who wouldn't do anything about it</font>

436
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:33,440
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my friend at least</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Garak at</font>

437
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:36,919
at merit hey could you just put a small

438
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,750
route in route to the null interface for

439
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:42,110
his<font color="#E5E5E5"> network because that would get their</font>

440
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:44,600
attention right and she said<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we</font>

441
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,949
don't really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

442
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:48,199
thing we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a procedure for</font>

443
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing that why don't you talk to Sergio</font>

444
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">hecker at at the John</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> volume</font>

445
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,200
supercomputer center because that's

446
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:56,899
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 112 kilobit circuit to all of</font>

447
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,629
Scandinavia came in so I sent<font color="#E5E5E5"> him an</font>

448
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:01,809
email about it he preferred a more blunt

449
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:04,969
approach he went into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine room</font>

450
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:10,460
where the circuit was located<font color="#E5E5E5"> and put</font>

451
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:14,139
the link in the loop back turning off

452
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,139
connectivity to all of Scandinavia

453
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:22,639
needless to say behavior modification

454
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,399
works and and they didn't bother us

455
00:23:22,639 --> 00:23:28,279
again we had another situation where

456
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:33,620
there was a hacker trying to break in

457
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">and he was on a coming in from address I</font>

458
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,219
turned out back finger worked in those

459
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,470
days you remember finger you can

460
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,879
actually see who was logged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

461
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:43,940
Machine and what jobs they were running

462
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:48,320
and I was clear there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a user on some</font>

463
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:52,129
Apollo workstation at MIT and he was

464
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:54,918
trying to to to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I fired up a</font>

465
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:56,990
talk session I said hey stop doing this

466
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,120
as a US government computer don't mess

467
00:23:56,990 --> 00:24:02,269
around with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it hey why you can't do</font>

468
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,899
anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah blah blah blah so then I</font>

469
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:10,340
informed him that all computers that run

470
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:12,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">tci tcp/ip because it was a DoD protocol</font>

471
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,789
had a special<font color="#E5E5E5"> trap door built into them</font>

472
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:19,400
and if you were to cause a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

473
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:21,080
would if you didn't stop doing this I

474
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:25,190
would exercise the<font color="#CCCCCC"> trapdoor and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

475
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:27,439
your machine out<font color="#E5E5E5"> Inez oh nothing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

476
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:31,580
the Apollo's back in those days had a

477
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:35,929
bug in there colonel and it turned out

478
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:38,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">it believed ICMP messages from anybody</font>

479
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:42,830
that would sent it and we had a little

480
00:24:38,809 --> 00:24:46,370
program that faked ICMP messages so i

481
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:49,730
sent the<font color="#CCCCCC"> machine a ICMP redirect to my</font>

482
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:53,899
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> my host to his loopback address</font>

483
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:56,929
and then issued a flood ping and at that

484
00:24:53,899 --> 00:24:59,709
point the<font color="#E5E5E5"> colonel forward the packets at</font>

485
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:03,529
a colonel priority and panic the machine

486
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:06,140
I was told afterwards that he kept

487
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:09,020
telling people it's true there's a

488
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,669
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> trap door in every network</font>

489
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:16,490
implementation out there that the

490
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:22,970
government can control we also had

491
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:25,390
problems with porn back in those days we

492
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:27,620
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> an appropriate use policy and</font>

493
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:30,350
delivery of<font color="#E5E5E5"> porn across the federal</font>

494
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:33,770
networks was was not considered in

495
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:36,709
compliance with this we had to police it

496
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:39,289
because we didn't want to be hauled<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

497
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:40,760
to the hill saying why is taxpayer money

498
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:44,299
going for the distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

499
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,610
pornography and have our funding cut off

500
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:48,408
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that also our international</font>

501
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:52,610
links were modest in particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> the link</font>

502
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:54,409
to Australia was 112 kilobits and the

503
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:57,139
Aussies were very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> at finding porn</font>

504
00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:59,210
on the internet as it turns out and the

505
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,130
link would red line and then it was oh

506
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:04,130
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> god it's like how are you going to</font>

507
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:06,409
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fortunately I don't think</font>

508
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:09,770
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> knew about this the fix at the</font>

509
00:26:06,409 --> 00:26:11,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">time was a shared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet right so we</font>

510
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,309
had a spark station that was plugged

511
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:15,350
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and we would put it into</font>

512
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:17,360
promiscuous mode the ethernet interface

513
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,280
run TCP dump and we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font>

514
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,918
software that could reassemble the TCP

515
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:24,610
sessions so we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually be able to</font>

516
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,310
see the ftp<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests coming</font>

517
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:29,899
for the file and uh what people would do

518
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:33,560
back in<font color="#E5E5E5"> those days is they would find</font>

519
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:37,160
some server somewhere some<font color="#CCCCCC"> host that had</font>

520
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:39,620
an open ftp server and they would plug

521
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,230
there they would hide porn in

522
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:45,800
directories named dot right and dot dot

523
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:48,290
and stuff like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and so then we would</font>

524
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,760
just call up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> site inform them that</font>

525
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:51,350
they were hosting porn and the get

526
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,620
turned off and the link would go back

527
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:56,540
down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to normal bandwidth occasionally</font>

528
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:01,239
we ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> into problems with universities</font>

529
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:05,149
that did<font color="#E5E5E5"> not want to for various reasons</font>

530
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:09,020
turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I had a friend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mine at</font>

531
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:12,520
Berkeley who would post under the on

532
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:17,870
usenet under the pseudonym red meat and

533
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:21,770
I would have him post the the location

534
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:24,260
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the porn on you on you unit within</font>

535
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:28,460
about 15 minutes the site was totally

536
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:31,610
bashed with<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests and they would then</font>

537
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,920
have to turn it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off in order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

538
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,469
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network congestion these were</font>

539
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:40,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kinds of problems we had back in</font>

540
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:43,490
back in the old days not that we have

541
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:47,419
them today traffic continue to grow and

542
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:50,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> t ones became congested you know we</font>

543
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:53,030
moved from EGP to bgp which was a real

544
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:54,770
routing protocol backbone networks all

545
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:58,070
had to upgrade but the costs were high

546
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:02,660
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> equipment was immature you know</font>

547
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:05,689
the NSF networks with their awarded an

548
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:08,150
upgrade to ANS advanced network and

551
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:18,620
came in up in 1992 we and the folks at

552
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:21,710
es net partnered on a on a procurement

553
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,300
we went to go talk to MCI AT&T and

554
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:28,420
Sprint and worldcom about using either

555
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:30,879
frame relay or ATM as our transport to

556
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:33,350
basically reduce the cost of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

557
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,560
remember a particularly funny

558
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,669
interaction we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the AT&T facility</font>

559
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:41,810
in Warren New Jersey

560
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:44,320
and that's where the gcn s2000 the old

561
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:49,159
ATM switch was was was being built and

562
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:51,740
we we were said you know the handler

563
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:55,610
said you know the food is here breakfast

564
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,810
is over here blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah please don't</font>

565
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:03,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">use the drinking fountains and then</font>

566
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:05,330
moved on so I raised my hand because why

567
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,190
not use the drinking fountains oh we

568
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:11,600
have a groundwater contamination problem

569
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:14,120
here so and moved on and Isis cute me

570
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,290
but but if you have a groundwater

571
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,909
contamination problem why<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you just</font>

572
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:26,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">turn them off oh no they're for the</font>

government contracting we we contracted

in 1991 to allow commercial operators to

something that's controversial people

606
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,650
complain right and so there were a

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,170

635
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:43,000
because we can't get our needs met by

your company<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big problem right</font>

637
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,710
so you know we hadn't thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how</font>

638
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,270
to do this but it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an odd place and so</font>

639
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,450
one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have under</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

Space Act the the enabling legislation

641
00:32:53,450 --> 00:33:01,040
for NASA allowed us to sell time on

642
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,750
unique national facilities this was put

643
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:07,350
in for like launch ranges

644
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:09,150
launch sites wind tunnels etc we would

645
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:11,370
sell time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boeing to test out new</font>

646
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,750
airplanes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> managed to</font>

647
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,840
construct a space act agreement

648
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:20,400
declaring the our telecom facility a

649
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:25,439
unique national asset and this allowed

650
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:27,120
us to sell a access to commercial

651
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,180
entities to the facility on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

652
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">recovery basis so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put up a new</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FDDI</font>

653

ring the government networks were dual

654
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:38,520
home commercial networks would then

655
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:42,500
interconnect on the on the city and and

656
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:44,820
voila we had a working interconnect

657
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,860
eventually lots of people wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

658
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:51,060
attach but our facilities were not big

659
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:53,639
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to house everyone so you know the</font>

00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:56,850
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> east at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the time was operating</font>

661
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,010
really well and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked with with</font>

662
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:02,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the folks at MF s to put a bridged link</font>

in between our facility at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ames and the</font>

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:20,129
connect up at connect up at in san jose

668
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:22,560
and MF s and eventually both the links

669
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:25,230
were upgraded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a 153 at one</font>

here keeping me honest so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted</font>

676
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:45,750
to say at this point you know some new

677
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,990
technologies came out and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

678
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:52,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">has really been riding on the backs of</font>

00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:55,408
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies for some time the net</font>

680
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:58,770
Netscape was formed after mosaic was was

681
00:34:55,409 --> 00:35:00,630
released I am remember you remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

682
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:04,380
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> were old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember when</font>

683
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:06,000
mosaic first came out yeah so I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

684
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,430
phone call from a friend of<font color="#E5E5E5"> mine I was</font>

685
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,370
still at NASA at the time at Berkeley

686
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:15,330
and he said Milo have you seen this

687
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:17,870
thing mosaic ago yeah says you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

688
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,870
stop<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

689
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:24,490
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will fill um you know I work</font>

690
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,980
for government but I don't exactly have

691
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:29,740
the power to do that it goes you have to

692
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:33,610
stop it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go why are you so excited</font>

693
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:36,850
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this don't you understand this</font>

694
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,710
thing allows you to use graphics and all

695
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:43,870
kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things anybody can use it now</font>

696
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:45,580
and it's inefficient because at least

697
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:47,170
with gopher you'd get a link and you

698
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:49,390
download the thing you wouldn't start a

699
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:51,100
download until you guys we got the file

700
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,410
that you wanted this thing you'd be

701
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:56,319
clicking through who knows what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

702
00:35:53,410 --> 00:36:01,350
could you know download<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll destroy</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop it and</font>

704
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:08,020
there's a certain amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of truth into</font>

00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:10,060
that and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to say one of the</font>

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:13,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that we can do is we can throw</font>

707
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,310
bandwidth away or do things that are

708
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:18,160
less efficient from a bandwidth and

709
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:22,330
network perspective to improve user

710
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,670
interface and generate a better

experience that allows users to get

their productivity done in in in better

00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:34,000
ways at<font color="#CCCCCC"> livermore we used to run of a</font>

00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:36,700
craze in interactive mode not batch like

715
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,880
many folks did and and even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

716
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,620
was technically not efficient it was

717
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,600
much more productive because you could

718
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:47,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">see a run going south on you view that</font>

abort the job and then and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and fix</font>

720
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:54,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and and this was the same kind of</font>

721
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:57,880
thing the problem of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course is this feud</font>

722
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:59,649
a massive growth in users devices and

723
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,390
server based applications it really

724
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:06,310
allowed the webbed right allowed

725
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:10,569
computing to move from the edge in into

726
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:13,440
what was then not called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cloud but</font>

727
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:16,510
that's the the ride that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

728
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,090
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that drives the need for</font>

729
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:21,970
bandwidth and dial-up networking at the

730
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,580
time was really not able to sustain the

731
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:27,879
kind of interface and experience that

732
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:30,250
that that the new browser systems wanted

733
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,280
to be able to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

734
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:37,990
the thing that really saved our bacon

735
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:45,130
was DWDM right cost of photonics and the

736
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:48,490
cost of transport allowed dwn allowed

737
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:51,970
that to decline very rapidly and what

738
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:54,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that meant was you're in a system where</font>

739
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:55,569
traffic was growing the next increment

740
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,090
of capacity that you added to your

741
00:37:55,570 --> 00:38:01,690
network was cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last drink</font>

742
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:03,190
event and as long as the next increment

743
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:05,680
is always cheaper than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

744
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,920
increment your average cost keeps

745
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:12,149
declining and so in a system where

746
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,210
volume is growing at an astounding rate

747
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:17,860
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have that dynamic going on</font>

different than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> browsers of of 1996</font>

770
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,350
when I was at Livermore we had a saying

771
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,060
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what language i'll be using</font>

772
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:27,430
in five years but it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be called</font>

773
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:29,500
Fortran and and the similar thing is you

774
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:31,980
know we still call it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a browser but it's</font>

00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:40,720
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very different animal than what it was</font>

00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,920
delivering broadband access using the

and and the browser to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really give</font>

people the ability to use a broadband

advance the ball and I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font>

789

to conclude by saying you know all<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

790
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:31,390
of these trends have continued today

791
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:33,279
DWDM and and photonics continue to

792
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:36,098
deliver more and more capacity at lower

the cost of storage is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also declining it</font>

796
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:47,890
makes it much more cost effective to put

trends continue the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is going to</font>

continue to scale but if dwm stops if

paving the way for new services in the

815
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:45,960
if there's time we could take a few

what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on at the agency yeah so</font>

some<font color="#CCCCCC"> things haven't changed one thing</font>

00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:17,490
that also hasn't changed is some<font color="#E5E5E5"> qos</font>

827
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:20,650
stuff everyone knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like u of s so</font>

828
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:23,890
back in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> old days or the previous</font>

829
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:26,530
days how much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this Q s interest was</font>

830
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:28,870
in prioritizing control protocols not

831
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:32,350
just the application layer 3 and stuff

832
00:42:28,870 --> 00:42:36,460
higher but a EGP itself or things like

833
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:38,440
that uh you know we one of the most

834
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:43,900
famous failures of the ARPANET occurred

835
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,640
because the control traffic was routed

836
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:47,200
at the same priority as data traffic and

837
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:50,560
basically the control system couldn't

838
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,779
couldn't couldn't converge quickly

839
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,900
enough we have had<font color="#E5E5E5"> these kind of</font>

840
00:42:52,780 --> 00:43:00,280
problems for for some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

841
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:03,340

845
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:12,880
qos we don't have the settlement

00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:15,390
arrangements that that can that can work

847
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,920
this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the topics back in the</font>

848
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:19,359
late 80s that everybody was thinking

849
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,340
yeah we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us work we're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">going to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and and because</font>

851
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:27,280
ATM did that and we needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

852
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:31,440
that would do what<font color="#E5E5E5"> ATM did in the</font>
