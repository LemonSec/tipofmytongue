00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:12,150
I'm Miriam<font color="#CCCCCC"> kuna from the ripe NCC and</font>

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,870
the measurements and monitoring

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,639
she was<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing the well</font>

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,100
the sixth day we mentioned a few times

5
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:20,320
yesterday I'm during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel so I</font>

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:21,490
thought it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to just</font>

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,520
give you an impression or give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you an</font>

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:26,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually measured and</font>

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,860
give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> some pointers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where you can</font>

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,380
find more information and we did one

11
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:35,739
thing a few days or like a week before

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:37,720
the world v6 day mostly targeted to end

13
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:39,879
users where they could check if they

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,620
will have problems on the day and we

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:47,379
call that ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> I chart and I'll show you</font>

16
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:50,349
an example we actually fetch some images

17
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:52,480
from servers enough for various

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,899
organizations that wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be listed</font>

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,998
and and you could see if that works if

20
00:00:55,899 --> 00:01:00,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">they view well let me just show you the</font>

21
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:03,280
example in it's easier to explain that

22
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:06,190
would show up on the screen or

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you had no</font>

24
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,050
problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you know witching</font>

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,570
content on unworldly six day for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

26
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,060
that switched on b6 and then there were

27
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:18,580
a few other options<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one could see</font>

28
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,960
in case there were any problems for

29
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,179
instance this one you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have</font>

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,389
been problematic and then you know we

31
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,100
had some descriptions or a little hints

32
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,610
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> under the image what you could</font>

33
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:32,320
do to fix that before the day and then

34
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:35,680
there were some other kind of you know

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,179
mix brokenness like where the energies I

36
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,920
couldn't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done anything but you know</font>

37
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:43,600
should probably contact the provider and

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,090
yeah that was there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was the</font>

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,660
one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still running people can</font>

40
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:51,940
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to that site and see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if they</font>

41
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:56,470
have any problems reaching other sites

42
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:58,960
on v6 and we will we'll keep that

43
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:01,179
running I think for a while another

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,639
thing we've done with them just before

45
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:06,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">World v6 day and then during</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these 24</font>

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:08,619
hours and we measured or we checked if

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,628
like who said on their<font color="#E5E5E5"> career records</font>

48
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:13,360
and a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you can see that looks</font>

49
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:16,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">better than on my screen here basically</font>

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">the the green in the middle that's kind</font>

51
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:22,209
of the data it's on 8 of June and you go

52
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,739
to the to that side you see little time

53
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,740
slider underneath

54
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,150
can you can look back in time and you

55
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,660
can see here quite nicely of people

56
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:33,640
switched on v6 and icon um midnight UTC

57
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,500
and then most people switch it off again

58
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,570
and but you can also see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

59
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,720
organizations kept running after 8th of

60
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">June so I'm dead still on the website vm</font>

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,109
stopped collecting that data but you can

62
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,930
still see what happened during the<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

63
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:49,630
and we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> see it just as a snapshot</font>

64
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:51,190
here we could see some we are

65
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,500
interesting things happening just before

66
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,150
for instance some people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of switch</font>

67
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,570
it on and off<font color="#CCCCCC"> and on and often reluctant</font>

68
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,590
kind of testing before they actually

69
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,209
switched it on @midnight and yeah we

70
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,450
could see some other interesting things

71
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:10,120
like the google site<font color="#CCCCCC"> XM of augmented 2.0</font>

72
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:15,100
whitelisted and others weren't and so we

73
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,540
didn't see anything there yes that's

74
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,700
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much that's what we've done is</font>

75
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,790
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an explanation of that chart I just</font>

76
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:24,130
showed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we how we measured</font>

77
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and then also we're going to do</font>

78
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">some more analysis of the data that we</font>

79
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,030
collected and we will put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on web</font>

80
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:33,370
labs and the all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the measurements are on</font>

81
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that website there at the bottom that I</font>

82
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:37,570
showed you before and just at the end

83
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:40,870
just one other thing also on that side

84
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:42,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's it looks like this I just</font>

85
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,280
thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty picture I wanted</font>

86
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:47,950
to show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know</font>

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,110
DNS mon<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns monitoring system at the</font>

88
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:52,630
ripe NCC is providing that works very

89
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,940
similar here just did it doesn't connect

90
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:58,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers but took HTTP servers and</font>

91
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:01,450
so all our vantage points like all the

92
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,950
measurement boxes we have out there they

93
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:07,000
were looking after could reach those

94
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:10,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">tt-this HTTP servers and depending on on</font>

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,550
that each sub<font color="#E5E5E5"> T cells add a little color</font>

96
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:16,870
color code and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see on the on the</font>

97
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:18,940
side how how the changes over time so

98
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,530
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say actually all i wanted to show</font>

99
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,870
you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give you an impression of</font>

100
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,960
what we've been measuring on the day

101
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:29,070
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> Corday's and and the HTTP and</font>

102
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,430
then we also provided this<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye chart</font>

103
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,080
for users to check if they will be

104
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,680
archived on you if they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see any</font>

105
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:46,109
problems on the day and then that's it

106
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:55,760
any questions website again<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank</font>

107
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:55,760
you thank you all right

108
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,440
here

109
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:18,449
okay next<font color="#E5E5E5"> up is Manish hi I'm manish</font>

110
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,149

I'll be talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> today is network</font>

112
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:26,399
reputation and in particular what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

113
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:28,319
doing to build towards a network

114
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,270
reputation in particular where we're

115
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,639
starting from and what our early results

116
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:34,859
are once again this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really early work</font>

117
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,249
hence the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lightning talk so feedback</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

118
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,449
very very welcome let's start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

119
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:41,729
introduction and motivation these are

120
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:43,349
the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard problems how do you</font>

121
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:45,628
create incentives<font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to run</font>

122
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,159
clean networks how do you measure the

123
00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:49,319
relative security posture of a given

124
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:50,938
<font color="#CCCCCC">network how do you balance the need to</font>

125
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,529
communicate with<font color="#CCCCCC"> another network with</font>

126
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:56,430
the risk because inherently there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

risk more more interestingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you</font>

128
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:00,509
estimate the likelihood of a future

00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,819
attack or future malicious activity from

130
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,279
a network given historical data or

131
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:09,740
current data can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you assign a risk</font>

133
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,219
but what would<font color="#E5E5E5"> help what would help is</font>

134
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:17,909
if you had some historical and current

135
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:20,219
notion of the behavior of a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

136
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:21,959
a security perspective some some notion

137
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,389
of reputation so that's that's what

138
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:25,919
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get at that's the goal</font>

139
00:06:23,389 --> 00:06:27,599
what are the properties well we know one

140
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,580
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you should not do is</font>

141
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,169
rely on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a single source</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of data because</font>

00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,789
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your reputation results will</font>

143
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,469
be biased towards a single type of

144
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,889
activity so you have to have diverse

00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:40,949
data sources bgp dns email anything else

146

of a central collation agency which

they're generally published by a third

201
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:54,950
party and you have lots of hosts and

202
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,540
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what these reports are</font>

203

indicators of<font color="#CCCCCC"> host reputation and what</font>

204
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,959
we do from these is try to seed the

honest reports and disincentives for

211
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,300
people to lie and this is where we're

212
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:16,830
hoping we're going to leverage some

213

background from mechanism design and

214
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,830
game theory to set the right incentives

215
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,770
in the system so that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not easy to</font>

216
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,290
gain here's an example of finally what

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,970
it'll look like the prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> will all</font>

every single prefix in the bgp table

00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:36,300
will have a reputation score from 1 to

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:38,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">100 and basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what you will be able</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

224
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,620
this reputation what could you do with

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:51,850
it well for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> for bgp you could</font>

226
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:55,120
compute paths for each s path you could

compute a relative reputation score for

it reliability or risk metric if you

229
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,590
want to call it that and then you could

230
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,969
set<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp policy saying i don't want my</font>

packets to go through a bad neighborhood

232
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:09,250
or I want them to prefer this other path

233
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:12,220
based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on my analysis of how well these</font>

236
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,800
extent maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could tweak it a little</font>

237
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,260
by using network level information as

238
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,939
well inbound firewalls could be much

239
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,040
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a single accept or drop</font>

240
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:27,850
rule you could have gray scale so you

241
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,880
could say maybe send this so maybe drop

242
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:32,800
everything that's in the top worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5% in</font>

243
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,560
the next ten percent maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will send</font>

244
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,939
them to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dpi box and in pain will close</font>

245
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,099
attention to that traffic where's

246
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,630
everything that's in the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten</font>

247
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,640
percent I'm going to just pass it

248
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:46,450
through to my to my regular servers

249
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,100
applications could make use a reputation

250
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">as well for example your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a bank</font>

251
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,600
you could say well I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to block</font>

252
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,760
the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> five percent the next twenty</font>

253
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,990
percent I'm going to send to a site

254
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,420
which requires two factor authentication

255
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:00,610
and the the rest don't need it because I

256
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:03,160
trust those networks so there's so if

257
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,200
you have this information<font color="#CCCCCC"> it enables a</font>

258
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,410
whole range of activities which are much

259
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,570
harder to do right now so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's talk</font>

260
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how weird bootstrapping the system</font>

261
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:16,950
right now we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with lots of</font>

262
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:19,420
third-party data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> BRB l xbl spam cop</font>

263
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,490
they're all the spam data types then the

<font color="#E5E5E5">of course drone be else they all all</font>

271
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:39,219
these lists have different magnitudes in

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,290
terms of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many IPS are on those and</font>

273
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,210
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do is we take those and try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

274
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,500
bucket them into prefixes and try to

275
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:49,060
derive reputation scores based on those

276
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,190
not sure if the lines are very visible

277
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,520
on this graph but essentially what we're

278
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,160
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

279
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,360
is that all these are BLS when you

280
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,949
assign when you take all these

281
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,340
individual IP addresses you just put

282
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:02,860
them in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> bucket than my prefixes you</font>

283
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:06,190
can get some notion of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many IPS in</font>

284
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,020
each prefix are on our BLS and then you

285
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,490
can sort of derive a relative dirty or

286
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:11,860
clean this off for<font color="#E5E5E5"> network this is a</font>

330

account when we wait reputation for

00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,630
networks here's an example of the BRIC

countries for example in in half and

333
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,520
they show up in

334
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,140
in these different lists and now what I

335
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to quickly get to was an example</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">where we're building a reputation score</font>

337
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,720
if we take just three data sources and

338
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,670
we wait them all evenly this is the

339
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,710
percentage of and we build them

340
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:20,110
basically on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the percentage of the total</font>

342
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:25,540
these lists you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can come up with some</font>

343
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,880
scoring or reputation index and here I'm

344
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">just presenting three data sources the</font>

345
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:33,400
top<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten lists and roughly resolving them</font>

346
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:35,500
to where their locations are<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's</font>

347
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,319
hard to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say whether this is definitive</font>

348
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,880
proof of reputation or not but it's sort

349
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,380
of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build that and once you</font>

350
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,030
have prefix level of reputation which

351
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,070
you can then do is you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can build a</font>

352
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:47,740
notion of a s level reputation by

353
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,690
aggregating across all prefixes and and

354
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:52,060
here's the swing shot from our prototype

355
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:56,590
system well off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top 25 worst</font>

356
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:58,270
reputation asses so conclusion the goal

357
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,920
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network repetitions really is to</font>

358
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,500
create some<font color="#E5E5E5"> some sort of a predictive</font>

indicator of how well a network is run

360
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:07,360
and then allow for security policies

361
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:10,000
that take that into account the relative

362
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,830
likelihood of a future malicious

363
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,020
activity from a network if you have this

364
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,940
information you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for for</font>

00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,230
making sound policy decisions that

policy decisions this is still work in

progress so comments are welcome Michael

Sinatra yes net I said some of this

370
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:34,390
yesterday I'll just say it again first

371

376
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:50,770

get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> endless discussions about the</font>

careful of course to the extent that you

382
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,500
make that more and more transparent

383
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:04,510
you're going to get into more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more</font>

discussions to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent you</font>

385
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,800
make it more and more opaque people will

386
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:12,430
trust it less so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a difficult</font>

387
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,660
tightrope to walk and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be a</font>

388
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,359
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit careful about how you use</font>

389
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,209
game theory since it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

390
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,890
it's a modeling method<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and most</font>

391
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:21,029
game theorists will not call themselves

392
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:23,670
game theorists they call themselves

393
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:26,579
formal modelers as someone who used to

394
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,019
do that work and so the important thing

395
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:31,349
is that the theory<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind it is good</font>

396
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:33,420
okay thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so it's a good point that</font>

397
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,399
and I do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to clarify on the game</font>

398
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,599
theory part we were warned against going

399
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,279
game theory because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a game</font>

400
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,480
inherently what we want to do is a

401
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,269
derivative of game theory which is

402
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,860
mechanism design and what we're hoping

403
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,870
is that that will give us a theoretical

404
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,700
background for incentive setting and how

405
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:51,240
the incentive should be weighted in the

406
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:52,920
system to get honest feedback in but the

407
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,050
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the theory part and</font>

408
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:57,120
not the method you're using to derive it

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:02,160

was<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious are you getting your</font>

412
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:08,220

413

or you breaking them down to the 24 so

00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,630
if your rating on what you're learning

415

with just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few hits you would end up</font>

00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:23,130
and causing adverse traffic flows to

but in your kind of method it looks like

a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our prefixes which is always be</font>

the the way we wait the prefect prefixes

of the reputation of a network is really

432

how as a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> the total possible hosts</font>

malicious activity of one form or

00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,950
another this can also be weighted in

different ways if you're doing SSH force

00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:05,040
break-ins well maybe you want to wait

438
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,850
that data more rather than spams because

439
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,168
we know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very reliable so yes</font>

440
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,659
there are different<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways of waiting it</font>

441
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:15,480
our initial system does do purely a

442
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:18,929
density of how full your network was in

443
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,970
terms of badness people have chris's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nos</font>

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,370
afterwards you can talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

447
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,999
sorry Chris I missed the beginning did

448
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:33,759
you say how I can get access to this

449
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:37,730
data or house with good access data and

450
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:39,590
the format in which the data comes we

451
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:41,450
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not publicly released the website</font>

452
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,340
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can share that with you and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font>

453
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,529
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it offline but but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

454
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,779
eventually once we have a reasonable

455
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:50,179
system built we do met intend to just

456
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:53,779
distributed over XML or or you know

457
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:55,580
download it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah so it seems like</font>

458
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:57,860
this again we have the scheduler

459
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,059
yesterday but the sort of making the

460
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:00,830
data available in a fashion that

461
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:02,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">enterprise folks could make use of it I</font>

462
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't necessarily think that the is it a</font>

463
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,860
/ 15 that got you know thrown away is a

464
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:11,350
problem for the enterprise people as

465
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:18,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">much as it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is for for isp people okay</font>

466
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:20,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so thank you and next up and I</font>

467
00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:24,190
say you can grab them off the deciding

468
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:24,190
always next<font color="#E5E5E5"> up is Anton</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lately was prompted by a</font>

taken upon ourselves to look at more

measurements more available data that we

475
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,070
can chew through and think about and so

476
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">today we're talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some work that</font>

we're doing an ongoing work<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

that's already begun<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at roughly</font>

479
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:11,640
what's what's really happening in

<font color="#CCCCCC">mobility</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of usable and</font>

available performance and specifically

482
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:20,250
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that compare to cellular</font>

483
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:22,110
performance and we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to start with</font>

484
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,640
one of the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not best but I</font>

485
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,260
shouldn't qualify it like that i should

486
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,850
say one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most prolific data</font>

487
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,370

speedtest.net who's from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> with speed</font>

understand what's going on on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

493
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:49,679
connection and the thought we were

494
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,389
starting with<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this work was what is</font>

495
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,580
the real difference between someone who

496
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,800
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> rooted on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a Wi-Fi type connection or</font>

497
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,970
someone who's using purely mobile

498
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:03,330
cellular connections so we started to

499
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:05,130
process this data in a short what this

500
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,720
stuff really amounts to is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> combination</font>

501
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:09,870
of some javascript and flash

502
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,460
applications that seek to do basic

503
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,459
upstream downstream assessments as well

504
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,620
as some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time people who</font>

505
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,850
operate servers people who providers

506
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,280
rather who operate the speedtest.net

507
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,260
servers which are publicly listed in a

508
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,180
database are provided the table you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

509
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,400
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom it may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be easy to see</font>

510
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,530
but the general idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that a server</font>

511
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,850
operator understands who's hitting it

512
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:34,080
through the eyes of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> data source and</font>

through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of an EDI or web</font>

519
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,190
or cities and after some

520
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,420
agreements were signed you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have far</font>

521
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,700
more data than your server itself

00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,010
provides you see here that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

523
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,950
general things like platform the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:09,310
up downstream bit rates wait and see and

527
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:11,620
most importantly for our work here the

528
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,270
location in in space will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:22,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">and most importantly connection type</font>

532
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:26,710
cellular or Wi-Fi the two shown here of

533
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:28,300
course are not on Wi-Fi so that's that's

534
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,040
kind of a top level but really we

535
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,899
started a scratch below the surface a

536
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,490
bit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that speedtest.net in</font>

537
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:36,190
fact is powered by cats like much of the

538
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:38,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the application you will see</font>

539
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:42,600
this and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it perhaps is the</font>

540
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:45,550
whimsy that carries the<font color="#E5E5E5"> app on the air</font>

541
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,860
general methodology is that measurements

542
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:49,540
are done against<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server from the</font>

543
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,240
client through the process you see here

00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,550
first a couple round-trip texts attempts

545
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,710
are made over<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> socket that essentially</font>

546
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:58,780
passes basic headers and nothing more

547
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,960
that's repeated<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a number of times and</font>

548
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,490
then gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to estimate and then</font>

549
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally execute the bulk of the</font>

repeated for post methods in the

00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:27,310
schedule schedule schedule where we led

559
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,889
the behavior that<font color="#CCCCCC"> could mislead the</font>

560
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,720
client with regards to exactly how much

561
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,940
data was in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> received or sent over</font>

562
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:36,910
the network layer and then that final

563
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:39,520
result is average and reported to the

564
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,740
server so an example server running in

565
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,440
Madison Wisconsin which is a small

<font color="#E5E5E5">region rate tends to attract clients</font>

567
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,330
from areas you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far east as</font>

568
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:52,480
perhaps milwaukee<font color="#CCCCCC"> in chicago and as far</font>

569
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:54,850
west as Dubuque Iowa and parts into

northern northeastern Iowa and Eastern

571
00:23:54,850 --> 00:24:00,280
Minnesota and the resulting traffic you

572
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:02,760
see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not huge but for such a</font>

573
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:05,080
small market surprisingly peaky

574
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,920
diurnal of course weighted towards the

<font color="#CCCCCC">afternoon and at no time do we see any</font>

single tasks doing more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font>

577
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,860
hundred megabits so surprising result we

578
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:17,680
thought we'd see people with very<font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">speed connections pegging it for regular</font>

we thought the ratios would be different

635
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,419
so sites that verizon or sprint or

00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:36,529
anybody else has enabled yet we expect

637
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:38,789
to see this trend shift as that happens

638
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:40,559
so comparing Wi-Fi and cellular of

639
00:26:38,789 --> 00:26:42,840
course the intuition hold and it's true
