54
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:49,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">my cursor over there somewheres and i</font>

55
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:56,830
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to do a show I PBG pgp</font>

56

00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:14,500
have your bgp pairings right there show

58
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:20,140
IP bgp summaries yes you will do and no

59
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:22,440
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not super user sooo do get me a</font>

60
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,440
sandwich

61
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:35,849
so everybody have their<font color="#CCCCCC"> nie Spierings</font>

62
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:37,530
with those two external routers so let's

63
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:43,380
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out where I was supposed to be</font>

64
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:47,698
here that looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so you want to</font>

65
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:53,270
configure this juniper don't start

66
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,270
typing this in Cisco you want to

67
00:05:53,509 --> 00:06:03,509
configure your rpki server you'll need

68
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> compte you'll have</font>

69
00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:09,150
first you'll have to know what you're a

70
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:17,609
s number is and it's closely related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

71
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:26,909
your user number it's 65 1 x.x<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and</font>

72
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:30,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">then you type this line except here it</font>

73
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:34,729
is that's the theory up top and this is

74
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:41,340
the practice down below so you type

75
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:44,550
router bgp 65 65 1 x.x bgp rpki server

76
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,229
and select the port etcetera juniper

77
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,659
folk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have to type all that</font>

78
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:54,469
garbage oops there's a cheat sheet that

79
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:54,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can cut and paste</font>

80
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:27,739
is there a cisco router geek who's not

81
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:29,360
he's would you help Russ because he can

82
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,090
type the stuff on the screen but their

83
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,740
stuff missing from the screen thinner

84
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:39,380
what are you doing here Fenner's not

85
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:42,070
good enough I didn't recognize you<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

86
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,070
you know why

87
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:14,279
so anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else need help sir</font>

88
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:42,000

101
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:54,709

102
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:57,590
Warren<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to look up Warren</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

103
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to look up juniper folk look at the</font>

104
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:02,270
slides for sect you won't you want to do

105
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:09,740
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> things two of them are in that</font>

106
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:14,050
cheat sheet<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones policy ones routing</font>

107
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:22,550
options and the third is apply the

108
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:24,800
policy none of it comes you come

109
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:27,170
configured with vgb because there's no

110
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,209
sense teaching you how to use bgp but

111
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,599
your router's do not come pre-configured

112
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:34,400
with this stuff for rpki based origin

113
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:45,890
validation because that's what the

114
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:48,350
workshops about pardon oh pardon load

115
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:52,550
merge term yeah I try to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fairly</font>

116
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:55,430
easy I'm watch out though in the load

117
00:10:52,550 --> 00:11:04,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">merged term the very easy i made it you</font>

118
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:06,319
mean to deal with local address because

119
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,170
well normally it would work in real

120
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:13,210
routers but internally inside this we're

121
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:15,890
using net 10 and so it's unreachable and

122
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:19,850
so it could accidentally pick the wrong

123
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,920
source one is the one it's talking to

124
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:24,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's the internal bgp peers it's your</font>

125
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,430
internal network the border routers and

126
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:28,980
the external address is a real

127
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,250
external address a true global address

128
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:36,050
you can ping home if you want I don't

129
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:40,589
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put DNS servers in there but</font>

130
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:50,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're welcome to do that we will hose</font>

131
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:54,330
it all out after you play<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

132
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:59,180
juniper users when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> through you</font>

133
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:03,720
should be able to do this command show

134
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:08,370
validation session brief and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

135
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:13,620
see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually are paired with a</font>

136
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:16,830
cache server you are and then you should

137
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:28,830
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to zoo show validation database</font>

138
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:30,690
brief then I don't leave I hope that you

139
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:33,120
lied to me that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you said show</font>

140
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:38,850
validation session brief showed the

141
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:41,959
seishin state as up then then you have

142
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,959
not configured properly

143
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:53,010
I don't know what you left out there

144
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:57,480
with I'll again once again there are

145
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:59,930
three things the routing policy which

146
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,610
you can cut this<font color="#CCCCCC"> knife from the web page</font>

147

observe the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> line of</font>

that slide local address yes yeah yeah

149
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:20,580
well I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I'd want to cut and</font>

150
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:22,920
paste<font color="#CCCCCC"> that line well I I set you up for</font>

151
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,839
problems in the text file that you're

152
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:31,770
cutting and pasting from that's in

153
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:34,620
comment braces<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay then policy and then</font>

154
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:39,120
apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> the policy and then check the</font>

155
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:44,010
server<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay sis codes you just have one</font>

156
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:47,339
line that line EG<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peaks bar pki server</font>

157
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:52,610
and now you can check how your server is

158
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:52,610
going show I PBG rpki servers

159
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:45,600
unknown oh you're you guys aren't

160
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:53,100
running ahead a little are you okay so

161
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:55,499
who hasn't who cannot see a database who

162
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,290
has not got a database up in other words

163
00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:05,610
you got a good connection<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a server</font>

164
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:10,199
yeah that figures you know how to find

165
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:15,749
your source<font color="#CCCCCC"> Warren just show int terse</font>

166
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:27,299
and they'll be one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 147 28</font>

169
00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be fun a router compared with</font>

multiple caches at the same time no no

171
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,379
no I understand your question that is

172
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,149
not local preference<font color="#E5E5E5"> does rather</font>

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:02,939
preferences if it loses connection with

176
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,919
somebody it starts at the highest

177
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:08,189
preference that it hasn't felt a

178
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:16,049
connection to and tries it it just

<font color="#E5E5E5">caches in order of preference yeah that</font>

180
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:22,949
little come along eventually i'm having

187
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:45,839
there's a whole thing if you'll read the

188
00:16:44,939 --> 00:16:48,870
document

189
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,310
internet-draft on rpki router where you

190
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,920
can have some multiple sessions up to

191
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:55,439
multiple caches if it fails here's what

192
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,790
you do how you can restart<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the</font>

193
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">things I didn't tell you about in the</font>

194
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:03,000
rpki router protocol is that there's the

195
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,669
serial number but if the TCP session

196
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,319
fails and I go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to restart you've got a</font>

198
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,040
do I know you didn't also<font color="#E5E5E5"> restart how do</font>

199
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:14,879
I know they're commensurate how I know

200
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">is we've also exchanged a nonce a just</font>

201
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,890
random number 32 bits and if you still

202
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,980
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one and I've still got the</font>

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,930
matching other half of the dollar bill

204
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:28,970
then our serial numbers are commensurate

205
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:38,820
and we can resume so TCP can break

206
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:39,750
sessions restart etc sir how much

implementation Rob how much kids well

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,290
first of all that's implementation

210
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,650
dependent the cash must hold at least an

hour<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it is specified in the</font>

an hour but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in fact Rob probably keeps a</font>

215
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:12,600
horribly long amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cash sorry how</font>

216
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:16,230
much cash do you keep rpk<font color="#CCCCCC"> write a</font>

protocol how much history you got I come

218
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:22,470
back two hours later with a serial

219
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:24,890

221
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:31,200
that's it that's adjustable but i think

222
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">we decided that it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worth saving</font>

223
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,690
longer than that because of what the

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,830
requirements are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocol for how</font>

often you you're supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull</font>

226
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:47,408
yes that guy you hand me the serial

00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:50,570
number and I hit hand you back a um

228
00:18:47,409 --> 00:18:52,990
what's the hand man there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> cash reset</font>

229
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,158
i think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the name of the thing yeah</font>

230
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:56,600
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> written in fact if you look at</font>

the internals of the code it says X for

an expert old beat dms geeks die hard

233

he's I'm kind of curious about coming

234
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:14,960
from post that is a power-on self-test

up to up to fully loaded right up to

236
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:22,909
fully loaded I guess starting so no

237
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:24,918
nobody's unknown well have you tested

238
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:29,179

them up the routers we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

doing that yet want to play sure the

other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in terms of in terms of</font>

251
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:07,039
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can router should start</font>

252
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:10,220
with everybody's unknown because they

253
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,260
are right and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you deal with that</font>

254
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,470
policy wise because that's your choice

255
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:18,200
but the policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i suggest you start</font>

is an idea occurred to me I've kept my

261
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:41,990
mouth shut about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so far is one policy</font>

policy set with I've got a first load

264
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:53,539
okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> but are you implying coming from no</font>

265
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:55,669
implementation toward global acceptance

266
00:20:53,539 --> 00:20:59,210
of this are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talking about what outer</font>

single rider coming up from<font color="#CCCCCC"> fam abou you</font>

268
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,149
might want to have two different

yet yeah okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you stop with just</font>

down proofing things that are unknown

when you walk through and they said and

become valid then you up<font color="#E5E5E5"> riff them and</font>

281
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:42,350
you know they get preferred so as long

as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not dropping them completely</font>

283
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:48,709
stuff still works and works in sort of a

284
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:50,240
same way stuff that's unknown is still

285
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,950
kind of usable stuff that somebody has

286

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,889
misunderstood your question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

289
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,689
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think would be the normal I expect</font>

290
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:05,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to be the normal configuration is</font>

291
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:09,860
that you know as I said the policy i

292
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:18,408
expect people to have is valid yes give

293
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:20,959
them up<font color="#E5E5E5"> ref not known boo invalid at</font>

294
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:24,559
boot time the router starts off with

295
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,970
everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> is unknown um I'm after that I</font>

296
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,190
mean what I'm what I was going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font>

297
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,980
about was that if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you had this</font>

298
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:34,700
scenario where you're down prepping some

299
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:38,840
of these routes do you have due cause

300
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:45,260
some route searching that is not this

301
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:48,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't rpki specific yeah I get that you</font>

302
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,690
are correct no no no just that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

303
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:53,720
correct you start off with everything

304
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:57,799
not known you have essentially today's

305
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">table right you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get in a row that makes</font>

306
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:02,150
somebody

307
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:05,300
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> up prep them all of a sudden they</font>

308
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:09,610
could win where they'd lost before right

309
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:13,490
and indeed that would cause out thrash

310
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:15,830
and when you process me that's it that

311
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:18,740
could cause a new best time process all

312
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:20,750
the RPG I stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to really run</font>

313
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:24,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">pumpkin looking at the bigger picture</font>

314
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:30,350
again if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start out where we up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pref</font>

315
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:32,210
valid and down pref not found that would

316
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,129
be an incentive to some transport

317
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:35,870
providers to not play the game so they

318
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:39,110
would be not found and their paths would

319
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:42,080
not be used what we probably need to do

320
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:44,600
is go to the people who mediate peering

321
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,750
and make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you want to be up</font>

322
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,770
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to play the game oops</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

323
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:55,429
don't need this money I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got my own um</font>

324
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:59,179
what just amazes me about that is when

325
00:23:55,429 --> 00:24:02,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">you hear showering on Tuesday note that</font>

326
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:05,270
her in the base of all her models and

327
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:09,350
her attacks are people trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to attract</font>

328
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:11,960
traffic providers trying to be bigger by

329
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,780
having more traffic not by shedding

330
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:18,650
traffic in fact there are both

331
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:24,980
motivations out there all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right in fact</font>

332
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:26,540
they're both motivations may be a good

333
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing to do would be to say I won't</font>

334
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:35,780
appear with you unless you play the

335
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:36,980
validation game totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> different more</font>

336
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:42,379
like what we were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before I</font>

337
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,850
think Tony<font color="#CCCCCC"> tauber the if you have a less</font>

338
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,620
specific prefix and then somebody

339
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:48,320
advertises it more specific so you've

340
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,600
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean you're not really comparing</font>

341
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,200
apples to apples in the route table so

342
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,600
what happens row if I have a good eye

343
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,590
color recovering row of<font color="#CCCCCC"> four sixteen</font>

344
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:04,790
somebody tries to announce to 24 that is

345
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:07,909
invalid listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it just gets</font>

346
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,770
thrown out I mean the policy would

347
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:11,770
expect

348
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:14,020
a policy to throw out in valence right

349
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:16,930
so so if you raise your policy that

350
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,540
doesn't that keeps it with less

351
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:21,160
preference it will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

352
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:24,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could do that yeah you could also</font>

353
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,420
smoke cigarettes yeah

354
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,540
yep

355
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:43,250
everybody who's playing have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font>

356
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:52,679
didn't go boom so let's go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back a little</font>

357
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:56,040
just on this screen and start playing

358
00:25:52,680 --> 00:26:00,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the GUI you now have a GUI count</font>

359
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:02,010
and our GUI friends here should have

360
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:04,620
fixed your accounts up for you while

361
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:11,370
we're at break and you should see that

362
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:13,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a resource everybody in their</font>

363
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:23,280
gooeys and everybody see the resource in

364
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:27,930
their buoys does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody not see the</font>

365
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:32,750
resource in their gooeys so see where

366
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:32,750
that finger points click it please

367
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:42,650
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> laughing back there I see you</font>

368
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and that takes you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the view of</font>

369
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:57,149
that prefix and that prefix is

370
00:26:52,830 --> 00:27:00,780
unallocated etc etc and see where the

371
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:03,960
finger points if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> click that you can</font>

372
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:12,120
issue a row up for that prefix which you

373
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:23,880
have pardoned you have a sub allocation

374
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:27,959
oh you made it you did it on there come

375
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:32,760
on folks play nice that's why they're

376
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:34,830
laughing back there god it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

377
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:39,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">goddesses revenge I used to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

378
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:44,689
back of the classroom<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so clean up</font>

379
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:44,689
the mess you made apologize<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

380
00:27:51,460 --> 00:28:00,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so we want to issue a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> row if you up</font>

381
00:27:55,990 --> 00:28:05,830
I'm gonna cheat here and go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

382
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:08,080
bunch of ways just so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and just I</font>

383
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:11,529
went back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this slide so you see the</font>

384
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:15,100
two guesses that are interesting you can

385
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:19,870
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> different is as if you want but I</font>

386
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:23,020
suggest you choose one of 41 28 and 31

387
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:24,939
30 because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's being announced from</font>

388
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,129
both so when you look at your router's

389
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,039
you'll see whichever one<font color="#CCCCCC"> you did not</font>

390
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:33,190
choose as an attacker and whichever one

391
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,779
you did choose was the valid one which

392
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:38,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to be the point of the whole</font>

393
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:42,850
exercise so the upper little finger

394
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,189
shows you where to type the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS number</font>

395
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:47,770
which is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the valide s number</font>

396
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:53,110
because you are going to issue a route

397
00:28:47,770 --> 00:29:01,918
origin not a station all think whatever

398
00:28:53,110 --> 00:29:01,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">whoa ah I never remember it and then</font>

399
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:15,250
whoa whoa that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was heavy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

400
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,960
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in the max leg and the</font>

401
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,120
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of whether to put in max</font>

402
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,309
lengths<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not as interesting and we can</font>

403
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,029
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> it some time and then you hit the</font>

404
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:30,760
submit query button and you should see

405
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:35,520
something wonderful like this and you

406
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:39,929
have now issued a row and that Rolla is

407
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,789
wandering around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet somewheres</font>

408
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:46,809
you know it's you you've just done it

409
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:51,190
here and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> being issued and it's</font>

410
00:29:46,809 --> 00:29:53,230
being published and this probably is

411
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:55,990
cycling once every two<font color="#CCCCCC"> or three minutes</font>

412
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then your router cycling every</font>

413
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:01,360
couple of minutes so it could take up to

414
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:02,630
five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes to get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the router but</font>

415
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember</font>

416
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:11,610
you know how to look in the router by

417
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:14,090
seeing if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rola has appeared in</font>

418
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the table</font>

419
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:30,760
okay so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see when you're rola has</font>

420
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:37,210
appeared in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> table for your cute</font>

421
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:44,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">little prefix and it'll take a couple of</font>

422
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:48,400
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from being bored</font>

423
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:52,030
in those couple minutes I said a<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment</font>

424
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:57,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago that the discussion of using max</font>

425
00:30:52,030 --> 00:31:00,129
length is interesting and it turns out

426
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:03,220
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the software i think ap</font>

427
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:05,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">nicks was for v4 prefixes was</font>

428
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,380
automatically doing a max length of 32

429
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:11,590
if you didn't specify it what happens

430
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:17,590
let's say you have a 16 and you use a

431
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:20,860
max length of 24 this whole thing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

432
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:26,320
said in the beginning of the first

433
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:31,270
lecture has the vulnerability that I can

434
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:36,310
fake my a s in other words you just

435
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:40,030
issued a row<font color="#CCCCCC"> of four 4128 I could pray</font>

436
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:42,669
to router with a fake a s of 4128 stick

437
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:46,450
my a relay s on the front<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and go</font>

438
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:50,410
out there and steal the packets because

439
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:53,680
this is not cryptographically signed now

440
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:55,750
the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that problem the</font>

441
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:59,590
malicious attacker will talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

442
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:03,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tuesday but for the moment let's assume</font>

443
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:05,020
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sixth row of four</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sixteen and I slice it up into</font>

445
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:11,860
twenty-fours somebody could use that

446
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:16,300
attack on any of the 24s faking my a s

447
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:21,719
number if I issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 16 with a max</font>

448
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:24,419

450
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,430
describing this attack so I advise you

451
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:34,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you're not going to chop your world</font>

452
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:35,080
up into twenty-fours then don't do a

453
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,960
match

454
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,279
one of 24 and then if somebody wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,289
attack they're going to have to attack

456
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:47,740
the whole 16 and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to notice</font>

457
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:51,039
that real quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so don't get</font>

more if not clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to validation he may</font>

466
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,960
still have that bug I did the Juniper

to get him to refresh it won't do any

474
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:06,900
damage anyway it'll just speed<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

476
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:13,050
validation saw especially soft inbound

477
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:29,279
hey what's your 17 is 17 published who

478
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:33,969
has seen their stuff appear in the cash

479
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:38,760
there we go Frank anybody else the

480
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:38,759
giggle squad in the back nope bummer

481
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,830
garden

482
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:22,740
it'll be a second we know where the

483
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:27,629
problem is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you yep the current code</font>

484
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:32,910
that Rob has for fetching and creating a

485
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:35,510
valid cash is goes one at a time so if

486
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:38,549
it hits one server<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's in bad shape</font>

487
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:40,890
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sits there for two minutes banging</font>

488
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,810
its head against that stupid server he's

489
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:49,850
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle of writing parallel fetch</font>

490
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:49,850
code but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bad server out there</font>

491
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,810
I'm not naming names Michael even though

492
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,390
the person<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the bad servers in the</font>

493
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:02,390
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> they know it already</font>

494
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:26,558
<font color="#E5E5E5">show us steep is not the state that's</font>

495
00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:29,078
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> funny no it's not the prefix state</font>

496
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:33,549
i'm not exactly positive what that state

497
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:37,749
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i believe what it is is he has</font>

498
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:41,019
different states for rowers whether he's

499
00:36:37,749 --> 00:36:45,129
got it hot and fresh whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> old</font>

500
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:49,299
and questionable etc etc I believe

501
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:56,259
that's what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing he's got on us</font>

502
00:36:49,299 --> 00:36:59,319
has a whole lot more state for vote for

503
00:36:56,259 --> 00:37:04,890
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the caches that he makes</font>

504
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:04,890
visible then the cisco implementer does

505
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:12,239
you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong there we go rowers</font>

506
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,239
should start popping up

507
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,480
now everybody can see everybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else's</font>

508
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:34,050
rose so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just show that you can tell</font>

509
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:36,750
who's up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is who's 18 I don't</font>

510
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,880
know there we go Frank making<font color="#E5E5E5"> trouble he</font>

511
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:46,850
made trouble last week in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reykjavik too</font>

512
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:50,970
he's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a troublemaker pardon</font>

513
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:56,509
everybody's<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's go to the</font>

514
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:59,430
next wonderful thing which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look oh</font>

515
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:02,010
no Cisco well both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them have</font>

516
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:05,759
something nice but let's look at a

517
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:07,980
prefix and in juniper you do it this way

518
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:17,640
and I've had to delete stuff to fit in

519
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:25,590
PowerPoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and you can see in this</font>

520
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:28,589
case I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two paths one of them valid</font>

521
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:31,250
one of them invalid because remember by

522
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:37,230
both being announced from Seattle and

523
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:40,020
Dallas so<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3130</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle and the role for</font>

524
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:43,140
this at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I took this picture was</font>

525
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:46,440
Seattle was the valid one and Dallas was

526
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:48,960
the invalid at the time I took this

527
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:54,630
picture let's see which is different

528
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:57,390
prefix um<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3130 was the valid one</font>

529
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:06,620
Seattle's the valid and Dallas was the

530
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:06,620
invalid different prefix same state

531
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:15,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cisco he's done something nice which is</font>

532
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:18,599
if you do the traditional show the BGP

533
00:39:15,989 --> 00:39:23,069
table for each prefix he shows you

534
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:29,880
what's valid and invalid<font color="#CCCCCC"> Juniper's hot</font>

535
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:31,200
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> trail you got yours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Congrats see</font>

536
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:40,859
if you play nicely with the other

537
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:50,129
children things work out so now if you

538
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:53,460
want you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and switch your road the</font>

539
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:56,519
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around and if you gave it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

540
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:59,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">3130 now give it to 4128 delete the</font>

541
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:01,499
other one or make rolls for both of them

542
00:39:59,789 --> 00:40:03,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you'll see them both as valid and</font>

543
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:08,009
that's what you would do in a situation

544
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:10,710
where you were preparing to switch and

545
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:13,190
you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what's called make before</font>

546
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">break</font>

547
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:33,180
we're just cruising right along here

548
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:43,120
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> really haven't got a whole lot</font>

549
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:45,010
more here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nice thing that hummus</font>

550
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,200
is added I said you know you wanted to

551
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:49,870
see all the invalid routes or all the

552
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:52,080
valid routes he's put in a command for

553
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,080
that

554
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:17,519
in your juniper routers

555
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:28,730
just sick let's grab you a mic there we

556
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:32,030
go this is a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shelly from dying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

557
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:34,580
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm cloud I was noticing the</font>

558
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:36,080
policy preference the policy options for

559
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:39,770
the Juniper example you've got local

560
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:43,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">preference set for validated prefixes</font>

561
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:46,550
their preferred more so there was set to

562
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:49,600
110 and the invalid ones who left<font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

563
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:53,480
fall so those are at<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 and then the</font>

564
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:55,460
unknown ones are actually devalued at 90

565
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,170
I'm trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> figure why the invalid</font>

566
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,650
ones were apparently preferred to the

567
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:02,420
unknowns you know is wherever i cut and

568
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:04,820
pasted that from did it and it's wrong

569
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,560
we're not wrong but certainly not the

570
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:10,430
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would advise you to configure your</font>

571
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,620
policy just making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess um would</font>

572
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:15,200

576
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:37,660
thanks for catching the<font color="#CCCCCC"> subject line is</font>

577
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:37,660
juniper policy screwed and I'll

578
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,509
screaming or do you give just enough

579
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:47,029

580
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:49,730
Eric Malloy point Randy is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a bug or a</font>

581
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:52,130
feature that Cisco doesn't reprocess the

582
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:57,280
route map when the validity changes

583
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:57,280
superb<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

584
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:15,940
that codes two or<font color="#CCCCCC"> three weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old hey</font>

585
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:17,800
that juniper is in the state I think

586
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,660
it's fair<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say this that there's at</font>

587
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:21,670
least three test engineers banging on

588
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,868
this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now this release is about</font>

589
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:27,910
three weeks old<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the next couple weeks</font>

590
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:30,000
we'll have something new fresh and

591
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:30,000
exciting

592
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:48,760
and I've about run out by the way so

593
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:51,359
questions experiments catch the bugs

594
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,359
please

595
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">top from dying again on the router</font>

596
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,830
protocol any reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why that was chosen</font>

597
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:09,529
to be left unencrypted is that by design

598
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:17,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh you're very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rapture that's a lot of</font>

599
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:24,580
stop stop deep pool okay Russ laughs

600
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:26,810
thank you don't let's go grab the foil

601
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:30,890
this is a really good question by the

602
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:35,110
way I'm just trying to find the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

603
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:35,109
foil oops I didn't mean that

604
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:53,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well tom is asking is why the heck</font>

605
00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:56,030
isn't this encrypted<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the reason</font>

606
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,030
it's not encrypted when he asked the

607
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:05,690
question why isn't it authenticated yes

608
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:07,940
the man right the problem is of course I

609
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,490
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> reach out for the IP address of</font>

610
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:14,390
this and somebody can spoof me and give

611
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:17,509
me all sorts of bad day poop<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the</font>

612
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:21,098
fact is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> erased from this foil okay</font>

613
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:24,020
this is AB covered by object security

614
00:45:21,099 --> 00:45:27,440
whoever's running this<font color="#E5E5E5"> cache inserted I</font>

615
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:31,970
Anna's root certificate and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

616
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:36,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">valid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by crypto object security we</font>

617
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:39,680
didn't want this is getting boring this

618
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:43,160
is getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> boring we didn't run this to</font>

619
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:46,848
have to do the crypto but so this is

620
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,770
running pure exposed clear text now the

621
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:50,599
way he originally class the question is

622
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:52,339
why isn't it encrypted it's not

623
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:54,410
encrypted because this is these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

624
00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:57,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">public jada we don't care if anybody</font>

625
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:59,470
reads them but at the proper a question

626
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:02,390
which he then asked is why is it not

627
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:05,209
authenticated when I reached out here

628
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:10,160
how do I know I didn't get a really

629
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:12,020
nasty gash server and in fact if you'll

630
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:15,470
read the current state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the RPK I</font>

633
00:46:18,829 --> 00:46:24,770

639
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:46,420
the poor bgp coder goes to hack this

640
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:50,598
stuff in there's no ssh left for her

641
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:52,910
she's stuck so does she go get the

642

approval from the people five miles<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

ever in the next building or some

645
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,140
horrible thing in these giant

649
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:17,300

650
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:20,610
implemented on any servers none and the

00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:26,450
motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a server stack coder to</font>

652

<font color="#E5E5E5">implement a 0 is very very small right</font>

653

md5 well the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> purists in the ITF</font>

654
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:39,600
think md5 is you know crap<font color="#E5E5E5"> eat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

655
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:44,520
that's Russ being polite mixed company

656
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:48,480
um but but it makes no difference

657
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:51,060
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> md5 implementations in servers</font>

658
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,070
are not good and complete and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

659
00:47:51,060 --> 00:48:01,400
motivation from that fixing that's about

660
00:47:53,070 --> 00:48:06,240
the same as al so SSH ayo md5 pls<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

661
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so we have currently we're</font>

662
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:15,479
converging on a position which says

663
00:48:11,210 --> 00:48:17,160
clear text is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for now well in the</font>

664
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:19,410
ITF we want to have one thing that's

665
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,140
mandatory to implement so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know I have</font>

666
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">a proper building so it will cook</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

667
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:28,200
what we're converging on today is clear

668
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:31,620
text is currently mandatory to implement

669
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:36,540
and we strongly advise you to have the

670
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:45,720
cache server very near your router<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

671
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:49,890
and md5<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH TLS and Dale are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

672
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:54,089
welcome to implement them and be warned

673
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:57,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in three years or so AO is what's</font>

674
00:48:54,090 --> 00:49:01,200
going to be mandatory to implement and

675
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:05,819
clear text will essentially be you

676
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:08,740
really don't want to do that if you have

677
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,410
a better suggestion you know

678
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:13,209
given the actual state of running code

679
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,879
and what's available we want to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

680
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:17,619
crap<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you</font>

681
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:19,869
know we know the purest is right and all

682
00:49:17,619 --> 00:49:23,290
that stuff but I can't run if you have

683
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:26,290
better suggestions for a strategy but

684
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:29,170
this is active discussion just one

685
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:30,970
addition to the list ipsec has also been

686
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:32,470
on the list under discussion it also has

687
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,720
problems particularly dealing with

688
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:36,600
routers routers can transit ipsec but

689
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,890
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so good at terminating it</font>

690
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,240
yeah they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the control point</font>

691
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:44,618
not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that it's a real</font>

00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,390
pain in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ass to set up but the key</font>

693
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:55,390
thing is the authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

694
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:57,700
know who I'm talking to everybody happy

00:49:55,390 --> 00:50:00,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">with playing with the routers anybody</font>

696

propagating and the little hamsters

699
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:08,400
running around on their wheels and

700

<font color="#CCCCCC">are very familiar with this stuff um</font>

703
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:33,640
some but those people are familiar with

704
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:37,400
it and mucking with routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> are me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ed</font>

this group's up to speed that groups up

708
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:47,090
to speed back there so feel comfortable

709
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:48,770
to grab people and play the stuff well

710
