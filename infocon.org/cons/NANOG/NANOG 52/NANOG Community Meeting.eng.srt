that went on this time around that I

thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might you know just kind of</font>

115
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,060
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have to discuss this here but I</font>

116
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:09,309
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of raise this this with</font>

117
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,220
all of you so if you see a board member

118
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,350
or somebody who's on the pc and you have

119
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,010
a feeling or a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of opinion on this</font>

120
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:21,370
let us know the first one is on somebody

121
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,050
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do to do a panel on but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

122
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,630
panelists couldn't be here and so what

123
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:26,920
they wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do was like remote using</font>

124
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,020
some kind of technology i don't know

125
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,160
what it was any of the ones available

126
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:35,020
and that ran into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of discussion</font>

127
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,290
both with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community members that we</font>

128
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:42,039
spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and on the pc itself so the</font>

129
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:44,169
point here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a if you have</font>

130
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,790
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion on this like if you think</font>

131
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:48,430
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> panelist should you know figure</font>

132
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:50,080
out how to get to nanog then let us<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

133
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you think it'd be okay not to</font>

134
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,740
have them here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and maybe we could do it</font>

135
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,450
through some other AV mechanism let us

136
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,430
know the other one that came up was this

137
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:03,159
has come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> times in the</font>

138
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,940
time I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been doing this and it came up</font>

139
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this time and and and the issue here is</font>

140
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,370
should should we work up we as a

141

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:24,669
we've had times when speakers have said

145
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:27,219
mostly retro actively please take my

146
00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:29,140
slides down but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying to be kind</font>

147
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,150
of a transparent organization and we

148
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,070
think that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> people give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk sir many</font>

149
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:36,159
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us do we think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if people give</font>

150
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,530
talks here it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> open and</font>

151
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,370
transparent and archived but we're

152
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,830
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in what you</font>

157
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:53,979
last thing I wanted to talk to you a

158
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,180
little bit about is if you're a

00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:59,860
first-time attendee please think about

160
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:02,470
attending the newcomers breakfast which

161

were to show up they'd get breakfast but

166
00:07:11,530 --> 00:07:14,979
they'd also be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

167
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,719
opportunity to interact with new people

168
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,120
at nanog mentor them about what it's

169
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,419
about and pass on some of their wisdom

170

214
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,810
charity organization and educational

215
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,819
charitable organization which means that

<font color="#E5E5E5">if you want to make donations their tax</font>

219
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,070

223
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:42,020
actually filed a tax return and we're

224
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:43,970
wheel speaking of being real the

225
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:47,540
trademark transfer from Merritt was

226
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,810
completed so nanog is us now we are

227
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,099
nanog that's it then i<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the</font>

228
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:56,000
community we own the domain we own the

229
00:09:54,100 --> 00:10:02,240
lovely logo that you see at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of</font>

230
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,130
the screen there that's all us the we've

231
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,380
put in some applications to get our own

232
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,790
address space from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin the approvals</font>

233
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,209
will been made you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they just want</font>

234
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:13,219
money so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure that part out</font>

235
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:14,599
in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of weeks but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

236
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">means that when we have our next meeting</font>

237
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:21,170
in October will have a network so that's

238
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">good and probably the biggest thing that</font>

239
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:26,990
we've done over the last few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months is</font>

240
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:29,660
we put out an RFP and reviewed some bids

241
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,150
did a lot of talking to vendors and have

242
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,839
selected AMS as our association

243
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:39,319
management vendor I'm not anybody from

244
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,120
AMS is out there but if you see them

245
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">give them a chance but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to</font>

246
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,649
be doing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the back office stuff</font>

247
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:48,950
for us for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next couple of years at</font>

248
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:50,180
least which means that us on the board

249
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:53,920
maybe don't need to spend as much time

250
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:56,810
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> sharp pencils and everything but</font>

251
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,360
but that's a big step<font color="#E5E5E5"> going forwards</font>

252
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,979
again it's a part of the

253
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,560
both of us ourselves as an organization

254
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,660
so we're thrilled some of you might know

255
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,510
AMS there they also provide similar

256
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:10,699
services for the IETF and some of their

257
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,839
organizations there then in our fields

258
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:15,950
and others so that's a big step for us I

259
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,940
mean your head we're not all done we

260
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:21,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to</font>

261
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:22,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on one of the things is trying to</font>

262
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:23,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do with this meeting</font>

263
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">going forward one of the things we'd</font>

264
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:27,619
like to hear from you after words and

265
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:29,630

269
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:40,279
more of a members meeting where we give

270
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:44,810

484
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to present the Finance Committee report</font>

485
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:58,080
dan Goulding is actually the chair of

486
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,490
the committee so I'm hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he's</font>

487
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,070
comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all these slides and</font>

488
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:06,930
what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say the finance</font>

489
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:09,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">committee has a 12 like six members and</font>

490
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:12,630
the committee and it is a standing

491
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,360
committee as appointed or identified

492
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:17,250
under the bylaws I think it's important

493
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,610
again just with transparency because the

494
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:24,090
nanog budget is out<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">committee put the budget together we put</font>

497
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:31,110
the budget<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you see based on a lot</font>

498
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:33,000
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumptions based on previous reports</font>

499
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:36,540
that we had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so we put a budget</font>

500
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,160
together and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> were not dealing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

501
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,930
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of facts because we were a new</font>

502
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">organization we were dealing with</font>

503
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:46,200
historical data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to make that</font>

504
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:49,080
data mold into the way we wanted nanog

505
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,210
to operate going forward that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

506
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,480
we're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with reality the reality</font>

507
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:56,670
is that we had a tax return that we did

508
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,090
for 2010 so we have a much better

509
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,920
understanding of our revenue and expense

510
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:05,209
because we did a report and we had to

511
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:08,270
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that and we'll know more about</font>

512
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:11,250
how the budget needs to model

513
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:14,490
differently because of nano<font color="#CCCCCC"> of 52 nano</font>

514
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:17,310
52 is the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that nanog is</font>

515
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,350
completely responsible for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

516
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:22,110
expense and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course receives the</font>

517
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:24,899
revenue the nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to report and so</font>

518
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:27,959
we will identify this more in the vet

519
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:30,240
slide as she reports on the logistics<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

520
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:33,360
the meeting is that we're on track so

521
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,060
while the budget report that on the

522
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,760
website again was made and some

523
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:40,530
assumptions the thing about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is we</font>

524
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,270
understood those assumptions in there

525
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,820
pretty close to reality and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

526
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:48,270
track which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really good to</font>

527
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">know some of the concerns I think going</font>

528
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,020
forward that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Finance Committee is</font>

529
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,610
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to deal with and we're</font>

530
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,279
always watching these the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Finance</font>

531
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Committee is</font>

532
00:24:54,279 --> 00:25:00,009
important committee so that finance

533
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,749
issues in planning isn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> dealt with just</font>

534
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:03,879
by the board but there's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

535
00:25:01,749 --> 00:25:07,229
committee of the community that's

536
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:09,549
advising the board on budget matters

537
00:25:07,229 --> 00:25:13,479
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a goal to break even for</font>

538
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:15,429
events and we want to build a reserve so

539
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:17,559
as we deal with the budget and we do

540
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:20,229
planning those are paramount issues for

541
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:22,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">us the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other element in you'll hear</font>

542
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:24,509
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of this information in later</font>

543
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:27,039
slides is we need to plan for<font color="#E5E5E5"> change</font>

544
00:25:24,509 --> 00:25:29,859
right the reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community</font>

545
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:33,339
wants to own a dog is because all of you

546
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:35,830
in your current employment fields have

547
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:38,379
changed and you have to have a budgeting

548
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:40,539
process that anticipate that change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

549
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:42,519
so one of the things going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward that</font>

550
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:45,749
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Finance Committee will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing is</font>

551
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:57,369
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that planning for change oh</font>

552
00:25:45,749 --> 00:25:59,950
and I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're to sobe okay so we</font>

553
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:02,049
stood before you a year<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and we</font>

554
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:03,820
presented our first budget so we thought

555
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,009
you'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious to know what have we</font>

556
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:08,559
done in a year and how are we tracking

557
00:26:06,009 --> 00:26:11,289
against this budget so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

558
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,029
events we have been dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

559
00:26:11,289 --> 00:26:15,279
professional meeting planner who

560
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:18,159
negotiates the hotel contracts for us

561
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:22,899
and this comes at no expense to us at

562
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:26,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">all hotels give a commission to meeting</font>

563
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:30,339
planners and that's so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel pays</font>

564
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:34,529
basically our<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy to negotiate the space</font>

565
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:37,479
for us we have been doing a new

566
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:40,179
memorandum of understanding for hosting

567
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:42,429
so we have a new hosting model that has

568
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:48,190
been in that is in place starting at

569
00:26:42,429 --> 00:26:50,710
nanog 54 so in our next fiscal year so

570

577
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:15,760
but will and we have a choice of two

583
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:43,178
meetings so where are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we so we present</font>

584
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:45,190
it to you for nanog 52 last year we

585
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:50,620
presented you a budget for the fiscal

586
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:52,660
year of 2011 and we said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for 52 53</font>

587
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:56,139
what does it look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're pretty much</font>

588
00:27:52,660 --> 00:28:01,660
on target really really happy to say

589
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:04,630
that so will will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be contributing to the</font>

590
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:14,140
reserve in 52 and also contributing to

591
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:16,870
the reserve in 53 meeting planning we

592
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:19,990
were talking as a as a board and as with

593
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,360
Dave and<font color="#E5E5E5"> PC and there's a few things</font>

594
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,700
that we wanted to discuss about how do

595
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,559
we plan events like this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more</font>

596
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:28,179
transparent and let you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are</font>

597
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,160
the constraints that we have to work

598
00:28:28,179 --> 00:28:34,860
around and perhaps you have good ideas

599
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:38,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">and suggestions so first off is beyond</font>

600
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:40,629
2012 as a community and as<font color="#CCCCCC"> members we</font>

601
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:43,270
need to think do we still<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

602
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,510
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have three meetings per year</font>

603
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:49,030
or should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we switch to a to meeting per</font>

604
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:51,100
year that's up for discussion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

605
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:55,059
would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your views on</font>

606
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,860
this perhaps after<font color="#E5E5E5"> and on the open mic</font>

607
00:28:55,059 --> 00:29:02,740
session if you want to comment on this

608
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:06,010
please do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be very</font>

609
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:07,780
useful like I've been the de facto

610
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:11,950
meeting planner for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> plastic in the</font>

611
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:15,370
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> year is we need as an organization</font>

612
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:18,570
a way to take your pulse as members so

613
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:21,909
help us plan the logistics

614
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:23,560
we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to contact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you we</font>

615
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,630
did not<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the mailing list</font>

616
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,290
because we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this was off</font>

617
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:33,340
topic so what should we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use as a medium</font>

618
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:35,770
how can we ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will you attend to</font>

619
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:38,770
this to this place do you need a room

620
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:41,379
this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we these are useful data</font>

621
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:45,160
for us to negotiate the contracts with

622
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:48,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotels just so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know when</font>

623
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:51,370
you contract and when you make up an

624
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:55,210
event in a hotel like this because we

625
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:58,360
secure a room block so we guarantee a

626
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:01,710
thousand nights for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hotel they</font>

627
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:05,199
provide all this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> space for free</font>

628
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:08,110
so we guarantee room block and we also

629
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:11,380
guarantee that we will spend actually a

630
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:13,629
ton of money on food and beverage when

631
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,910
you walk into a hotel<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cannot walk</font>

632
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:19,690
with food you have to take their food

633
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:21,610
these rates are pre they're they're

634
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:24,810
posted<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're listed and they're quite</font>

635
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to negotiate so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can imagine</font>

636
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:30,639
nothing is really cheap in a hotel plus

637
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:33,159
we have service service charges and

638
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:38,950
taxes that add on so it adds up pretty

639
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:41,110
quickly I want it also to let you know

640
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:46,450
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these hotel contracts are</font>

641
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:48,490
contracted 12 to 16<font color="#E5E5E5"> months out so you've</font>

642
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:53,260
seen the other slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're contracted</font>

643
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:55,900
until 56 we're closing<font color="#E5E5E5"> 57 so we need to</font>

644
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:59,110
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a forward view two years ahead and</font>

645
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:02,110
say how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> rooms will we need so we</font>

646
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:04,600
need to make a good guess so it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

647
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:07,510
very helpful to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your pulse on this</font>

648
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,389
and say if we make a meeting over in

649
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:12,670
this city will you<font color="#E5E5E5"> attend or what's the</font>

650
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:15,880
likelihood of you attending and then we

651
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:19,690
can gauge a proper room block room

652
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:26,140
blocks who here was not able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to secure a</font>

653
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:29,140
room in this hotel sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font>

654
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:33,760
there's another event on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 14 which</font>

655
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:35,830
takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of room we had we fully</font>

656
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,680
use our block like we're over<font color="#CCCCCC"> our block</font>

657
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:42,189
we actually got more rooms than we

658
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,410
contracted so we've been fortunate but

659
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:46,960
we understand that this was not enough

660
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:50,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">for some of you you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to find a room</font>

661
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,450
in a different hotel so again helping us

662
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,930
to plan the meetings and having more

663
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:57,850
data points on how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many of you will come</font>

664
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,580
how large should we secure the block

665
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:04,919
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful and then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get the</font>

666
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:08,470
best deal for you food and beverage I

667
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:11,320
put the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer but anyway we have</font>

668
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:14,260
generous sponsors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> D contribute</font>

669
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:17,889
roughly two hundred dollars per attendee

670
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:22,540
to give you three<font color="#E5E5E5"> breakfasts all your</font>

671
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:26,320
brakes coffee all day beer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and gear beer</font>

672
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:29,290
& gear and cocktail and everything it

673
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:32,260
adds up if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of the value of</font>

674
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:34,480
coming to an anode meeting when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you file</font>

675
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:37,330
your expense reports all you have to do

676
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,190
is your your plane ticket your three or

677
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:45,580
four nights and I want the registration

678
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:48,280
and probably very minimal on the food

679
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:52,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">because a lot of it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> provided by</font>

680
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:56,350
generous sponsors so thank them use it

681
00:32:52,300 --> 00:33:00,159
we have we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say before that</font>

682
00:32:56,350 --> 00:33:02,110
there was waste so this this time around

683
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:04,660
we're trying a new model we were a

684
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">little more conservative on the</font>

685
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:10,420
quantities so let us know if we made a

686
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,820
mistake we<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce different things we</font>

687
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,250
said we'll get refreshments all true

688
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:18,010
today we had comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you wanted</font>

689
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:20,860
water<font color="#E5E5E5"> coffee all true today we have it</font>

690
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:23,590
there we've also made a green choice you

691
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">won't see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too many cans you won't see</font>

692
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:29,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">too many single servings these cost an</font>

693
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:33,340
arm and a leg they're like six seven

694
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:38,380
dollars<font color="#E5E5E5"> a piece just to be on the table</font>

695
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:39,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jugs you can you can</font>

696
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:41,960
serve so we're thinking we're

697
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:43,789
doing something green it's also helping

698
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,980
the cost let us know what you think

699
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:49,580
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole lot of different</font>

700
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:53,000
things hopefully we won't lack food if

701
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:55,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do let us know let us know what you</font>

702
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,070
like to eat exactly what options you

703

logistical interface with both their

administrative staff and their technical

726
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:14,180
staff with support from Mike Smith I'm

727
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,569
really really excited our goal by the

728
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:21,319
end of june which is not far away to

729
00:35:17,569 --> 00:35:24,680
have all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the website current nana org</font>

730
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:26,779
in its entirety all of the history all

731
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:29,299
of the information all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the links</font>

732
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:33,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">working so everything just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you have</font>

733
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:35,960
today works on a machine at AMS and we

734
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:37,759
are in the process of transitioning the

735
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:41,089
mail list the<font color="#CCCCCC"> websites</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already moved</font>

736
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,829
we're testing all of the links now there

737
00:35:41,089 --> 00:35:44,420
are some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that aren't working</font>

738
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:47,839
because some of the links are hard-coded

739
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:50,270
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that rests on machines</font>

740
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,910
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ann Arbor and so until we make our</font>

741
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,230
own registration system

742
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,450
for instance and some of the other

743
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:57,940
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of those links just aren't</font>

744
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:02,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to work until we start populating</font>

745
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:04,599
in our 53 but it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

746
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:07,359
rewarding<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that a lot of hard</font>

747
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:09,430
work by the amf staff and certainly by

748
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:11,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">Mike Smith and some of the members of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the board we did make the transition</font>

750
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:19,390
things are working<font color="#CCCCCC"> ms is providing us</font>

751
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:22,538
hot backups as well as servers in two

752
00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:25,058
redundant data center locations so we

753
00:36:22,539 --> 00:36:26,920
shouldn't have in the future any kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

754
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:28,960
down time because of machine failure

755
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,010
we've really got a good base with them

756
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,539
we're currently reviewing the mail list

757

issues right now mailman<font color="#E5E5E5"> on servers in</font>

760
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:49,808
be moving into a new tool set called

761
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:52,599
arrow at AMS on their machines so I I

762
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:56,650
can't report that we're done but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

763
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:59,260
worried that it won't be done steve has

764
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:01,059
asked for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of extra</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

766

<font color="#E5E5E5">arbor running should we need them i will</font>

00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:19,390
any changes or any hiccups along the way

771
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:22,839
our goal is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> june excuse me I did it</font>

772
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:26,288
again July twelfth when we open

773
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:29,828
registration will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> operating totally</font>

774
00:37:26,289 --> 00:37:31,869
in the new environment what this means

775
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:34,089
to all of you is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the new</font>

776
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:39,059
registration process that you'll see for

777
00:37:34,089 --> 00:37:42,069
nanog 53 is going to look different<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

778
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:44,589
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the historical data that we use</font>

779
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:46,660
right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> for registration will not be</font>

780
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:49,630
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> over we have to build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

781
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:52,210
database fresh and so you will probably

782
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:55,089
have to create new credentials for near

783
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:57,490
now 53 and enter in some new information

784
00:37:55,089 --> 00:38:00,970
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> yourself for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> registration</font>

785
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:04,819
process that will be the last time the

786
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:07,100
new tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will be using arrow at amf</font>

787
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,320
is very dynamic<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll be able to</font>

788
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:12,529
make a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reports and a lot more</font>

functionality for you as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> member of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a different kind of member but</font>

792
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:21,009
we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about the transition</font>

793
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:27,440
one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we didn't do in</font>

794
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:31,100
our bidding process from the RFP in<font color="#E5E5E5"> July</font>

795
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,760
or februari is settle on a technical

meeting support vendor the board and a

number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the technical folks in the</font>

00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:42,110
chairs group have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been having a lot of</font>

799
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:45,470
discussion about what are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

800
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:48,890
webcast requirements it's easy for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to</font>

801
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:51,290
describe the networking requirements you

802
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:53,240
know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how you do this router in</font>

803
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:56,570
these switches and this is how we

804
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,490
connect to the commodity internet for

805
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,140
routing fabric I mean those<font color="#CCCCCC"> things are</font>

806
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,850
all pretty straightforward and vendors

807
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:05,750
can quote on that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gear to</font>

808
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:07,580
provide support what caused us concern

809
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,610
when we looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the cost of the</font>

810
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:13,400
proposals was the web cast the<font color="#CCCCCC"> net cast</font>

811
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:15,890
whatever label we want to put on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

812
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for folks who are not here in</font>

00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this venue with us to be able to</font>

814
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:23,330
participate or watch the meeting

815
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:26,390
remotely and it was either in our way of

816
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:29,799
describing that need to the vendors or

817
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:33,500
the vendors understanding our need and

818
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:36,380
submitting a proposal to us that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

819
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,480
felt we could endorse so given the

820
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:42,470
confusion in the need to move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

821
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,540
simply did not decide the goal is to in

822
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">their representatives from the vendors</font>

823
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:49,759
have been here talking with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us and as a</font>

824
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,860
board we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot of ideas about how</font>

825
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,830
to solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem but we haven't</font>

826
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:58,160
solved it yet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be by the end of</font>

827
00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:00,319
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> month making a decision before us</font>

828
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,200
and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's important for all</font>

829
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:06,560
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to provide input to the board</font>

830
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,299
about this idea that I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard about</font>

831
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,850
it again a reminder before I came here

832
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the lectern was well you know buddy</font>

833
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:19,900
let's just

834
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:22,900
sponsors to give you some gear let's

835
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:24,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">just get various hardware vendors to</font>

836
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:26,710
give you some gear and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then we'll just</font>

837
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:33,960
get volunteers to operate the network

838
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:36,609
support and I don't know about that one

839
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,800
one side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> me says well yeah you know</font>

840
00:40:36,609 --> 00:40:40,270
having been around the community for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

841
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,010
long time that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way we used to do</font>

842
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:47,619
it we used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have vendors provide year</font>

843
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:51,340
some provided it<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term some provided</font>

844
00:40:47,619 --> 00:40:53,350
it just for a meeting and then we had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

845
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,670
have whoever was in charge of the

846
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:57,279
meeting in this case it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the</font>

847
00:40:54,670 --> 00:41:00,040
executive director to go out and herd

848
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,350
the cats the volunteers to make sure

849
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,600
that they were on hand to<font color="#CCCCCC"> support the</font>

construction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> operation of the</font>

851
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,549
network during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

852
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:13,540
consistent for all of you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here</font>

853
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:16,030
to tell you that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not easy so I worry</font>

854
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:19,060
in that model about using volunteers of

855
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:21,160
the consistency the fact for the

856
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,410
membership as a whole to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come</font>

857
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,930
to the meeting and expect quality

service that the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of the</font>

00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:29,680
other issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've come to enjoy</font>

860
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:32,020
just aren't issues because it's all

861
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,990
taken care of and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why my vote</font>

862
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,930
thus far has been to deal with paid

863
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:40,540
contractors but<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we haven't made</font>

864
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:42,310
a decision it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good to hear your</font>

865
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,890
input on that view you've all been

866
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:47,490
around as long as I have and and maybe

867
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:50,680
longer so I'm sure you have an opinion

868
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:52,629
before I leave because this is my next

attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the the term limits that</font>

899
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:18,630
it's important to keep what the

900
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:22,740
community wanted in spirit even if it's

901

not directly in the bylaws a second

902
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:26,160
bullet point I kind of already covered

five dollars off each entrance fee and

908
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:36,630
then you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to vote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and voting is good</font>

grew up in<font color="#CCCCCC"> America there are some</font>

911
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:43,380
proposed bylaw changes they'll be talked

912
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:45,480
about by other people and let's see the

913
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,460
timeline we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an exact timeline</font>

914
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:49,110
yet we do know when the election is

00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be held but we don't actually</font>

916
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:52,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a time for when the nominations and</font>

917
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:55,320
petitions will be open we should have

918
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:57,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">that timeline in July right yes we will</font>

919
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:59,310
announce in July when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the timeline is be</font>

920
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:01,169
clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what does not mean</font>

921
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:03,120
nominations open in july that means we

922
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,610
will tell you<font color="#CCCCCC"> when nominations will open</font>

923
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,020
sometime in july then we'll go through

924
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:08,340
the standard ballot you can vote

925
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:09,810
electronically you don't have to be at

926
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:11,700
the meeting and then we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

927
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:15,630
election and the board results and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

928
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,819
shortly<font color="#E5E5E5"> thereafter usually the Sun the</font>

929
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,200
Wednesday morning of the nanog or

930
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:21,420
thursday morning of the nanog after

931
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,180
sorry the Thursday morning after the

932
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,900
nanog the newly elected board gathers

933
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,330
together

934
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,460
then selects the committee members so

935
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:33,180
that is the timeline of when things are

936
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:34,950
done so anybody have any questions good

937
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:37,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">or who here is not a member raise your</font>

938
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:38,790
hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you're sitting next</font>

939
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who isn't a member hit them and</font>

940
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:43,350
then keep hitting them until they go out

941
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:59,390
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> become raise</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your hand again</font>

942
00:44:43,350 --> 00:45:01,890
Oh next<font color="#E5E5E5"> pose bylaws how to make sausage</font>

943
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:03,629
so in the past the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we did it</font>

944
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,790
was ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> Merritt was responsible</font>

945
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:06,930
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that meant they had</font>

946
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,980
authority but they also had all the

947
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,430
responsibility for making<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

948
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,490
everything came off really well steering

949
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,230
collect steering committee was elected

950
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:18,240
and then they selected the program

951
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:22,140
committee<font color="#CCCCCC"> communications committee and</font>

952
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:27,000
development committee from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pool of</font>

953
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:29,250
people that volunteered then<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the</font>

954
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,070
transition we got this which I won't go

955
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:34,080
through point by point but suffice it to

956
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:35,490
say got very complicated because we're

957
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,900
transitioning from where Merritt was

958
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:38,850
responsible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything we're now we</font>

959
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,170
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> responsible for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything and it</font>

960
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,490
takes a lot of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> people doing a</font>

961
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:44,640
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different kind of specialized</font>

962
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,720
tasks to build this new organization so

963
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,790
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is what are we going to do</font>

964
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,640
now that merits no longer going to be at

965
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:54,090
the top of the of the the chart here and

966
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:56,310
it's in fact it's us so what we're

967
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,810
proposing is the board<font color="#E5E5E5"> of directors</font>

968
00:45:56,310 --> 00:46:01,580
which was the steering committee which

969
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:05,460
is this group here executive director

970
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:07,080
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Betty and then instead</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

971
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,160
old committee the sum of the committee's

972
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,980
you'll see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same the program</font>

973
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,740
committee development committee are

974
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:15,750
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been</font>

975
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:16,950
forever the Finance Committee which we

976
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:17,850
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a little bit in the bylaws</font>

977
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:19,589
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> for building all the</font>

979
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,010
budgetary stuff and then the change

00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,689
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be the technical committee now in</font>

988
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">like subscriptions and all that that's</font>

989
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,570
not a role that<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to be moving</font>

990
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,430
forward very well just since the last

991
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:53,790
meeting we've only had to really step in

992
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:55,319
on two threads so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the question</font>

993
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,420
do we even need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> moderate the list</font>

994
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,740
anymore and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arrow system</font>

995
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:00,600
all of the technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that we had</font>

996
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:03,930
to do can now be accomplished as a

997
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:09,710
technical task not as a communications

998
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:12,480
task which then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of goes into this</font>

999
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:15,270
which some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the where the the</font>

1000
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,620
communications committee was before the

1001
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:19,920
development committee would take over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1002
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:22,950
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roles for actual content so</font>

1003
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,180
Facebook Twitter all of those places

1004
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:26,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">where they need to actually get the</font>

1005
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">message out about nanog the</font>

1006
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,970
communications committee would go away

1007
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:33,690
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the technical committee then becomes</font>

1008
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,980
responsible for working with AMS to make

1009
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:37,410
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of nuts and bolts and</font>

1010
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,670
all the really fun stuff gets done so

1011
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:42,750
that everybody gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> their mailing lists</font>

1012
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:44,130
on time and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the proposal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1013
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:45,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way it would be going for and the</font>

1014
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:46,800
reason I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sausage-making is</font>

1015
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:48,810
because as members we actually have to

1016
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,940
vote on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this say that this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way</font>

1017
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:52,710
that we want it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be and then as of sep</font>

1018
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,360
tember when the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> directors</font>

1019
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,380
selects they'll be selecting into a new

1020
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,300
committee structure not the old

1021
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,780
committee structure and that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1022
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,780

1026
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,058
year ago to think about what that

1027
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,130
community meeting was like and reflect

1028
00:48:20,059 --> 00:48:25,369
on what's changed since then and what

1029
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:27,170
we've accomplished last time there was a

1030
00:48:25,369 --> 00:48:29,750
lot of discussion at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mics a lot of</font>

1031
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:31,400
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking us if we were insane I</font>

1032
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,579

1033
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:36,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions in the last year with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1037
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:49,549
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were asked during the</font>

1038
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:54,680
presentations who are you my name is

1044
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,579
would love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the stepwise evolution</font>

1045
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:12,079
I just try things see what happens maybe

1046
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:13,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">things work out maybe they won't but I</font>

1047
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:16,579
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're trying new things the</font>

1048
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:19,730
funding it looks good my hat's off to

1049
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:22,490
Chris Quezada my gosh all those sponsors

1050
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:24,410
ed that he came<font color="#E5E5E5"> through i'm just really</font>

1051
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,819
really impressed<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that and it sounds</font>

1052
00:49:24,410 --> 00:49:27,828
<font color="#CCCCCC">like things are going smoothly which</font>

1053
00:49:25,819 --> 00:49:29,690
brings me to the second point the

1054
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:33,200
question was asked about the form of

1055
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:35,660
this community meeting maybe we don't

1056
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,689
need so many of the details i mean it's

1057
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,399
it's almost an hour through and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys</font>

1058
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,260
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done almost all of the talking if</font>

1059
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,630
you really want the<font color="#E5E5E5"> community meaning to</font>

1060
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:47,869
be a discussion the suggestion would be

1061
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:50,240
put out the information maybe with some

1062
00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:52,609
narrative text and you know the

1063
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,299
spreadsheets and have that up on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

1064
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:59,359
and give us a week to digest it and

1065
00:49:56,299 --> 00:50:00,799
maybe then suggest to you some agenda

1066
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:03,348
items that we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear</font>

1067
00:50:00,799 --> 00:50:05,509
discussed and then the more of this

1068
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:07,369
could be community feedback and

1069
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:10,279
discussion for example one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1070
00:50:07,369 --> 00:50:12,440
questions was what what would you like

1071
00:50:10,279 --> 00:50:13,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to see in the community me anywhere what</font>

1072
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,090
would you like to see in the locations

1073
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:18,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">that might be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good topic to have it</font>

1074
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:20,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so we can kind of noodle on it and</font>

1075
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:23,259
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how we would discuss that in</font>

1076
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:25,690
this in this form and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the last one</font>

1077
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:27,910
had to do the locations you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> asking</font>

1078
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question you know two years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out are</font>

1079
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:33,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">we going to go to Memphis and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

1080
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:35,830
that's a really tough question to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

1081
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:39,490
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go back and you look</font>

1082
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:40,900
at all the attendees stats that we have

1083
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,729
for all the different locations

1084
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,200
throughout the 50 some net longs that

1085
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:46,120
we've done I think you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to find</font>

1086
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,609
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are three categories there are</font>

1087
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,259
those of us regulars who go to any<font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

1088
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">or wherever</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it happens to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's</font>

1089
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:55,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">the trunk you can just count on there</font>

1090
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:58,690
are those who are local<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll go to</font>

1091
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,370
those that are close by so that's where

1092
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:02,560
you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the San Francisco effect we were</font>

1093
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:04,450
always going to have 600 people showing

1094
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,310
up pizza San Francisco so you can count

1095
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:08,439
on that data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then there's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

1096
00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:10,480
a twenty or thirty or forty percent of

1097
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,310
newbies who have never been to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a net</font>

1098
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,630
aquaphor and if you add those up

1099
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:15,940
together thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up with some</font>

1100
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:18,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">pretty good ideas of what the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font>

1101
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:22,740
populations would look like the best

1102
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:25,750
thank you Bill um Jared who are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

things he remotest then boy they're

1105
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:34,150
actually pretty quick so uh<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean these</font>

1106
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,470
are sort of in response to a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1107
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:37,540
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that were asked the first to</font>

1108

our facility one as it relates to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1109
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:43,480
room block do you think that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1110
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know there's a delicate</font>

1111
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,050
balance involved there and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit</font>

1112
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right number do you think is we're</font>

1113
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:50,110
getting further out in some of the

1114
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,610
planning and stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1115
00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:54,340
be able to go more public with where the

1116
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:57,100
hotels are you know 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 months in</font>

1117
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:59,380
advance such that people can go ahead

1118
00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,180
and help you fulfill the room block

1119
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:03,070
commitments early with the reservations

1120
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:04,870
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think there's a lot of people</font>

1121
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:07,270
who wait instantly and then we'll go and

1122
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:08,830
block out those rooms even<font color="#CCCCCC"> when they</font>

1123
00:52:07,270 --> 00:52:12,160

1124
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:13,930
and this and the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just sort</font>

1125
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,029
of on the food<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that it would</font>

1126
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:19,029
probably be better to send out a broader

1127
00:52:16,030 --> 00:52:22,300
email message regarding some of the food

1128
00:52:19,030 --> 00:52:24,370
survey type stuff as opposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1129
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,840
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room because there is a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who aren't in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this room</font>

1131
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:31,020
and actually asking that the breakfast

1132
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:43,750
might be a great thing for tomorrow um

1133
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:46,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on it on the on how to get</font>

1134
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,760
the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to to the attendees</font>

1135
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:50,800
what would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the medium the mailing</font>

1136
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:56,260
list another mailing list that we call

1137
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:58,600
members at what's appropriate I think

1138
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:01,780
too I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just have to make</font>

1139
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">it part of the survey to be honest it's</font>

1140
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,050
probably going to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good way to get</font>

1141
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:06,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback on the food if you guys are</font>

1142
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,560
soliciting that I think the survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1143
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:10,180
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good place I know historically</font>

1144
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,400
speaking the response rates not been

1145
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:13,899
great but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say please complain</font>

1146
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,570
about the food<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure there will be</font>

1147
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:19,390
somebody who will i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to i mean</font>

1148
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:22,990
unfortunately you know it kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of works</font>

1149
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:24,879
that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had to two other things</font>

1150
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:29,290
either more just statements for remote

1151
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:31,420
participation as well as for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides</font>

1152
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:33,850
i think yes on remote participation and

1153
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,470
on the slides if you presented them<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1154
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:36,970
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really think you can really</font>

1155
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:40,720
retract them if somebody's going to get

1156
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:43,149
in trouble with their HR HR or press

1157
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,069
department that's kind of their fault

1158
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:47,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">for getting up and presenting without</font>

1159
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:51,940
clearance I mean it's not your job to

1160
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:54,250
babysit people out there job um Betty so

1161
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:57,280
it's jerk jerk just on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1162
00:53:54,250 --> 00:54:00,130
there's a when you submit a talk there's

1163
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,790
a you know click this thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it says</font>

1164
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:05,530
permission to record it uh-huh so you

1165
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:07,660
know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just should take that off</font>

1166
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:10,300
and just say put a disclaimer saying

1167
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:12,069
this will be recorded yeah I think

1168
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,750
that's absolutely fair I mean I

1169
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:16,030
submitted something for a lightning talk

1170
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:18,100
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's absolutely fair that</font>

1171
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:20,710
you know if I present something here

1172
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:23,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a yeah it's it's going to be</font>

1173
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:25,900
public ah you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though that this</font>

1174
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:28,480
isn't technically a public property<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1175
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:30,289
so I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that but by virtue of</font>

1176
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,699
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that that click box was there</font>

1177
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:33,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">at one time not everybody thought that</font>

1178
00:54:31,699 --> 00:54:35,539
right so that's why we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

1179
00:54:33,559 --> 00:54:36,949
understand it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i understand i think i</font>

1180
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:39,259
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're at the point in the process</font>

1181
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:40,729
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can say you are going to be</font>

1182
00:54:39,259 --> 00:54:43,160
webcast you are going to be archived

1183
00:54:40,729 --> 00:54:46,459
which leads into my next thing with for

1184
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,109
Betty I think one contractors I think

1185
00:54:46,459 --> 00:54:51,348
that's going to be the right way to go I

1186
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:53,538
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good use of the money to</font>

1187
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:55,279
be able to essentially enforce SLA s

1188
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:57,859
when people are volunteering you can't

1189
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:59,719
really enforce an SLA with the contract

1190
00:54:57,859 --> 00:55:01,640
you absolutely can with a contractor I

1191
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:02,959
think that's worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> out in the past</font>

1192
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,078
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> well with some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the people</font>

1193
00:55:02,959 --> 00:55:08,779
who've combination volunteered as well

1194
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:11,150
as done contract work historically when

1195
00:55:08,779 --> 00:55:12,380
I was part of the SC I recall<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

1196
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:14,269
had some really good experiences with

1197
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:17,749
some people I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a great way</font>

1198
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:20,328
to do that my other comment would be as

1199
00:55:17,749 --> 00:55:24,859
far as it relates<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the content and the</font>

1200
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:26,239
broadcast of it you can probably ask

1201
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:29,419
some of the people here who worked for

1202
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:31,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">cdns if they'd be willing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to engage in a</font>

00:55:29,419 --> 00:55:33,229
special<font color="#E5E5E5"> low cost contract for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you I</font>

1204
00:55:31,549 --> 00:55:36,259
really think that probably be the best

1205
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:40,698
way to sort of deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that and the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">last thing is for Mike we have to</font>

1207
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:48,259
moderate the mailing list I i wish i

1208
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:51,859
wish that every single person would be

1209
00:55:48,259 --> 00:55:53,479
adult enough to be able to do that but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1210
00:55:51,859 --> 00:55:56,538
don't believe that we're in a position

1211
00:55:53,479 --> 00:56:01,379
ever where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove any</font>

1212
00:55:56,539 --> 00:56:07,830
sort of moderation that's it make sure

1213
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:10,440
Michael Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sinatra yes net I have a</font>

1214
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:12,480
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick set of experiences about</font>

1215
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,430
the remote presentations I've actually

1216
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,890
given a remote presentation at internet

1217
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:18,720
to member meeting and I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually seen</font>

1218
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:21,569
lots of remote presentations of various

1219
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:24,689
internet to meetings um they can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1220
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:26,670
they're rarely really good and they can

1221
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:28,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quite bad at times if you're the</font>

1222
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:30,960
presenter it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to get feedback</font>

1223
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:33,779
from your audience normally you see who

1224
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,430
is sleeping<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is looking who's nodding</font>

1225
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,830
at you who is reaching for their barf

1226
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:41,129
bag and you can tune your presentation

1227
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:42,569
appropriately that's impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do or</font>

1228
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:45,270
it's very very hard to do you sometimes

1229
00:56:42,570 --> 00:56:46,680
get a screen with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1230
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:48,300
look like they're about<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight miles away</font>

1231
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:50,370
you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a good feedback</font>

1232
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">from your audience oftentimes what has</font>

1233
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:53,640
happened is the sound is bad or

1234
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:55,200
something's wrong usually if you're in

1235
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:57,629
the room you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can tell very quickly if</font>

1236
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,950
you're not in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room on the moderator</font>

1237
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,300
you might see<font color="#E5E5E5"> them jumping up and down</font>

1238
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:02,009
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> in front of the camera trying</font>

1239
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,600
to get your attention I've seen cases

1240
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:05,880
where the moderator has not been able to

1241
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,920
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the attention of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the person giving</font>

1242
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,320
the remote presentation because that

1243
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:14,790
person had muted the audience so it was

1244
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:17,430
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just went on and on and on so it</font>

1245
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">is possible to do them ok all other</font>

1246
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:22,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">things being equal I would certainly</font>

1247
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:26,460
lean toward local presentations live

1248
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:29,459
presentations yes strong preference all

1249
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:31,080
other things being equal but you know if

1250
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,120
it's a case of a really really really

1251
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:35,220
interesting remote presentation versus

1252
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:37,700
really really really boring local

1253
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:40,290
presentation then you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

1254
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:42,509
make an exception there and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1255
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:44,850
thing just try to standardize what

1256
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:47,370
people are using I no internet to uses

1257
00:57:44,850 --> 00:57:49,049
video but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes if you have someone</font>

1258
00:57:47,370 --> 00:57:50,779
doing a remote presentation with skype

1259
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:53,700
someone's using<font color="#CCCCCC"> videos someone's using</font>

1260
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:55,470
WebEx or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be a</font>

1261
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,180
complete mess technically to try to deal

1262
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:59,669
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so it one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that</font>

1263
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:02,250
maybe gets into the volunteers versus

1264
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:04,110
paid<font color="#E5E5E5"> people paid people may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a pay</font>

1265
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:05,670
contractors may have a solution that

1266
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:07,369
they have that's already sort of

1267
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:09,079
prepackaged they can send out clients

1268
00:58:07,369 --> 00:58:11,029
presenters and they can work with that

1269
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:14,589
so that might be one way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve the</font>

1270
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:16,670
problem thank you thank you Cathy I

1271
00:58:14,589 --> 00:58:18,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cathy Aronson I'm on the program</font>

1272
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,869
committee so I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for</font>

1273
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,650
everybody so what if there's this really

1274
00:58:20,869 --> 00:58:26,240
great presentation and it's by say

1275
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:27,950
government agency and the only way that

1276
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,129
they'll present it to this audience is

1277
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,598
if it's not recorded and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1278
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:35,240
something that everybody might want to

1279
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:37,339
hear do we turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down because they</font>

1280
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:42,229
don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be recorded or do we let</font>

1281
00:58:37,339 --> 00:58:43,578
them present I'm just asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

1282
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the program committee should have</font>

1283
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:46,730
the latitude to do as they please<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

1284
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:57,220
answering<font color="#E5E5E5"> because she said everybody in</font>

1285
00:58:46,730 --> 00:59:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the room are not count can't hear you</font>

1286
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:02,808
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay yes yes sorry is it jared montz</font>

1287
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,910
again I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they're willing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

1288
00:59:02,809 --> 00:59:08,599
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1289
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:10,220
be live webcast correct so we're going

1290
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:12,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">to turn off the webcast for remote</font>

1291
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:14,598
participants for this for the one

1292
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:18,579
session and black it out and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1293
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:18,579
has been blacked out by the government

1294
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:27,410
why I I think that if if they're willing

1295
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:28,940
to give the presentation they should be

1296
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to get the</font>

1297
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,359
appropriate clearances for it to be

1298
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,489
broadcast<font color="#CCCCCC"> this isn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really something</font>

1299
00:59:32,359 --> 00:59:37,130
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is more than likely</font>

1300
00:59:34,489 --> 00:59:38,930
something where I've done these types of

1301
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:40,700
things before where I've said here are

1302
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:42,169
some data<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm presenting and by the way</font>

1303
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:43,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm presenting it to the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

1304
00:59:42,170 --> 00:59:45,710
room<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I I can see the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1305
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:47,959
the room and I can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's not a</font>

1306
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:49,099
reporter in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but it may</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1307
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,599
something where I haven't gotten the

1308
00:59:49,099 --> 00:59:52,489
appropriate clearance to present that

1309
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:54,950
type of information and I think the

1310
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:56,660
challenge here is that if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1311
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:58,279
to go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and they need to</font>

1312
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:01,910
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right clearances to present it</font>

1313
00:59:58,279 --> 01:00:03,529
you know maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to take their</font>

1314
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:04,700
session in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next nanog because they</font>

1315
01:00:03,529 --> 01:00:07,239
have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through their press office</font>

1316
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,239
and take enough time

1317
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:11,670
no they're actually I think in this case

1318
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,780
they're pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much exactly the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

1319
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:18,180
thing because you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1320
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:19,950
present includes a live webcast the

1321
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:22,980
nanog meetings are what are currently

1322
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:26,569
webcast so you're proposing changing the

1323
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:31,010
meetings from being a live webcast to

1324
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:33,240
now we're going to black out a<font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font>

1325
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:40,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something I feel I can</font>

1326
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:43,649
support I personally think that you have

1327
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">two separate forms you have this public</font>

1328
01:00:43,650 --> 01:00:48,240
forum where people stand up and present

1329
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:50,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the group and that has been webcast</font>

1330
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,740
and then ought to be webcast and I don't

1331
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,810
like the idea of turning off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cameras</font>

1332
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,089
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time we do have another form</font>

1333
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:59,640
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these buffs where people can get</font>

1334
01:00:57,090 --> 01:01:01,170
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that isn't cast and that</font>

1335
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:03,060
might be an appropriate forum for

1336
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:08,550
something that requires this type of

1337
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:10,410
sensitivity<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> RS Rob's Easter mine</font>

1338
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:14,250
since I'm sitting up here should be

1339
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty obvious I'm on the board I have a</font>

1340
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:17,880
hard time to the point of the

1341
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:20,370
discussions about well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what if</font>

1342
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:22,110
hypothetically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government some money</font>

1343
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:23,098
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> some three-letter agency want to</font>

1344
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:27,180
come in this

1345
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:29,819
the other gnaw on it be webcast I have a

1346
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:32,549
hard time envisioning such a situation

1347
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:35,190
would would actually materialize and I

1348
01:01:32,549 --> 01:01:36,960
would hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we would push back on</font>

1349
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:38,339
that as hard as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we possibly could</font>

1350
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,079
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that anything that's</font>

1351
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:41,549
worth getting out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our members here is</font>

1352
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,680
what getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out to anyone who couldn't</font>

1353
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:46,410
attend Rob this has happened so that's

1354
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:51,239
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> there what has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad i was</font>

1355
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:53,848
checked out on that one look it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

1356
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:55,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened so we're not discussing a</font>

1357
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:56,519
hypothetical<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it's a perfectly</font>

1358
01:01:55,109 --> 01:01:58,769
reasonable question and we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

1359
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:59,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">some community feedback</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1360
01:01:58,769 --> 01:02:02,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the program committee should be</font>

1361
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:05,400
allowed to whatever they want that is

1362
01:02:02,609 --> 01:02:07,828
agreed<font color="#CCCCCC"> sonya sakovich on the program</font>

1363

committee that is happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> this session</font>

1364
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:15,479
and the FCC talk tomorrow is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

1365
01:02:12,180 --> 01:02:17,249
to be streamed or will not be recorded

1366
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:19,558
they've asked for that because they're

1367
01:02:17,249 --> 01:02:21,930
discussing their open it open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

1368
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:26,099
order and they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want anyone to</font>

1369
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:30,509
misunderstand or to have different takes

1370
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:33,569
on their content discussed outside the

1371
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:35,549
meetings so that is happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

1372
01:02:33,569 --> 01:02:37,710
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> agreed to support that as the</font>

01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:40,140
program community<font color="#CCCCCC"> at this time but the</font>

1374
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:41,849
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is has come up because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

1375
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:44,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know what we want people think about</font>

1376
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:44,539
doing that in the future

1377
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:59,620
justification Paco comes back this bill

1378
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:02,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Fenner I I've been involved in other</font>

1379
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:05,770
organizations where we try to you know

1380
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:08,500
the gut reaction to anything is to make

1381
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:13,420
a rule make an absolute roll instead of

1382
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:17,710
just giving the leadership the power and

1383
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:20,880
to make their own judgment calls and to

1384
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:25,230
select people with good judgment for

1385
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:28,390
these committees you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we</font>

1386
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:30,640
guidelines<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay guidelines are the you</font>

1387
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:33,460
know you push very strongly back against

1388
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:38,230
someone who says this you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1389
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:40,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">not to be archived or streamed but let</font>

1390
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:44,050
them make the judgment you know that's

1391
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,430
why we have these committees because we

1392
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:47,260
want them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the judgments about</font>

1393
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:49,000
what's a good talk we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to make</font>

1394
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:51,460
them the judgment about what's a good

1395
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,500
program if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the judgment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1396
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:55,930
this is a good program despite the

1397
01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:57,820
disadvantage that it won't be seen by

1398
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:00,279
remote members and it won't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be archived</font>

1399
01:03:57,820 --> 01:04:01,720
for the future let them make the

1400

speaking for myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to</font>

1415
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:42,370
observe that the FCC for this meeting is

1416
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:44,500
under the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> regime where they had</font>

1417
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:46,420
a tick box to choose so that's a

1418
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:49,420
non-issue and in a future where there is

1419
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:51,190
no tick box then I'm going to pain you

1420
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,270
know as much the pains me I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1421
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:56,480
Patrick we wish the

1422

the decisions and not mark or manage

them hey Charles<font color="#E5E5E5"> cooker one step I</font>

1425
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:06,980

1426
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,420
of the discussion on one hand you want

1427
01:05:06,980 --> 01:05:09,860
it to be free and everyone have access

1428
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:12,230

1429
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,850
people to actually present I believe

1430
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:17,660
we're asking the wrong question in

1431
01:05:13,850 --> 01:05:19,040
regards to presenting the data in the in

1432
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:20,629
the fact that if the presentation is

1433
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">being made to the members it should be</font>

that all that information is password

continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that we</font>

watch the stream live and get your data

I do understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's certain</font>

1508
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:27,980
streams that you don't get all the

1510
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:32,089
the live shows so that you can ask those

01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:35,540
questions if you're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in on a web</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get all that data so definitely</font>

1514
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:43,370
getting the the membership in the seats

1515

is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult the last comment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had</font>

1516
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:48,439
is another gentleman asked about getting

01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:51,108
room reservations in blocking out blocks

1518
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:52,519
of time and our experience about

1519
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:55,130
sixty-five percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of our</font>

01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">participants to our shows sign up within</font>

1521
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:59,660
three weeks of the show and<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

1522
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:01,189
booked their hotel rooms then in a lot

1523
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:04,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">of hotels they pretty much put off</font>

1524
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:06,349
either one month or two weeks in advance

1525
01:09:04,339 --> 01:09:09,920
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual show is whenever they do</font>

1526
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:11,720
not guarantee rooms anymore so it is

1527
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:12,120
extremely difficult to balance that

1528
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:15,360
number

1529
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,890
and getting the number lower than having

1530
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:18,389
too many rooms that aren't filled as a

1531
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:22,140
heck of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot better than the</font>

01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:23,640
alternative thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks one thing</font>

1533
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:27,810
I'll point out on the room block thing

1534
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:30,060
is that it is a guarantee if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we promise</font>

1535
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:31,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">to fill a certain number of rooms and we</font>

1536
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't feel that number of rooms then</font>

1537
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:35,370
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hook for it we have to pay</font>

1538
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:36,810

1545
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:53,610

1546
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,280
keep us away from our party but if you

1551
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:06,510
a full input from the community as well

1552
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:09,629

1554
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:13,940
we've been hearing for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1555
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:16,170
there is some group of people who prefer

1556
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:18,089
coming to two meetings a year rather

1557
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:19,470
than three or they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only come to two</font>

1558
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:24,960
or whatever so let us know what you

1559
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:26,220
think on that place and I last last call

1560
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,820
if there are any comments or<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

have two meetings a year doesn't anybody

1564
