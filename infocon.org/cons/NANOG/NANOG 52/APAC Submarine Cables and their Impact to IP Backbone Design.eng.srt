hi I'm rich<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trumka pacnet for years they</font>

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,870
don't know me basically here to talk

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,139
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsea cable systems in Asia and</font>

00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:18,480
schedules have on backbone design and

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,669
planning so first I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do a</font>

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,939
brief<font color="#CCCCCC"> review of subsea operations and</font>

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,789

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,800
and the second half of the presentation

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:30,960
I just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through the design</font>

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,580
factors that operating in region that's

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,440
heavily dependent on submarine cables

13
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,860
and what those factors are<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your</font>

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,809
consideration for designing backbones so

15
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,620
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all who is packed meant just</font>

from damage from having to high voltage

150
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,109
sent back to the test kit which is very

151
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:54,870
sensitive equipment and can determine

152
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:56,250
within approximately 30 meters where

153
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,380
that fiber fault occurred and this is

154
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:01,889
again over spans that can be several

00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,500
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sawtooth diagram that</font>

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,479
tell from the green line in the center

164

165
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,508

types there's natural disasters and

everything out in its path including

during the peak flood I took out two

443
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,839
there to extend<font color="#E5E5E5"> it another 70 kilometers</font>

444
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:08,450
but some of the limitations are based on

445
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:10,310
distance so typically coastal cities

446
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:13,160
like Singapore and Hong Kong are

447
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,950
appropriate for this model but other

448
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:17,390
countries in which there's long

449
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:20,090
distances between the cable landing

450
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,940
points and the city centres<font color="#E5E5E5"> such as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jay</font>

451
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:25,699
Korea and Japan this tends to create

452
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:28,730
issues in terms of whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not this</font>

453
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,050
is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> technically feasible so then</font>

454
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,180
the other approaches to go in the

455
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:34,490
opposite direction and in this instance

456
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,770
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically build data center in the</font>

457
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:39,110
cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> landing station and a classic</font>

458
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,700
issue is well cable landing stations are

459
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:42,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">typically closed environments so</font>

460
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,030
maintain carrier neutrality how do you

461
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:47,600
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to diverse systems and</font>

462
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,340
routes it is a problem but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

463
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting facts is that given the</font>

464
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,379
limitations on viable landing points if

465
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,180
you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> international cable systems</font>

466
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:58,730
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable landing points are clustered</font>

467
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,620
and so maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the same physical</font>

468
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,510
building but within a<font color="#E5E5E5"> few kilometers you</font>

469
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,459
have access to diverse systems and so

470
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:05,870
it's just organizing an approach to be

471
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,190
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access and interconnect to</font>

472
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:09,169
those systems to give the diversity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

473
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,450
you need and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may it's not a</font>

474
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:13,670
one-size-fits-all opportunity you may

475
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,990
look at a hybrid approach<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you keep</font>

476
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:16,910
your compute centers and your data

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,470

478
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,170
put a small network node in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cable</font>

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">landing station and in that case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

480
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:27,830
be more efficient in routing topology

481
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,750
class example is us to Japan so I you

482
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:31,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't today a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of capacity coming</font>

483
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,870
from us to Japan terminates into Tokyo

484
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">before heading on to other markets and</font>

485
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,520
so one of the efficiencies look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

486
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,470
put a small network node on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coastal</font>

487
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,060
edge in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cable annexation and you</font>

488
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,500
only route traffic into Tokyo for

489
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,879
traffic that has to drop him<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Tokyo</font>

490
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,950
the traffic going on to other markets

491
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:52,130
like Hong Kong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Singapore can route</font>

492
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:53,810
directly off of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ocean front so from</font>

493
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,080
a trunking standpoint we've seen the

494
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:59,330
migration of<font color="#CCCCCC"> fault-tolerance go from</font>

495
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,460
traditional optical protection where

496
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah optical protection was provided by</font>

497
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">the service provider the issues with</font>

498
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,660
this is lack<font color="#E5E5E5"> control on backup routes</font>

499
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,760
and the latency impact that you may have

500
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">on a backup path as well as ring</font>

501
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:14,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">interconnects so interconnects between</font>

502
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:15,080
systems tend to create a common point of

503
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:17,090
interconnecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the single point of</font>

504
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,570
failure so the shift has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

505
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:22,520
building<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network doing multiple</font>

control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the routes that you're</font>

performance of each route that you're

510
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:33,530
designing the issue becomes what if you

511
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:36,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into a catastrophic scenario where</font>

multiple systems are taken out again

513
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">Taiwan was a lesson learned in the sense</font>

514
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,190
that even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though you may have designed</font>

515
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,750
multiple linear paths over multiple

516
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:46,730
cable systems going through the same

517
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,650
pinch point may take out multiple trunks

518
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,410
and then now you're fighting and in a

519
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">scenario where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're choosing</font>

restoration as well as prioritization on

522
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,550
being restored with the supplier so that

523
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,780
one of the options is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

526
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:10,559
it's now taking taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a strong foothold</font>

527
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,120
in Asia this is basically setting up an

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,879
intelligent switching platform using a

529
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,239
sauna GM pls and in essence<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gives you</font>

530
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,380
a lot of control in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of the routes</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want for those backup pads and</font>

535
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,050
you can design in a way in which the

536
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,750
latency performance is within a delta

537
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:37,470
that's acceptable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you again this may</font>

538

not be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-size-fits-all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> approach you</font>

541
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">Singapore for example there are many</font>

542
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:46,650
systems in which latency performance

543
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,750
between those markets across separate

544
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:51,480
cable systems is within a few

545
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,520
milliseconds difference and so you may

546
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:55,770
look to actually build your trunks using

547
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,170
a provider supplied optical mesh for

548
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:01,530
protection for one or two<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your trunks</font>

549
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,420
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then for routes where the latency</font>

550
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,639
differential is significant you want

00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,530
more control<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can adhere to the</font>

553
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:13,050
the US where you may choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> a AG or TGN</font>

basically just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an overview of you know</font>

very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting I wanted to ask if you</font>

565
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:51,270
guys have looked at is a cop would it be

566
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:55,770
cost-effective to have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

lookout points on the shore to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see to</font>

568
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,060
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at areas where there might be ships</font>

current um it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it's I</font>

574
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,000
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of resources that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are involved in doing that again</font>

576
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,470
depending on how many cable landing

577
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,920
stations you have tracking that activity

578
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:25,800
can be very difficult additionally you

579
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,030
know again ships tend to take available

580
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,440
space where they can when they're

581
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,139
waiting for a particular port backlog

582
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,220
and so in that instance the locations in

583
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,070
which they actually drop the anchor

584
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,740
change and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> bury</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what may be</font>

sea water the ground that naturally

600
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:25,520
exists around the cable purely or do you

601
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:27,840
have exposure of the outer protective

00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,860
we use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as a reference point for the</font>
