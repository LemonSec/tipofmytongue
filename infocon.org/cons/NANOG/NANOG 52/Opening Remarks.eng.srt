time here in several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had been to</font>

88
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,240
several previous nanos in the past and

89
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">when I was packing my suitcase yesterday</font>

90
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,270
I had to go through the debate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

91
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,510
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dress code going to be the</font>

last<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I was here it was pretty much</font>

93
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,469
shorts and sandals and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I know</font>

94
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,149
is enough account upscale or not and

95
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,680
when I showed<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to the reception last</font>

96
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,030
night in a jacket<font color="#CCCCCC"> and saw that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was the</font>

98
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,390
the jeans today anyway because I'd a

99
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,950
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite out of place so it's good</font>

100
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:30,620
the fees that<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that some things never</font>

101
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,630
change so we have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved with</font>

102
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,780
nanog for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite a few years but this</font>

103
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:37,610
is our first time to sponsor the event

104
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:39,650
and we've been to some of the beers of

105
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,440
gears but this is something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

106
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,840
quite committed to as an organization

107
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,280
from alcatel-lucent and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

108
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,219
will be continuing to do as we go

109
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,190
forward these nano events are important

110
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,200
and for a lot of reasons and not least

111
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,910
of which is we're no longer just looking

112
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,260
at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology problems we</font>

113
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,170
have an awful<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of business problems</font>

114
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:02,240
to address now to which can arguably be

115
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:03,560
a little more difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve in the</font>

116
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical problems right now so I think</font>

117
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is important that we get together</font>

as a community as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> the various</font>

00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:07,220
make this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thing go so I don't</font>

144
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we can give them enough enough</font>

145
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,660
appreciation and gratitude for that

146
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,669
invents of interest while we already had

147
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:21,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the social last night so it's a bit</font>

148
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,730
redundant if anybody is expecting to go

149
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,490
back there tonight it probably won't be

150
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:27,410
quite as lively as it was last night but

151
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,410
we do have the Bering gear tonight from

152
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,440
six to eight o'clock encourage everybody

153
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,560
to go and participate and look at some

154
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:40,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the some of the particular pieces of</font>

155
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,750
equipment and the networking things that

156
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:46,730
we've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on there the nog lab</font>

157
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,500
with all of the various demos that we've

158
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,110
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> going and you use a bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a picture</font>

159
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of what we've got going a lot of ipv6</font>

160
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,790
this one would expect get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> WDM</font>

161
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,860
technology we've got some routing

162
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,070
technology to get some access technology

163
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:03,770
and I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's quite time to</font>

164
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,590
to pronounce the death of ipv4 but i

165
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,200
think the footsteps are coming quickly

166
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:11,630
so ipv6 is certainly front and center

167
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a lot of the implementations that we</font>

168
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,020
certainly look at now<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think it'll</font>

169
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">be an interesting time over the next few</font>

170
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,080
years

171
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,870
technical difficulties

172
00:07:25,969 --> 00:07:31,689
also nobody sees lives and I think

173
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go now we get a network</font>

174
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,120
diagram so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been talking to myself</font>

175
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,390
basically up here for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last few</font>

176
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">minutes anyway the rest of it was all</font>

177
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:50,210
words you can read them not a big deal

178
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:54,590
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is the network stuff</font>

179
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:57,409
is the fun stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can see we've</font>

180
00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:00,409
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fairly extensive v6 network set up</font>

181
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:03,020
with a lot of the v6 peripherals in

182
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,780
order to to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> demonstrate some of</font>

183
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,530
the end end v6 performance network

184
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:11,869
itself we've got the the nog lab that's

185
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,940
hooked up and wired through some of the

186
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,400
various other<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of the the hotel to</font>

187
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:18,170
provide connectivity going back through

188
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,489
the nanog router and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally up</font>

189
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,750
through CenturyLink so again thanks to

190
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:24,920
essentially for providing this

191
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:26,750
connectivity the obligatory network

192
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,700
diagram yep we got switches and routers

193
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,050
sitting around aggregating things up I

194
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,020
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

195
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,340
rocket science here but proof of merits

196
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,098
hard work got to have the obligatory

197
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,740
pictures of the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual wiring</font>

198
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:41,180
closets and all the all the real the

199
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,280
real work that goes on into putting

200
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,660
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> this on to get all this</font>

201
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:48,589
connectivity up and get all the labs

202
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:50,510
connected in wiring closet memories and

203
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,510
certainly we all have seen a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

204
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,400
punch down blocks in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the past so again</font>

205
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,410
thanks very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much for attending the show</font>

206
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm really looking forward to to seeing</font>

207
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,650
how how this is developed over the last

208
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:02,650
few years and welcome

209
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:15,480

<font color="#E5E5E5">that well let's do this first hi there</font>

215
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,680
I'm on the race team I am going to say a

216
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:41,180
few words about them but a dear friend

217

yeah sorry last week and when as we're

220
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:53,399
such a small and tight-knit community

221
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,189
quite a diverse community that Joe

222
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:00,720
really enjoyed being in part off I put a

223
00:09:56,190 --> 00:10:03,330
few words will be appropriate you know I

224
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,830
really love the fact that everyone that

225
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:09,149
knew Joe went when describing water and

226
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:13,589
that finds us some difficulty because

227
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:16,560
frankly<font color="#CCCCCC"> his he was a very unique guy and</font>

228
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:18,810

frequently mostly around has great smile

230
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:24,239

232
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,649
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it now this is hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

233
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,560
speak but yeah but also they were

234
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:35,370
referred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about him just being a</font>

left-field thinker and yeah and someone

241
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:02,480
who has a depth of knowledge in this

242
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,770
particular technical field that that was

243
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,870
astonishing to anyone who had the

244
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,290
pleasure of working with him depth of

245
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:12,240
his knowledge across an expertise across

246
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,510
optical mpls routing switching software

247
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,920
and favorite hobby of bug hunting

248
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:23,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was just breathtaking for her to</font>

249
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,900
experience it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a personal note I I</font>

250
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:29,620
was Joe was one of the very few people

251
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,150
that was a was a really inspiring mental

252
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,700
his ability to understand large-scale

253
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,189
complex systems and then explain them in

254
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:40,040
a few swipes were painted at a

255
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:44,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">whiteboard what was the just on</font>
