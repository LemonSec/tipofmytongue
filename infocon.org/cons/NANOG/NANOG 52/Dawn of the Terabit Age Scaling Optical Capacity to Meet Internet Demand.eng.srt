00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:10,110

<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet demand over next decade or more</font>

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:20,189
so an interesting article was<font color="#CCCCCC"> published</font>

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,320
in January by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Otto saleh and Jane</font>

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,430
he made<font color="#CCCCCC"> a sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of audacious claim that</font>

grow a thousand x over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next 20 years</font>

10
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,540
how did<font color="#E5E5E5"> he get there pretty simple</font>

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,540
actually just by taking a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40-percent</font>

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,360
compounded annual growth rate over 20

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,250
further and talked discussed he and she

15
00:00:43,339 --> 00:00:49,949
alone Jane put forth a proposal for<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

16
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:52,470
we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> might get there and some</font>

17
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:55,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting things fell out first of all</font>

18
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,930
that their first<font color="#E5E5E5"> factor of three was</font>

19
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:59,220
just using the capacity that's already

20
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,650
there in the network today an awful lot

21
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">of capacity is actually there in the</font>

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,519
transport network and<font color="#CCCCCC"> as unused because</font>

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,970
we're actually all the network that's

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,650
unused because of inefficiencies but the

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,810
biggest factor is simply by increasing

26
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,840
spectral efficiency on fibers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

27
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,420
optical transport network and moves go

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,090
back there's about a 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> X at least a 10</font>

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,130
X there and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's starting from</font>

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,950
a baseline<font color="#CCCCCC"> of today's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 gigabit per</font>

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:31,020
second wave for transport systems that

32
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,220
put about three terabytes of capacity

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,600
three or four terabytes of capacity on a

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,150
fiber so first we need to understand

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,130
what the transport layer is I think a

36
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,500
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of guys here or people here are</font>

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,210
focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the IP network where of</font>

38
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,440
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got service routers and</font>

39
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,720
peering routers and all your core

40
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,880
routers but there's an optical a whole

41
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,039
nother actually two whole other networks

42
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,830
that sit below that first in OT n

multiplexing of smaller circuits on to

48
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,068
the bigger wavelengths and then of

yeah when you those black lines between

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,390

<font color="#E5E5E5">the transport network as it goes across</font>

55
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,750
have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> been scaling the optical</font>

transport network in the last decade<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,280
a half is really through WDM and the

00:02:29,209 --> 00:02:33,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">network's been scaling simply by take by</font>

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,290
a scaling up the bit rate per wavelength

60
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:38,000
but second by scaling up the number of

61
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,560
wavelengths and we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone from two and</font>

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,680
half gigabits on a single wavelength to

63
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,780
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nap gigabits on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 4 8 16 wavelengths</font>

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,030
40 wavelengths then up to 10 gigabits

65
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:52,070
and it's scaled up to 160 wavelengths

66
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:54,260
and in some cases today at 10 gigs or 40

67
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:57,079
gigs at 80 wavelengths or 100

68
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,489
wavelengths how are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to continue</font>

69
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,320
from here we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to continue</font>

70
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:01,670

78
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,739
to go up so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting to compare</font>

distance and they they have in any

150
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,030
generation it has a rough constant that

151
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:19,159
you can get to for that level of

152
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:21,619
technology and and that that sort of

153
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,720
constant is now peeking out with the

going to give us more re more capacity

163
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:49,020
but because of the nonlinearities of

you're actually going to as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use</font>

170
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,710
those technology actually decreases the

<font color="#E5E5E5">unfortunate unfortunate you can't just</font>

keep pumping up<font color="#CCCCCC"> capacity without</font>

unfortunately taking hit on the reach so

175
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,440
the nice thing about phase modulation is

176
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,550
it's much more tolerant of fiber

177
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,900
impairments like chromatic dispersion

178
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:21,330
polarization mode dispersion

179
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:26,000
non-linearity etc and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

181
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,680
but as we increase the baud rate of it

182
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:34,039
of course the those impairments have

183

always scaled with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the square</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to get to terabit waves</font>

first question<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask is</font>

205
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,770
do we really want a terabit waiver what

206
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:31,370
is what we're looking for just a terabit

207
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,500
on a line card a terabit is a single

209
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,429
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is is reaching the</font>

210
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,289
conclusion that really that's what

211
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:42,329
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for and that 100k per</font>

212
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,530
wave or sorry turbit we're wave and

213
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:44,550
higher is actually not gonna be

214
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:48,420
practical as the

215
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:51,479
following charts like<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the show so how</font>

216
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:53,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the coherent detection done you</font>

217
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,899
basically take your<font color="#CCCCCC"> wavelength coming in</font>

218
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,518
and you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it through this optical</font>

219
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,709
mixer circuit that separates the

00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,649
polarizations separates the phase<font color="#CCCCCC"> state</font>

221
00:08:58,709 --> 00:09:02,790
separates the wavelength and and it

222
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,920
separates it into a number of different

223
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">signals and it takes as many as eight</font>

224
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:10,140
photo detectors for each wavelength to

225
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,410
get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that information and get it</font>

226
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,420
into the DSP through a bank of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dcs so</font>

227
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,829
in previous generation technology with

228
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,750
direct detection you only had a single

229
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:23,839
photo detector now it takes eight times

230
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:26,579
as many<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22 to decode a single wavelength</font>

231
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,170
so that requires well<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously a lot</font>

232
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:30,689
more optical circuitry which makes your

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,760
optical circuits very complicated it

different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the chart shows</font>

499
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:43,860
signals is a terabit signal and what

500
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,178
you're seeing actually is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the black</font>

501
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,908
portion is actually showing multiple

502
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:51,909
super channels imposed on the same fiber

503
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:54,429
or so it's it's many terabytes across

504
00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:56,590
that fiber but within the red box each

505
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:57,940
one it's a turbid signal and what we're

506
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,189
doing is changing the number of carriers

507
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,350
changing the modulation format of each

508
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,779
of those carriers to still get a terabit

509
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:06,129
but at different amounts of spectrum and

510
00:20:04,779 --> 00:20:08,230
then that different amount spectrum we

511
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:10,419
can put more or less of those super

512
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,240
channels on the same fiber so as a

513
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:16,210
result at a shorter reach for a qpsk we

514
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,890
get 12 terabytes on the fiber but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 16</font>

515
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,350
plomb if we want more capacity we can

516
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:24,880
get maybe 25<font color="#CCCCCC"> Turbots per second across</font>

517
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:26,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fiber</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so what's nice</font>

518
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,789
though is that we can take those

519
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,710
technologies and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the software</font>

520
00:20:27,789 --> 00:20:31,629

00:22:51,309 --> 00:22:55,600
also you summarized it but I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like one</font>

579
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,830
clarification in somewhere in towards

580
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">the end you mentioned that you can</font>

581
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:01,299
because of the programmability you can

582
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,009
use the super channel concept even<font color="#CCCCCC"> today</font>

583
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:04,720
and then of course as you move to

584
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:07,389
griddle aerodromes it becomes much

585
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier to implement so to what it so to</font>

586
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:12,158
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent can you actually do it today</font>

587
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,749
where you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU grid you know</font>

588
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,179
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of capacity increases can you</font>

589
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:17,499
get for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a super channel versus what</font>

590
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:18,730
would be possible when you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

591
00:23:17,499 --> 00:23:20,799
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a totally grid less</font>

592
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:23,860
environment yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I misspoke on</font>

593
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:26,168
one of the slides near at the end the

594
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,699
you with today's 50 gigahertz based

595
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:30,249
optical layer you can't use the super

596
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,129
channel concept because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> it each</font>

597
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:35,019
wavelength on a 50 gigahertz some people

598
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:37,360
like in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Venera actually combined two</font>

599
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:39,850
wavelengths into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 25 gigahertz each but</font>

600
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,649
can fit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> through 50 gigahertz but</font>

601
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:44,350
otherwise to get to the

602
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:46,240
through super channel the existing Road

603
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:48,280
ohms don't work because they've got that

604
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,480
hard separation at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 gigahertz okay</font>

605
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">great so that's what I was looking for</font>

606
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,480
so that means to go to the super

607
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,640
channels we eventually need a grid less

608
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,190
environment but we are untethered from

609
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:02,550
the ITU grid right that is untethered

610
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:08,530
from the IT grid yeah yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks</font>

611
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:11,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay anybody else all right drew thanks</font>

612
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,730
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much all right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you everybody</font>

613
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,060
you
