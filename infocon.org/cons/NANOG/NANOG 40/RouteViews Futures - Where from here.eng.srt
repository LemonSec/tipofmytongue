1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,859
so the question I'm kind of wanting to

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask you all as in these slides and it's</font>

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically do we really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:12,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">doing this this is a question and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here's</font>

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,639
how I see it basically i think it was 95

6
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,838
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ancient history anyway I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is building</font>

7
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,640
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and I couldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,020
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at what how other people</font>

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,390
saw my<font color="#E5E5E5"> routes so Randy was kind enough</font>

10
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,789
to dump Annie<font color="#E5E5E5"> ebgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop session on</font>

11
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,420
the 2500 or whatever I had in those days

12
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,250
from Mae Mae West but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> time went by</font>

13
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,750
we got more peers researchers one of the

14
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,630
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the thing we deployed more</font>

15
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,890
boxes in various locations and all of a

16
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,020
sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> around these was this public</font>

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:40,559
utility in<font color="#CCCCCC"> north there's five terabytes</font>

18
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,879
of data spinning in their routing data

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,209
going back to nineteen ninety seven

20
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,010
actually and there was lots of support

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,719
from all the communities<font color="#CCCCCC"> of interest all</font>

22
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,320
the operational community researchers

23
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,949
and ass a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> of oh on and on Joel Lucy</font>

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,649
ons all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those people um I don't want</font>

25
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:02,039
let's see however I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> things have</font>

26
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,539
really changed nowadays there's a lot of

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,850
this stuff out there lots of servers

28
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,560
various types you know it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

29
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,470
know I gotta<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell it somewhere and say</font>

30
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,040
show ibgp something somewhere lots of

31
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:17,310
that around refuse has two<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those and</font>

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,020
runs sort of a CLI on all the zebra

33
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">quadro boxes so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on all</font>

34
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,229
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> boxes too there's the riper is</font>

35
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,179
there's all kinds of looking glasses

36
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,429
there's all kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tools like will</font>

37
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,409
hear about bgp mon but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think most</font>

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,939
importantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that the substrate</font>

39
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:32,880
that we had for this thing at U of O is

40
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,070
kind of crumbled a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,189
know if we want so my question<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of</font>

42
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,619
everyone here is should<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really keep</font>

43
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,139
this going um we have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

44
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,880
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> of funding but so we're okay with</font>

45
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,369
that I think for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> short term anywhere</font>

46
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,270
but you know is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> value to people</font>

47
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:53,759
find value in it and thank thank you

48
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,229
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let me ask my next</font>

49
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,799
question are there enough other sources

50
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,899
of the data that's another one and so my

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,700
questions were really you know we we did

52
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,140
this for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if the answer</font>

53
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the previous question was now you</font>

54
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,610
guys just oughta shut it down well we I

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,318
guess that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be a fair thing but I</font>

56
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,580
would wonder about this historical data

57
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,530
because someday I think it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

58
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful to somebody that look back and</font>

59
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:15,690
say

60
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,280
your data is not perfect because in the

61
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,550
early days we were just collecting show

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,960
IP bgp screen scraping and people had

63
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:23,400
built tools up around that and then we

64
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,910
went to mrt and now we're going to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

65
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,650
xml and so that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> i thought was</font>

66
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,980
important you know and maybe someday

67
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,960
some of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want that but if so</font>

68
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,369
then we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we if we</font>

69
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,920
really want to keep this as a public

70
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:40,230
utility<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's sort of everybody's in</font>

71
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,730
some way I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about</font>

72
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:44,250
that a little bit and start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

73
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,320
about it now because it's fairly fragile

74
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,080
I have to say it's fairly fragile it's

75
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:53,280
very thinly staffed right and very

76
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,630
thinly supported and I don't know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> y</font>

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,030
of 0 is going to be the place we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

78
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,650
it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future so if we do want to do</font>

79
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and if you are interested in that</font>

80
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,270
I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I like well if you have</font>

81
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,590
opinions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this either way you know</font>

82
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,780
please come and tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it and</font>

83
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,510
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did want to kind of get a</font>

84
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,360
feeling for people about where and how

85
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,010
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> continue in the most public sort of</font>

86
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,540
utility way we can with this if we're

87
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,820
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so Jared hi Jared much NTT</font>

88
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,679
America so what do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to keep the</font>

89
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,450
service coin I believe it's absolutely

90
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,160
valuable to keep it up keep the

91
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:29,988
historical data available do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font>

92
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,799
disk do you need bandwidth do you need

93
00:03:29,989 --> 00:03:34,920
you know you need all of those things

94
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,330
but you just need humans to spend the

95
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,350
time with stuff do you need people

96
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,390
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need all of those things</font>

97
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,920
because you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that somebody asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

98
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,420
about this once and I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kick</font>

99
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,690
characterize running their out these

100
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,980
thing is it's sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you have a</font>

101
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,630
it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have all of the problems</font>

102
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,640
you have with your if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

103
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,560
know service provider but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

104
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,540
data plane it's all control plane right

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,980
so that's what it's kind of like you

106
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,570
know so you have the operational aspects

107
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,910
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but you also have to have some</font>

108
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:01,200
infrastructure you know to support it

109
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,609
like you're saying you need disk you

110
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,470
need to buy a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> discs you need to have</font>

111
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,030
you know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> to slap any disks</font>

112
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,370
there you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you need that you</font>

113
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">know you need the Rackspace know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

114
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,709
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff is is this something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

115
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:15,209
know money or collections or something

116
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,100
that would help solve some of these

117
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,079
problems I don't know if it's money I

118
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:21,419
think it's more like well I don't know

119
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,229
what if you mean cash money I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

120
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:26,969
it's that if you mean resource yeah you

121
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:28,859
know like the ones I just mentioned

122
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:33,330
okay we can talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it more offline</font>

123
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:35,310
Joel uh Julie<font color="#CCCCCC"> egli so I worked unravel</font>

124
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,950
use for a couple years I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

125
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:39,300
actually still working on it but Joseph

126
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,159
responsible for most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> good stuff</font>

127
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,960
that happens with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ralphie's in case you</font>

128
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,580
know that wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear yeah men many</font>

129
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,620
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are responsible for good things</font>

130
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,409
that happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the route is I'm actually</font>

131
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,030
really what I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was um you</font>

132
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,840
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> rap is is benefited tremendously</font>

133
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:58,369
from time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> energy and resources that</font>

134
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:03,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">have been provided by this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> community and</font>

135
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:08,580
I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I had a vision for the</font>

136
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:11,850
future of<font color="#E5E5E5"> reviews it would involve the</font>

137
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:15,450
community having even more investment in

138
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,340
it rather than than less and um I mean

139
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:21,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">because like I have a lot of emotional</font>

140
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:24,239
and investment in time that I put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">endure at views and I think um you know</font>

142
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:32,100
people who leverage the facility should

143
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:35,969
have that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I've</font>

144
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,120
benefited tremendously from it<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>

145
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,010
right Ravi's is a great trusted resource

146
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,780
have you considered partnering with an

147
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">exchange point operator like switching</font>

148
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,070
data or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix that they could Co Co</font>

149
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:50,099
locate it and they have staff that knows

150
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:52,229
how to run similar services<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's 24 by 7</font>

151
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,780
you know I've thought about that and

152
00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:58,620
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> even talked to a few people about</font>

153
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">it um but I'm actually I'm actually</font>

154
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,810
acting on it right here right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

155
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,250
so you know yes as a customer of the

156
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,229
exchange points i would pay additional

157
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,240
to have the service available because my

158
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:15,599
customers use it thanks that's good

159
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:16,830
information right loud UCLA I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

160
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,220
provide a slightly different perspective

<font color="#E5E5E5">to what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I started off as</font>

162
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,940
a PhD student in my first year and I

163
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,780
wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> finding a right problem to work</font>

164
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:30,560
on and then I found out he's so I'm not

165
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,669
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to imply out uses a problem but</font>

166
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,260
different perspective is that they

167
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,750
should definitely go on I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

168
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,580
reason being that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> PhD students</font>

169
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,050
out there are very close to getting

170
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,508
their PhD

171
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:45,870
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take this source off you're going</font>

172
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,819
to deprive them all the hard work so I

173
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:49,970
extend my full support throughout views

174
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:52,909
and thank you for everything you've done

175
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:56,250
got you that's a different perspective I

176
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:58,979
am Ricardo<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oliveira CLA also burn I</font>

179
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:06,210
fuse also and I like to say that so far

180
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,479
rod fuse is one of most reliable sources

181
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:12,090
for inferring ternet apology there are

182
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:15,419
other projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> around like Skeeter from</font>

183
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:17,909

184
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:20,849
inaccuracies on their data and so far

185
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:22,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgp data from routers in raipur the most</font>

we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep Rodney's go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks there</font>

189
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:33,750
Ricardo was alluding to was that there

190
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,190
there there is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

193
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:42,300
folks were after trying to get that by

194
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,229
using the data plane to find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and one</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things we have thought about</font>

self a little bit and trying to use some

00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:50,069
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques to fill in</font>

199
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:54,210
that data but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we never got around to</font>

200
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:56,099
doing it but anyway so if you have other

201
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,840
thoughts right or anything like that on

202
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,819
this please contact me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm interested in</font>

203
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're thinking do you know yeah</font>

204
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:06,330
you have to encapsulate before or after

205
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:07,590
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you should expand reviews</font>

206
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,568
and put it in more locations in the

207
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,789
internet and maybe have it run ibgp

208
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,990
among the different locations I think

209
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:16,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be good to get different views</font>

210
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:18,090
depending on topology rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

211
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,090
expanding is I'm for expanding it you're

<font color="#E5E5E5">mention that probably the biggest of the</font>

234
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,970
reviews was really locations and and

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,010
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to be the remote hands when</font>

236
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,810
that was really required so that's

237
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:24,560
probably the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> efficiency I would</font>

238
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:27,329
see in route views in terms of we need

239
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,000
more contribution in that in that area

240
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,910
the operation of course yes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

241
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,240
of help yeah the remote hands thing um

242
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely I my biggest concern um just</font>

243
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,650
in case it wasn't clear to people is

244
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:44,360
that the infrastructure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

245
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:46,490
that both you know the management and um

246
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,690
intellectual infrastructure that was

247
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,430
around you about that allowed this all

248
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,750
stuff to grow is it's not really there

249
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,079
anymore so it's a little bit difficult

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root views data is part of a global</font>

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:30,480
are not sure it's an it's nba's but if

<font color="#E5E5E5">understand study it so it's for my point</font>

00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:44,420
