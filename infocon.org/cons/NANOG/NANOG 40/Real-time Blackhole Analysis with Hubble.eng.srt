00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,240
hi I'm Ethan cats<font color="#E5E5E5"> bassett and this is</font>

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,750
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harsha who just spoke and</font>

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,400
others at the University of Washington

4
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:13,200
so while with I plane we've been

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,940
analyzing the data for over a year now

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,859
we're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> now beginning to mine that</font>

7
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,140
same data for reach ability and black

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:20,520
hole problems so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is much more work</font>

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:27,570
in progress than the talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> her show</font>

10
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:29,400
just gave the most basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP and</font>

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,260
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is to ensure global reach</font>

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,360
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if there's a</font>

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,850
physical path there should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a BGE path</font>

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,920
and if there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP path than traffic</font>

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,320
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be reaching but if you're like me</font>

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,570
and you regularly read the outages

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,250
mailing list and nanog mailing list you

18
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,690
know that that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always the case and</font>

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,809
sometimes it's hard<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell what's going</font>

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,218
on maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the postings are Randy</font>

21
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,989
trying to get measurements for his

22
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,850
experiments but for instance a couple

23
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks ago someone was posting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they'd</font>

24
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:57,690
lost a link from one of their providers

25
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,099
and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought maybe the provider</font>

26
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,210
hadn't withdrawn the routes they weren't

27
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,920
really sure they were asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

28
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:03,030
figuring out what's going on so these

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the sorts of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we're</font>

30
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:11,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at we started out by</font>

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,380
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the I plane data and</font>

32
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,780
seeing how often we saw global reach

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,229
ability being violated so on this graph

34
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,030
on the x<font color="#CCCCCC"> axis we have the fraction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

35
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:24,390
our bandages from which a prefix was

36
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,460
unreachable and it's a CDF so on the y

37
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,920
axis we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the cumulative fraction of</font>

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,658
sets of probes where a set of probes are

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,650
the probes to a given prefix on a given

40
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,060
day so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance we see that on more</font>

41
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,310
than seventy percent of the sets of

42
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,590
probes we have perfect reach ability the

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,950
zero unreachable<font color="#E5E5E5"> ax t but it falls off</font>

44
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,420
pretty quickly from there so if a prefix

45
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,860
is unreachable from one vantage point

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:49,950
it's highly likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be unreachable for</font>

47
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,329
many vantage points and based on the

48
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,920
knee<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this curve we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

49
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:54,449
that a prefix is experiencing reach

50

ability problems if more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than ten</font>

51
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,560
percent of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vantage's fail to reach</font>

52
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,149
so we saw looking at four<font color="#E5E5E5"> months of data</font>

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,860
that on<font color="#CCCCCC"> eighty-five</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the days</font>

54
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,170
between ten and fifteen thousand

55
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:07,759
distinct prefixes had problems and over

56
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,430
the course<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our study out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,780
110,000 prefixes that we monitored

58
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,710
79,000 of them had problems at least

59
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,030
once so

60
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:17,880
we're seeing lots and lots of problems

61
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:23,280
on most prefixes having problems at some

62
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:24,870
time so we're starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to design the</font>

our troubleshooting so when we see a

of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> first where's the last hop</font>

98
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,480
somewhere further upstream in another

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">a.s we can also ask where other</font>

advantages able to reach the destination

101
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:45,360
at that point in time we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look at</font>

102
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,900
whether the origin was single or multi

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,970
homes we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to predict the next hop</font>

104
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,040
so we can look for paths that reached

105
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,510
historically through that same last top

106
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,920
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just observed or paths that are</font>

107
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,450
currently reaching from<font color="#E5E5E5"> other bandages</font>

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,589
and see if we can predict it if we're

109
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,179
able to predict where it should go next

110
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,280
we can check of that next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hop is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

111
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,840
live we can also ask you know is it in

112
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,400
the origin ask where is it located and

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,270
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can assess whether or not the</font>

114
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:14,070
path contains loops so we've recently

115
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:15,690
been done an evaluation of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> real time</font>

probed<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1500 prefixes every 15 minutes</font>

118
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,590
for two weeks and we observed over a

119
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,180
hundred thousand problems and we're able

120
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:25,739
to automatically classify more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than half</font>

121
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,420
of them as they occurred and we're

currently using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simple classic</font>

00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:38,070

have to explain all of the failed<font color="#CCCCCC"> traced</font>

last top that we see or it could be on

145
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:20,850
the return path and we're currently

146
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:22,170
using six classes so the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> class</font>

147
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,060
that we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

148
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">call the single home origin a.s down so</font>

149
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,960
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a prefix p that's our</font>

150
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,659
destination it has an origin a s and

151
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,840
we're seeing a single provider a for

152
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,390
that origin ass and in this class we

153
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,489
have no probes successfully reaching the

154
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:40,680
origin is but a<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of probes are</font>

155
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:42,840
ending up in the provider and this

156
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,880
explained<font color="#CCCCCC"> 31 of the problems that we saw</font>

157
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,049
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> thirty one percent of the problems</font>

158
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,730
that we saw over the two-week period and

159
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,280
at any given point in time between six

160
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,500
and forty-eight percent the second class

161
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,599
now the origin is has the second

162
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,570
provider be or maybe more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than two and</font>

163
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,370
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing no probes reach the</font>

164
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,110
origin ass but probes are ending up in

165
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:04,920
the providers and this explains thirteen

166
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:09,090
percent of the problems that we saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

167
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:11,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first two classes were both complete</font>

168
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,780
unreachable ax t and the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

169
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,910
starting with this one are going to be

170
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,590
partial reach ability so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps</font>

171
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,820
more interesting some probes again three

172
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:20,099
we know things are working some places

173
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,450
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> not everywhere and the first class</font>

174
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,090
we're going to call provider a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

175
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:26,490
problems for a multihomed origin so here

176
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have all probes that go to provider</font>

177
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:30,060
be are dying and provider be but other

178
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,640
probes are reaching through the other

179
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,900
provider and this explains sixteen

180
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,800
percent of the classified<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems and</font>

181
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,859
for us this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the more</font>

182
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,660
surprising results you know one of the

183
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,100
main reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for being multihomed is to</font>

184
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,190
have resilience to failure

185
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,840
and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw this really commonly</font>

186
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,060
where one provider wouldn't be getting

187
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,349
traffic through and sometimes these

188
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,000
problems would last for days on end

189
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,170
where we continue to send probes they

190
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,640
would end up and provider being not

191
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:56,930
reach whereas other advantages we're

192
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,930
having no problem reaching the prefix

193
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:04,380
next class is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar here we have</font>

194
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,850
another ASC that's not a provider for

195
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,510
the origin it's somewhere upstream from

196
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,430
be all probes that enter see are failing

197
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,870
and we have some probes that are

198
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,610
reaching other ways either through a<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

perhaps through be<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> explain twenty</font>

200
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:21,600
one percent of the problems so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

201
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,730
four classes that we looked at we're all

202
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,620
cases where the problems were sort of a

203
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,850
s wide any probes entering a particular

204
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,070
a s<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're failing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach the target</font>

205
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:31,410
but as we saw in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bull gun filter</font>

206
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:33,659
talk earlier it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always sufficient</font>

207
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,770
to look at things<font color="#E5E5E5"> an an AS level</font>

208
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes you have to look on a router</font>

209
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,330
level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what the last two</font>

210
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,950
classes give so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have some a s</font>

211
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,760
that's upstream from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the origin and</font>

212
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:46,710
there's a router are in that a s all

213
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,349
paths through our are failing to reach

214
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:51,270
the destination we have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> historical</font>

215
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,470
paths that reached through our so we

216
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,299
have some idea of where the paths should

217
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,060
be going and there are other paths

218
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,830
through that same a s that ours in that

219
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,510
are avoiding<font color="#CCCCCC"> our and hence reaching the</font>

220
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:04,590
prefix so this explains six percent of

221
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:06,990
the problems that we saw our last<font color="#E5E5E5"> class</font>

222
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,609
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> very similar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

223
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,860
historical paths that reach through our

224
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,360
so it's some sort of new path and it's

225
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,650
not working and this explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty</font>

226
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:18,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">six percent of the problems that we saw</font>

227
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:21,179
so to quickly summarize those results

228
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,730
from our automatic classification over

229
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:25,920
the two-week period about<font color="#CCCCCC"> forty-five</font>

230
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:27,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">percent of them fell into classes 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">2 which were the complete on</font>

232
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,710
reachability problems and to highlight a

233
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:34,710
couple of interesting points on the

234
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,689
partial reach ability we saw sixteen

235
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:38,070
percent falling into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> class three</font>

236
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,990
where there's some problems going on

237
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,270
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-home failover and then</font>

238
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,940
looking at class five and six we saw

239
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:46,350
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were problems with a</font>

241
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,290
the destination it was much more likely

242
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be on a new path rather than one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

243
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:55,020
has had historically been working

244
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,420
this analysis that I just gave was just

245
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,430
on 1500 prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we're now working</font>

246
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,170
to scale up this analysis to the entire

247
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,930
internet but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do</font>

248
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:06,089
traceroute to every prefix from every

249
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:07,949
destiny every vantage point constantly

250
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:09,270
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do some intelligent</font>

251
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,370
target selection we're going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintain</font>

252
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:13,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp information and we're going to use</font>

253
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,660
pings to responsive prefixes to check

254
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:17,010
reach ability we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then use</font>

255
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,779
these updates and pings to help us

00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,040
select prefixes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are likely to be</font>

experiencing problems at a given point

00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,449
in time so either prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

slide giving a graph on reach ability

00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:32,130
analysis on the high plane data we saw

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that if one traceroute failed to reach</font>

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,990
ping is likely to predict problems this

267

is ongoing work and we plan to evaluate

at this summer so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> conclusion we saw</font>

lots of reach ability problems and

00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:48,330

specific problems that we've seen thank

Randy bush on aij um back one slide the

<font color="#E5E5E5">what the reach ability problems that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">associated with prop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> multi-home failover</font>

305
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,370
could you do an analysis to show the

306
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,240
length of<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that they weren't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long</font>

307

<font color="#E5E5E5">lasting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and correlate with bgp data for</font>

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:26,840
those of us who are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop route</font>

310
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,320
type of analysis we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do I haven't</font>

311
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">looked at it specifically for multi-home</font>

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,180
fell over but we did do some analysis of

313
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:41,660
how bgp updates correlated with outages

314
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:43,550
um<font color="#CCCCCC"> oon I'm sorry but and and well so we</font>

315
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,199
found that that bgp was only sufficient

316
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,349
to explain a third of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems we</font>

317
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,510
saw but that a third of the short terms

318

or you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't think we did the</font>
