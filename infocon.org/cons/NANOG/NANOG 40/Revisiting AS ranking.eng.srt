1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:09,809
ok hello so today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will show you a work</font>

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:12,240
on a s rankings so i will get a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:16,580
Rico alone inter domain which ability

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,580
handled by the BGP protocol then i will

5
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:23,778
give some motivation about this study

6
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:26,820
about a s rankings and then i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

7
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:32,159
present you the new approach two wrong

8
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:33,540
guesses and finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will show an</font>

9
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:48,449
overview of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> club of the</font>

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:51,059
classification thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok let's go so</font>

11
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet network is a set of</font>

12
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:58,559
interconnected autonomous systems so

13
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:02,160
we've got stabbed networks I mean it's

14
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,518
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> modern client esa that's only sent</font>

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,070
and received traffic for themselves

16
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,890
we've also we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also got internet service</font>

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,100
providers so they provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> shunted for</font>

18
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:18,450
other guesses and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet network</font>

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:22,048
is also a partition of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public IP</font>

20
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,409
address space so the range of addresses

21
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:28,670
are called prefixes so we've got

22
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:33,090
prefixes for companies users

23
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:37,229
universities and so on and so the

24
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,049
routing from the a s to the prefixes is

25
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:43,259
under by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP protocol as you all</font>

26
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,799
know it so bgp<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reuters are responsible</font>

27
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:50,700
to propagate it to propagate announced

28
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,740
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rich ability of prefixes and the</font>

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,640
Reuters maintain huge routing table

30
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,699
toward all the prefixes so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

31
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,369
connectivity can be defined<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the fact</font>

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,490
that each<font color="#CCCCCC"> fruta would know a route</font>

33
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:10,739
toward any public IP address for the

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:12,400
routing to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so doing the</font>

35
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">end-to-end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roots in the</font>

36
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,689
let's rely on the BGP route selected and

37
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:22,450
propagated by Reuters and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root of</font>

38
00:02:19,689 --> 00:02:27,730
bass inside each es is matter only of

39
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:29,950
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP of this of those a yes but the</font>

40
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,018
BGP route selection and propagation rely

41
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:36,250
on two important<font color="#CCCCCC"> things for the topology</font>

42
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:38,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the bishop e</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routes that would be</font>

43
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:42,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">propagated and selected depends on the</font>

44
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">es level map and also the route on level</font>

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,730
topology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this selection strongly</font>

46
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:52,179
rely on routing policies so<font color="#E5E5E5"> how prefix</font>

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:55,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">are announces announced how the filters</font>

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:00,280
are set in configurations and how the

49
00:02:55,569 --> 00:03:03,548
preferences are also set<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that</font>

50
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:07,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">was a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wreck or so that was a</font>

51
00:03:03,549 --> 00:03:10,030
technical part and now we all know that

52
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:12,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet is a huge business place so</font>

53
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,760
we've got business agreements between

54
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:18,548
aces we've got agreements between

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:22,629
customer and provider so the client pays

56
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:29,590
for incoming and outgoing traffic to a

57
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:32,649
provider of the first Kim shows it so in

58
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:36,069
terms of BGP the client will send its

59
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:39,359
client route and the provider will have

60
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:42,250
to send all<font color="#E5E5E5"> its roots to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the client</font>

61
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:45,099
we've also got<font color="#E5E5E5"> another agreement called</font>

62
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:47,139
peering relationship but you you all

63
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:51,339
know it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw I love pairing t-shirts</font>

64
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:55,479
here so peering usually it's no money

65
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,519
and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say no guarantee the</font>

66
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:02,949
particularity of those agreements that

67
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:06,190
we we haven't got any transits between

68
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:10,449
pairs we are the peer relationship only

69
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:13,949
support<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing between clients of</font>

70
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:17,560
clients so the result there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are also</font>

71
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,150
other relations I mean original peering

72
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,810
from

73
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:26,580
pureeing IP prefix based relationships

74
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:33,030
to access some some prefixes sibling

75
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:37,620
relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so far for the point</font>

76
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:42,448
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> view of an ISP to to decide for new</font>

77
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,729
links to maintain some wings we have we

78
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:49,500
would have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the rich ability of</font>

79
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:52,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">aces I mean which bgp</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paths are used or</font>

80
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,220
will be used to prefixes so those paths

81
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,740
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> depend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on many unknown factors I</font>

82
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,680
mean business agreements traffic

83
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,850
engineering concerns and the network

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,340
dynamics of by G of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP and this rich</font>

85
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,370
ability is so important<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

86
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,710
implies the underlying quality for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

87
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:18,599
data plane of course we all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

88
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:23,150
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so given any s business agreements</font>

89
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:27,240
you've got with your neighbors and and

90
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:30,150
the past your neighbors guts to prefix

91
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:33,930
it it shapes your possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> past with all</font>

92
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:37,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards the internet so to accurately</font>

93
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,949
negotiate newlings ought to maintain

94
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:44,849
actual links we would need knowledge

95
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:47,610
about which prefixes and which was will

96
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:51,539
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> provided when I mean which prefixes I</font>

97
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:55,289
mean we will I have cheaper prefixes

98
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:57,930
with this new<font color="#E5E5E5"> peer which hostel</font>

99
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,699
belonging to prefixes am i close to

100
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like</font>

101
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:06,510
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what kind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp paths will i</font>

102
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:09,960
get two of those prefixes I mean will

103
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:12,810
other stable nothing like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so all</font>

104
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,979
this kind of information is relatively

105
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:22,099
unknown and so the real impact of a new

106
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:25,099
link is unknown so negotiations are

107
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:25,099
complex

108
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:33,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so to motivate this work so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

109
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:36,819
rankings adjust the classification<font color="#CCCCCC"> of es</font>

110
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:41,410
es it's a way to compare several ases I

111
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:43,900
mean transit ISPs so it's to get another

112
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:46,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">view</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the year shekhar position so</font>

113
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,250
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the economic position in the</font>

114
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,979
internet and another view of the

115
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:54,280
topological position so which

116
00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:59,979
connectivity can i<font color="#E5E5E5"> get with a neighbor</font>

117
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:03,219
is so this so the rich ability of those

118
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:05,949
candidate is is strongly correlated to

119
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,650
the petition in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ER she so the</font>

120
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:13,030
customer provider relationships they the

121
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:16,359
shape whole packets will flow oh I've

122
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:20,320
got an animation but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't</font>

123
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:25,960
work so this network shoe should be

124
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:28,419
transformed into a pyramid<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:34,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">another view of past works about es</font>

126
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:36,340
rankings so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> all approach we are</font>

127
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:40,570
based on what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can call bgp tomography</font>

128
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:44,619
so the idea is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a public data for</font>

129
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:48,280
example from<font color="#CCCCCC"> route views so we've got so</font>

130
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:52,210
many bgp pass to prefixes from many

131
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,280
vintage yeses and with those data with

132
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:59,258
those paths we try to estimate the

133
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:02,619
petition of nes in this internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> yash so</font>

134
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:04,840
to do that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got many were proposed</font>

135
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:08,590
we've got what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i call black boxes</font>

136
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:11,710
because algorithm are not public so

137
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:14,440
we've got net configs rankings fix a

138
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:18,250
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and Renesys that is well</font>

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:22,979
known so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they they do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

140
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:26,680
publish how they how they rank yeses

141
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:30,610
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> uranus these people can can say</font>

142
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:32,860
the contrary<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know so we've got</font>

143
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,000
also research works on the internet

144
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:37,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">yoshi I'm</font>

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,669
work from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gale rock from subramanian so</font>

146
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:42,340
there are many other works so I just put

147
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:46,150
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> fork on it so they try to</font>

148
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:50,860
infer the Yoshi composition from those

149
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:54,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp tables and we also got kada rankings</font>

150
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,680
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a I heard it is a bit out of</font>

151
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,890
date but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really know</font>

152
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,189
about it so the our main goal was to

153
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:05,740
compute<font color="#CCCCCC"> the size of customer cones what</font>

154
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:09,720
we call customer cones that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

155
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:12,550
of graphics is behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> an S</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

156
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,260
prefixes of their clients and clients of

157
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:21,189
clients so prefixes<font color="#E5E5E5"> they provide in fact</font>

158
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:23,740
so the metrology was to infer s level

159
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:26,830
connectivity of the internet then to

160
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:29,860
infer business agreements and then with

161
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:34,120
those business agreements they can infer

162
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:37,510
the size of the cone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so last</font>

163
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,910
approach we can say that linear algebra

164
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:43,839
approach so it's purely great based

165
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:47,260
approach we've got a French approach 1

166
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,920
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> clever so they try to analyze the</font>

167
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:54,040
matrix of the AAS connectivity we've got

168
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:59,680
a recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach from wong and i'll so</font>

169
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:03,150
it's a it's about the same idea of using

170
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">the matrixes of connections between ESS</font>

171
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,589
so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are many issues</font>

172
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,430
in the estimation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s rankings and</font>

173
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:14,260
many rankings are not accurate first

174
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:16,900
what we can say is graph-based metrics

175
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:20,890
that are not taking care of policies so

176
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:24,069
they are out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scope because bgp pass</font>

177
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:28,000
they will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never be sure to space there</font>

178
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:30,520
are policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> bus we all know that so for</font>

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">example between a sensuality number of</font>

180

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:42,430
coefficient and so on they don't work

182
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so next if we try to use bgp</font>

183
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,620
tomography I mean VIP pass to prefixes

184
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:51,610
to estimate the rich ability of

185
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,589
all the ases it's not accurate one more

186
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,080
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we've got a small number of</font>

187
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:59,680
measurement ases and we've got a strong

188
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,480
BS in the data so we cannot say only

189
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,329
with root view drive data and some

190
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:07,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking-glass data we cannot infer all</font>

191
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:11,529
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> paths from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all the ases so because</font>

192
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:17,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">we do not see any perfect</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do not see</font>

193
00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:20,170
enough prefixes and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> match all of</font>

194
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:22,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">these data from the vantage ases we've</font>

195
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,339
got some indicators overestimated I've

196
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:29,190
got a concrete example for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

197
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:33,850
court the a s from court is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 8220</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

198
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:36,940
8220 so yeah we can see prefixes going

199
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:40,240
from one to one to court and going to

200
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:42,370
another chair once so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make all</font>

201
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,060
data and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't take care of prefixes</font>

202
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:51,610
you can see this yes making transit for

203
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:53,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tia ones and it does that for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> such few</font>

204
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:57,670
prefixes but if you forget prefixes

205
00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:02,080
that's what you can infer with I mean

206
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:05,290
blind algorithm blind graph algorithm so

207
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,000
and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we use infrared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

208
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:11,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">relationship to ensure customers as</font>

209
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,810
guided do that we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not fairly</font>

210
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:16,000
accurate because the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of</font>

211
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:20,260
inferring business relationships either

212
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:24,450
is a degenerated problem I mean so many

213
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:27,870
solutions exist to the inference problem

214
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:31,990
so Kate algorithm can provide solutions

215
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:34,750
but so many solutions have the same cost

216
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:39,480
regarding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> optimization result and</font>

217
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:44,110
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> model of agreements is too coarse to</font>

218
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:49,180
identify the complex reality of

219
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:52,839
agreements so what what we propose to

220
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:57,010
mine this data to infer accurate

221
00:12:52,839 --> 00:13:00,420
rankings so we still use<font color="#CCCCCC"> a the fields</font>

222
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:04,950
from reduce from ripe from looking

223
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:09,899
food as we we are we have about 100

224
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:11,970
cases full routing tables so our goal is

225
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,820
to estimate the amount of customer

226
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">prefix provided but each</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS so the same</font>

227
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:21,540
goal as<font color="#E5E5E5"> kada but we do not want to rely</font>

228
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:24,388
on business relationships we do not want

229
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:27,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the BS in the data introduced by the</font>

230
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:29,760
small set of measurement points and we

231
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,339
would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a freedom on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

232
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,260
to give importance to prefixes I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

233
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:39,149
wait prefixes based on content for

234
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:41,550
example so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep in mind this BS in</font>

235
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:43,860
the estimation of amount of prefix we

236
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:48,060
can observe in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> graph in the whole</font>

237
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet so we know we cannot infer</font>

238
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:57,810
accurately prefixes seen by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a SS and we</font>

239
00:13:53,910 --> 00:14:01,350
cannot fairly accurate accurately in

240
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:04,439
fair prefixes on links so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

241
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:09,390
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is to infer the amount of</font>

242
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:12,260

243

ability has to be maintained by every s

244
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:19,920
so transit provider will be responsible

245
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,010
for the propagation of anons or

246
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,430
flexibility so we will still see those

247
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:28,620
announces from any vantage points and

248
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:31,890
the transit provider will be seen on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

249

route to customer<font color="#E5E5E5"> pro fixes so we are</font>

250
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:41,449
sure of that we will always see that so

251
00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:48,990
we propose<font color="#E5E5E5"> two splits pass we observed</font>

252
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:52,439
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I give an example a pass x wz t to a</font>

253

00:14:52,440 --> 00:15:01,790

255
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:06,839
transit for prefix p and the second is Z

256
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:10,050
Z are also transit for the prefix p so

257
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:13,290
given<font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of pass we can compute a set</font>

of prefixes transited by a

<font color="#CCCCCC">is so those prefixes transited</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as those</font>

260
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:26,130
seen on a soup path of length free I

261
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:33,810
call them<font color="#CCCCCC"> tripit and the rank of NES</font>

262
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:40,290
will be the average amount of prefixes

263
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:44,250
of i'm in space transited by a SS so we

264
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:46,680
split the set of input pass for each

265
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:50,130
vantage point for each vantage point we

266
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:52,439
compute the prefixes transited and then

267
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:59,310
we get we compute the average of this

268
00:15:52,440 --> 00:16:03,569
rank<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so here is a something for the</font>

269
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:10,560
understanding so<font color="#E5E5E5"> given the vantage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font>

270

four or so and from another<font color="#E5E5E5"> path 5347 we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">with the other vantage point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s4 so we</font>

00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:27,130
him transit to its customers so what we

290
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:30,430
extract from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data is a</font>

291
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:33,280
fact information but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got a vintage</font>

292
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:35,980
as close if we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an eye as close to a</font>

293
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:39,370
Muslim on TS we can see him transit so

294
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:45,220
many things so this will be push it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

295
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:48,040
by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> average thing so we can say we</font>

296
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:52,630
strongly read you the BS due to the

297
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:56,100
placement of measurement points and and

298
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:59,080
we still keep the prefix granularity so

299
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:03,750
the transit of some prefixes between two

300
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:07,659
TR ones will be push it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sew and</font>

301
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:14,290
finally to compute this average IP space

302
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:19,890
transited by HS is quite we can see

303
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,889
quite accurate given a sample of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 ESS</font>

304
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:26,379
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an overview of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the results so</font>

305
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:30,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">I do not compare these results to other</font>

306
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:34,750
rankings I should do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's just</font>

307
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:37,179
to get another<font color="#E5E5E5"> view of that and just</font>

308
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:40,420
when I look at other rankings I can see

309
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,310
some ases getting into this top top 20

310
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:45,730
and they should not belong<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this top</font>

311
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:49,139
20 and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my rankings I think they</font>

312
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:52,450
should all belong to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this list and</font>

313
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,330
what's funny is for the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

314
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:58,650
company open transit if we can if we

315
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:02,949
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rankings of other other</font>

316
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:05,260
other rankings we can be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> 25-30</font>

317
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:07,180
things like that and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a look</font>

318
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:10,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this ranking that should reduce the</font>

319
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:19,630
BS and reduce many things<font color="#CCCCCC"> I explained we</font>

320
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:23,520
are 13 so this benefit us also ok so

321
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:26,230
here is the second part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list and</font>

322
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,929
I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the names of the ESS I</font>

323
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:33,080
just get a data from some

324
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:37,999
from who<font color="#E5E5E5"> is databases and it's not quite</font>

325
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:40,360
accurate names<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so to conclude with</font>

326
00:19:37,999 --> 00:19:42,980
this work we<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduce a new algorithm</font>

327
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,729
so it's still based on bgp tomography

328
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:50,659
things we use bgp feeds and we we need

329
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:54,710
root views to do that so we record a

330
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:57,490
foreign transit of prefixes by ESS so

331
00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:01,070
the value computed can be directly

332
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:04,039
interpreted for example if we take level

333
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:08,110
free though so from the point of view of

334
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:11,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">my algorithm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> labelled free seems to have</font>

335
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:18,019
fifteen percent of the space behind him

336
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:24,559
that's quite big so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this ranking is</font>

337
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:27,230
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

338
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">advantage compared to other methods it's</font>

339
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:34,159
like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a black box it's a</font>

340
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:37,689
something public and it take care of the

341
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:42,320
BS so the overestimation of some things

342
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:44,269
push it out or average we can say we

343
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,759
take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the multi vantage</font>

344
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:50,980
points so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more vantage points we get</font>

345
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:54,889
the more accurate we will be maybe and

346
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:59,629
finally i can say instead of computing

347
00:20:54,889 --> 00:21:02,240
the the IP space percentage we can use

348
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:04,759
relative importance of prefixes we can

349
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,659
wait prefixes based on the content to

350
00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:11,090
get another rank to give so to give a

351
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:15,259
nice rankings<font color="#E5E5E5"> that should take care of</font>

352
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:17,059
the so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bgp data and also the comp</font>

353
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:22,419
the data from the contents<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside of</font>

354
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:22,418
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you very much</font>

355
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:33,240
thank you Michael um any questions I

356
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:40,330
would be grateful that feedback about

357
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:45,400
that because so many black boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist</font>

358
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:55,389
and I feedback from<font color="#CCCCCC"> is PR people that</font>

359
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:57,610
negotiate agreements will be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

360
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,130
thanks we're ready for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next speaker</font>

361
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,459
oh sorry question over it all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

362
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:06,820
Roger<font color="#E5E5E5"> camp and switching data packs I'm</font>

363
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,680
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it Dunn's some kind of analysis</font>

364
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:13,770
pre-analysis of something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

365
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:17,710
using this method and wanted to know if

366
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:20,889
what the results were as of preliminary

367
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:24,070
analysis when you did did this to him

368
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:27,760
doing this current method who came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up at</font>

369
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:29,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">the top and came up at the top yeah</font>

370
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,940
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your question is who came up at</font>

371
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:37,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">the top yes so you mean those top 20 or</font>

372
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,380
those others

373
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,320
and when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to operational people</font>

374
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:51,180
from France Telecom they told me they

375
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,200
they have the impression that level

376
00:22:51,180 --> 00:23:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">three was very high and I can say its</font>

377
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:05,070
first Randy Randy<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bush</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i J um I mean</font>

378
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">like want to talk to some of the</font>

379
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:11,100
operators around and see if their

380
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:20,430
impression of that ranking approximate

381
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:23,370
so their impression of reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> i doesn't</font>

382
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:28,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">match mine doesn't match what do you</font>

383
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:29,729
think no there are some anomalies there

384
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,090
that are hard to believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you go to</font>

385
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:38,130
the next foil<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe which one you</font>

386
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:45,379
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> next box re hit down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

387
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:45,380
702 is number 25 702 is was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> uunet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> law</font>

388
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,760
just they're just things

389
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and their gills</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> quienes is hard</font>

390
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,320
there is a reason bit of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah and</font>

391
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:05,830
the reason is that up you are comparing

392
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:10,240
apples and oranges in short how you

393
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:13,199
cannot meaningfully compare providers

394
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,000
who operate in different market segments

395
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,920
there is a different metric for retail

396
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,040
providers there is a different metric

397
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,040
for wholesale providers and say the

398
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,220
largest tier ones including<font color="#E5E5E5"> including</font>

399
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:30,370
entity<font color="#E5E5E5"> our providers provide as we would</font>

400
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:33,640
say and in each case a different metric

401
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:35,889
applies to a more accurately account for

402
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:39,750
the relative position in the market<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

403
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:42,490
if is this metric applicable to prefixes

404
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:44,530
in each case<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> weighted by traffic</font>

405
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:47,050
mean by prefixes in this case yes so

406
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,149
with my algorithm week you can put

407
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:51,280
weights and prefixes and yet secondary I

408
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:54,250
was you want yeah and second division is

409
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,530
by geographic regions yes you cannot

410
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:59,260
meaningfully compare say global<font color="#CCCCCC"> networks</font>

411
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:01,570
to original or continental networks it's

412
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,580
a second yes didn't buy markets you can

413
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:06,070
apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> other data to this algorithm</font>

414
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:09,699
because it's like a framework to commute

415
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:13,210
things because when we take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

416
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,760
customer prefixes provided by customer

417
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:19,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">coons provided by qaeda for example if</font>

418
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:22,570
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the data you will see many</font>

419
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:25,300
erroneous things because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i got inside</font>

420
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:28,270
and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the inferring</font>

421
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:32,290
relationships you get cycles of customer

422
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:35,139
provider relationships so every s on the

423
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:37,899
cycle get the same cone it's just an

424
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,780
example you've got an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> court</font>

425
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:43,330
and I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean your ranking was not</font>

426
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:46,600
good I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> when this algorithm was</font>

427
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:50,139
public and we could all benefit from

428
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:54,129
public things I mean so operators can

429
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:57,730
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ranking means exactly</font>

430
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,740
that that's the way it is computed we

431
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:02,620
all know it and we all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

432
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:04,580
limitations for example but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

433
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:07,219
it's better than

434
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,860
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can provide you a ranking</font>

435
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,620
but I cannot tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you because it's too</font>

436
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,459
complex<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I computed and there are</font>

437
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:20,658
reasons for the shelter's comment the

438
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:24,710
number of malformed or otherwise weird

439
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:27,620
our updates include the internet is

440
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:30,110
rather large if you don't have layers

441
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:33,320
upon layers of heuristics to remove

442
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:35,178
effects of leaks misconfigurations and

443
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,490
intended you know the aggregations and

444
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,840
such<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can come up with pretty strange</font>

445
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:41,299
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know whether they</font>

446
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:43,850
impacted your list but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a</font>

447
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,950
comment commentary yeah and I've got

448
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,769
I've got something to to reply to this

449
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:51,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fact this is computed using bgp</font>

450
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:54,320
tables and you're right in BGP tables

451
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:59,480
you've got some temporary things inside

452
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:02,600
but so in my PhD it's not in English I'm

453
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,659
sorry but I propose the methods<font color="#E5E5E5"> to so</font>

454
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,330
you can get successive bgp tables and

455
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:11,450
you analyze those successive tables and

456
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:16,000
you get the underlying stability from

457
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:20,210
that and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can also filter</font>

458
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,850
tombari announced backup links as you

459
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:26,570
can see them as backup I mean you can if

460
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:28,639
you see links only one time over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

461
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:31,580
tables you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say back up so you remove</font>

462
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:34,399
every route with these links so using

463
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:37,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">this you get so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> filter other</font>

464
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:40,639
input data and push it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> algorithm</font>

465
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:44,418
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Heidi of this algorithm is</font>

466
00:27:40,639 --> 00:27:46,340
really the framework of<font color="#E5E5E5"> computation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

467
00:27:44,419 --> 00:27:47,929
well I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a general comment but</font>

468
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:50,959
thank you there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot of lot of</font>

469
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:54,919
heuristics and things indeed I really

470
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,630
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ok bill I think</font>

471
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,730
a big part of what you're hearing from

472
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:00,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in the audience is that this is</font>

473
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially two thirds of the same</font>

474
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:06,260
analysis that Renesys does and that we

475
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:09,250
do and so forth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing that</font>

476
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:12,950
was published in the cook report in 2001

477
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:15,230
and the the basic issue is that this

478
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,980
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of topological analysis gives you a</font>

479
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:20,309
really good framework

480
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,440
and it's useless without the traffic

481
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:25,379
waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so the net flow exports</font>

482
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,059
that you flow into this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

483
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:29,210
a final ranking as close to a

484
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:31,440
topological ranking which really isn't

485
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,640
interesting by itself or it doesn't tell

486
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">you what you want to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing with your</font>

487
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,860
routing policy once you flow your

488
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,600
traffic into it and rear ank it that way

489
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it becomes interesting but it</font>

490
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,110
becomes interesting from a specific

491
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">point of view your point of view the</font>

492
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:48,030
person who exported that traffic right

493
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:52,100
you'll absolutely and that these

494
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:55,860
rankings fluctuate hugely by time of day

495
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:58,469
right by which I X you're exporting the

496
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,760
net flow stats from even within your own

497
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:05,130
a s you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things you see things</font>

498
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,650
bopping back and forth between you know

499
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:09,750
the top<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 and you know the two and</font>

500
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:13,290
three hundreds over the course of a day

501
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:15,480
so showing<font color="#E5E5E5"> any one ranking like this</font>

502
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:18,149
I've never found to be very useful

503
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,590
unless you're looking over a span of you

504
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:26,429
know months and over all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers in</font>

505
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:30,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">naas and even then it's just that is so</font>

506
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:33,179
you mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> trev traffic situations is not</font>

507
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,590
a friend to apply with algorithm I'm

508
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:38,820
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> because my English is not so</font>

509
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:40,770
perfect so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what what we found</font>

510
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,559
back when we were first doing this was

511
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:46,320
that we didn't see the list start to

512
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:49,080
stabilize until we started looking at 20

513
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,210
de windows okay right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> once you got</font>

514
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:53,879
out past a 20 day window of averaging

515
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,590
you'd start to see things<font color="#E5E5E5"> stabilize of</font>

516
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,900
course of a day I see but if you're

517
00:29:55,590 --> 00:30:00,510
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at like a 15 day window you'd</font>

518
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,929
see a huge amount of churn doing the

519
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:06,450
same report over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> course of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one day</font>

520
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:08,940
okay so you're right the fluctuation of

521
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">traffic's is you you ever get a small</font>

522
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:15,720
fraction of prefixes making the whole

523
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:18,479
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it fluctuates over time but I didn't</font>

524
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,580
know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take at least 20 days or</font>

525
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,010
more so you have to you you've got to

526
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,590
average the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic of our prefixes to</font>

527
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,549
reply to a ring I suspect how how big

528
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,320
that window is is also going to handle

529
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:31,690
how big the network is it's exporting

530
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,489
the data so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

531
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,580
huge number of variables here yeah

532
00:30:33,489 --> 00:30:38,830
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting analysis but yeah yes</font>

533
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:45,309
but uh and actually is better than

534
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:49,029
knowing nothing thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

535
00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:52,110
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you very much</font>

536
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:52,110
Michael thank you
