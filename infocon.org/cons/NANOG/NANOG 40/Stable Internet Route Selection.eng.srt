8
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:30,810
cause trouble at several layers both

the control plane processing<font color="#E5E5E5"> vgp updates</font>

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:44,209
can use at some routers a significant

18
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,780
one study for example showed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

19
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,500
rather than congestion causes the

20
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,619
majority of packet loss bursts so we'd

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,810
like to address these problems with cpu

22
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,630
utilization which makes routers more

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,479
expensive or delays convergence and also

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:28,908
with degraded path quality by making

25
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:31,229
paths more stable and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll describe our</font>

approach which were working on at

27
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,240
Berkeley so there is already a widely

28
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,640
deployed technique for improving

29
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,810
stability on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet and that is</font>

route flap damping unfortunately flap

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,820
napping comes with some pathologies and

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,229
reduces availability and I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

34
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:55,799
we had a live demonstration on Monday as

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,289
I understand it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has led the</font>

addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those problems flap damping</font>

40

those whose instability surpasses some

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:56,609
given a choice will prefer more stable

routes<font color="#CCCCCC"> / less stable routes taking this</font>

58
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:02,730
approach is going to lead to a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

59
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:05,400
challenges so first we have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

60
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,070
to locally infer the relative stability

61
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,630
of paths in order to make a good

62
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision or at least an educated guess</font>

63
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,160
because we don't want to modify the

64
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,430
routing protocol and send additional

65
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,549
information there's also the issue of

66
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,519
dependence so path selection on the

67
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:28,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet is a cooperative process among</font>

68
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,200
the ISPs so if only<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few ISPs are</font>

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,140
optimizing for stability their benefit

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,480
may be limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> if none</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other ISPs</font>

71
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:41,899
are interested in doing that and finally

72
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,359
perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> most important importantly</font>

73
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,920
taking the approach of optimizing

74
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,780
stability by using flexibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> and route</font>

75
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:53,190
selection is going to lead to trade offs

76
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:59,880
because that flexibility is also used

77
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:02,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">optimized for for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> path length so</font>

78
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,579
in the rest of the talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

79
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:09,200
discuss the design of staple route

80
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:11,910
selection how we how we implement it and

81
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,010
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> evaluation based on simulation</font>

82
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,810
highlighting these three challenges that

83
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,950
I described and I'll conclude so in the

84
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet today if you have a choice</font>

85
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,539
between multiple paths in BGP you follow

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,060
a decision process like that one

87
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,560
what I'm showing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this is a</font>

88
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,100
slightly simplified version of what

89
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,750
happens in reality so if you have two

90
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,550
paths and you're choosing<font color="#CCCCCC"> between them</font>

91
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,850
you'll first pick the one that has

92
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,670
highest local preference second if

93
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's still the tie you pick the one</font>

94
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,980
with shortest path length and so on so

95
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:50,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">what we're proposing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is to replace</font>

96
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:53,500
some of these steps with the step<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

97
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:56,610
will optimize for stability preferring

98
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:58,780
paths that are less likely to fail soon

99
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,490
now in principle you could do this at

100
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,489
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> step of the decision process and</font>

101
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,610
it's in some routers it's actually done

102
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:10,090
already fairly low in the decision

103
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,250
process the approach that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

104
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:16,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">take for this talk is to replace path</font>

105
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:19,750
length with a heuristic for stability

106
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,909
which will pick paths at the a s level

107
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,960
and then we'll return<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the other steps</font>

108
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:28,440
in the decision process so it's

109
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,810
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we use a heuristic that's</font>

110
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:34,900
simple and an efficient so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be</font>

111
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:37,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">implemented on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a router although we've</font>

112
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:39,190
investigated several what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll use in</font>

113
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,130
the results here is the following so

114
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:45,450
first stick with the route that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

115
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:48,159
using as long as it's still available

116
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,780
second if you're forced to switch then

117
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,720
pick the available route with shortest

118
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,900
path length and finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> if there's still</font>

119
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:00,790
at I pick the oldest route one with

120
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:01,989
longest up time now in the simulations

121
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,400
i'm going to show you we actually have a

122
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:06,130
simplified environment where we have

123
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,169
only a single simulated router /

124
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:10,300
autonomous system so this results in a

125
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:12,460
somewhat simplified decision process

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:15,490
that's here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i won't go into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> detail about</font>

127
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:17,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let's see how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these different</font>

128
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,360
strategies perform so i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show</font>

129
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:22,659
you an evaluation based on an

130
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,730
event-based simulator of bgp fed by a

131
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,650
number of measurements of the internet

132
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:30,460
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a topology at the a s level</font>

133
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:33,299
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said with one simulated router /</font>

134
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,070
autonomous system to about 21,000

135
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,720
simulated routers local preferences

136
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,070
inferred from customer provider peer

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:45,190
relationships

138
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:47,290
and a SC jet excuse me a trace of about

139
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:49,780
a year in length of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> se Jason see</font>

140
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:53,080
failures inferred from route views and

141
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:58,270
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> primary metric that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

142
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">be evaluating is interruptions in terms</font>

143
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,590
of measuring stability so an

144
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:05,130
interruption is a change in a route or

145
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:09,880
withdrawal of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> route basically a flap</font>

146
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:12,520
so interruptions are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a proxy</font>

147
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:15,990
for metrics that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about</font>

148
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,789
namely<font color="#CCCCCC"> load on routers or packet loss</font>

149
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:23,130
but using interruptions allows us to

150
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:23,130

151
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:29,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so let's get right to the results and</font>

152
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:32,560
see how well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do with this kind of</font>

153
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,780
an approach so what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show</font>

154
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,090
you is the mean rate of interruptions

155
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:39,520
per month per source destination pair

156
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:43,150
and also the loss and<font color="#E5E5E5"> availability</font>

157
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:46,299
relative to standard bgp so standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp</font>

158
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,799
no flap damping gets about 26

159
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,170
interruptions per month in this

160
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">environment and of course no loss and</font>

161
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:56,710
availability relative to itself turning

162
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,650
on flap damping you do get a significant

163
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:02,289
improvement<font color="#CCCCCC"> in stability but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this comes</font>

164
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:05,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the price of measurable loss and</font>

165
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:10,780

00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:13,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I described so interestingly stable</font>

167
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,369
route selection can perform even better

168
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,380
in terms of the mean rate of

169
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:21,030
interruptions without ever turning off a

170
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:25,120
route<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it has the same availability as</font>

these techniques flap damping<font color="#E5E5E5"> and srs</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">complimentary now interestingly if you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I've shown you are based on a full</font>

me all<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS is running these strategies</font>

187
00:09:09,579 --> 00:09:16,300
so what happens if we have only a

188
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:18,910
partial deployment so this plot shows in

189

192

202
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,480
perhaps debatable but this point is

203
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:58,449
actually the average over all autonomous

204
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:02,430
systems and some perform much better for

205
00:09:58,449 --> 00:10:07,120
example the tier ones shown here in red

206
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:09,189
dots I'll explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> this plot by example</font>

207
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:13,829
so each one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these red dots is a</font>

208
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:16,510
particular tier<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 so AT&T for example</font>

209
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:19,060
according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this simulation gets about</font>

210
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:21,250
17 interruptions per month in standard

211
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:25,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP and this could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be reduced by a</font>

212
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:31,000
factor of 3.5 by turning 80 and no other

213
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:32,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISPs turned on stable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> selection so</font>

214
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,230
this shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the tier</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones benefit</font>

215
00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:38,380
significantly more on average than the

216
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:40,810
other ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> when unilaterally running a</font>

217
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:44,139
stable route selection and this is

218
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:46,810
because they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more flexibility which</font>

219
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:48,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">brings me to the final section of the</font>

220
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,739
evaluation that I'll talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

221
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,639
flexibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that's also</font>

222
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,430
needed or useful for performing load

223
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,649
balancing among providers or satisfying

224
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,120
business relationships minimizing path

225
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:02,740
length and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the question is what</font>

226
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,600
is the trade-off with these other

227
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,160
objectives

228
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,550
so at the high level we have kind of

229
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,170
continued a continuum here between

230
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,689
either more flexibility for stable

231
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:16,000
routing versus more flexibility for

232
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:20,290
other objectives so standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP gives</font>

233
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,540
no flexibility to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability and we've</font>

234
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:26,829
already seen that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we satisfy business</font>

235
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:29,230
relationships and give the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of the</font>

236
00:11:26,829 --> 00:11:30,250
flexibility to stable route selection we

237
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,180
can get about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a factor of five</font>

238
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:37,060
improvement and the big<font color="#CCCCCC"> open question is</font>

239
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,649
how much improvement do we get with a

240
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,689
realistic amount of flexibility

241
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:42,690
realistic traffic engineering and so on

242
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,380
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're</font>

243
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:50,230
unfortunately unable to quantify with

244
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,990
the data we have as it involves private

245
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:56,529
policies so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interested in</font>

246
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:58,810
collaborating with industry folks to

247
00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:01,060
quantify this<font color="#CCCCCC"> well we can quantify</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

248
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:04,329
this data<font color="#E5E5E5"> set that we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> however is</font>

249
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:08,439
path length so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a CDF</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of path</font>

250
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:10,239
length in standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP and that's what</font>

251
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,300
it looks like with stable route

252
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,370
selection so interestingly path lengths

253
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,258
really don't increase very much at all

254
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,800
only about four percent more on<font color="#E5E5E5"> average</font>

255
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:22,540
and this is for several reasons first

256
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're taking into account path length as</font>

257
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,230
a component of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our heuristic and also</font>

258
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,969
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this environment path</font>

259
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,949
lengths couldn't get much longer do the

260
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:34,959
constraints of the customer provider

261
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:38,680
pure relationships<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

262
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,849
summarize what I've told<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so I've</font>

263
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,758
described the stable route selection

264
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,899
which is an approach to use flexibility

265
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:46,329
and passed selection<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order to</font>

266
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:48,310
optimize for stability so our

267
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:49,719
preliminary results show that it is

268
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:51,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible to make the internet</font>

269
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,589
significantly more stable using this

270
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,930
approach without impacting availability

271
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:59,589
and with<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low stretch that is very</font>

272
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,560
low increase in path length what we're

273
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:04,810
working on now is a implementation and

274
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,160
software router and test bed based

275
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:09,758
deployment in order to get more

276
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,709
realistic performance results now let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

277
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,899
conclude with one of the main reasons

278
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:17,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm here at nanog I've already got</font>

279
00:13:13,899 --> 00:13:21,279
some great feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> from many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

280
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,229
were but we're interested in a number of

281
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions and here are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the main</font>

282
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:30,880
ones first how useful and practice is

283
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:33,300
stability for us operators second what

284
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,740
would be the barriers in practice to

285
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,199
deploying implementing employing a

286
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,120
scheme like this for example is non

287
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:44,519
determinism in route selection something

288
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,690
that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very detrimental and</font>

289
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,029
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> if those barriers could be</font>

290
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,100
overcome how much flexibility would

291
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,600
remain for stability this is something

292
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,000
i'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quantify for example in</font>

293
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:02,350
terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average number of routes</font>

294
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:04,209
available route options available so

295
