5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:26,550
we have been running<font color="#E5E5E5"> ipv6 for some time</font>

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,099
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little clarion call</font>

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,130
to let you guys know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,040
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and and in in some of the places</font>

9
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:41,040
where we're focused on and how ipv6 is

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,440
is being supported here first a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,289
bit of our operational experience we've

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,199
been running dual stack at the core with

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:53,760
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> routers since 2002 with six phone</font>

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,270

that in proper space from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron all of</font>

20
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:24,720
we met fruit has had a unofficial /

21
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:27,060
official ipv6 address and at least

<font color="#CCCCCC">one-third of our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> effort mirror nodes</font>

around the world are ipv6 enabled

24
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:36,450
basically when we go into a new node we

25
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,089
find out if they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a v6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> peering</font>

27
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:47,729
v6 on that node so currently right now

28
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:50,040
we're about<font color="#CCCCCC"> one third we've got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple</font>

31
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,029
on an experimental basis or in our

32
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,508
production basis and so we'll go ahead

33
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:05,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">and add add the announcement of the v6</font>

34
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:09,360
address then the one bit of that I've

35
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:12,140
learned in doing this is a bull avoid

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,140
eui-64

37
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,810

configure the address then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nick goes</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it taking forever to log on and then</font>

41
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,000
find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out oh crap the mac address changed</font>

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,950
which meant the eui-64 address changed

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:39,330
and nobody ever remembered this to

44
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:41,700
update the quad a record darn so the big

the operational side has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been ipv6</font>

five of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 13 root servers have quad a</font>

52
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,390
you look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route that zone file</font>

53
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,520
you'll notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are our igloo</font>

54
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:20,220
records in place for several of the

55
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:24,900
ccTLDs and gTLDs including the ones

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,500
listed on on my slide due to the special

57
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,110
role that that the root servers have

58
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:34,880
perceived or reality there there has

59
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:39,380
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> many concerns expressed about just</font>

60
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:42,840
recklessly just adding v6 glue records

61
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:45,930
basically a lot of it stems from sending

62
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">Iggy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Enescu gene s0 queries sending</font>

sending responses bigger than 512 512 k

64
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,619
or private adult bytes and so forth so

65
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,600
there have been several studies

66
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,610
commissioned to make sure that there

67
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">were no serious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> side effects before just</font>

68
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:06,420
turning this on and the committee's

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,049
listed on the slides there they spent

70
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:13,079
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> six months looking at this and</font>

71

00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:03,340
they have support for quad a records or

86
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:06,080
they do v6 transport in the case of bind

87
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:10,070
all of our major transport options have

and in regards<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dhcp software there</font>

91
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:21,950
are several products out there and

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prague and where they found while</font>

101
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,050
there were some little nagging issues

102
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:59,919
there they all basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter operated</font>

they all interoperate between each other

104
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,330
we were asked not to reveal who actually

105
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,780
participate in the bake-off so that's

106
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,440
why they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not less here so but there's</font>

107
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:18,919
a link to the report on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IETF website</font>

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:22,340
about the results so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion while</font>

109
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,890
the ipv4 Grim Reaper your Reaper isn't

112
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:32,450
the distance and it's heading this way

113
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:35,539
maybe not very fast at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment but by</font>

114
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:38,560
the by the look of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron statement</font>

115
00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:41,030
it's heading this way

116
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,830
we do advocate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you at least try</font>

117
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:45,260
ipv6 on your own network and a

118
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,690
small-scale test I mean I'm not sitting

119
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:51,409
here advocating that<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube turned up</font>

120
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:55,449
ipv6 anytime soon but at least test it

121
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,100
check it never see what what see<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

122
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:01,280
items and products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the perhaps</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have v6 capabilities we're from</font>

124
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,070
mainly a hosting environment in this

125
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:10,039
case so most of our tools are pretty

126
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:13,699
much pretty much geared toward EV for

127

is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say it is but part of</font>

144
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:15,260
it is is is just from our aspect we

145
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,729
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a large enough insulation at</font>

146
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,680
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now to justify using dynamic</font>

147
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:22,610
dns so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more of an</font>

148
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,770
overhead for for us internally but yeah

149
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,139
other otherwise yes please use dynamic

150
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:30,729
dns but for<font color="#CCCCCC"> our use internally at least</font>

151
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:33,620
at the moment it's not really worth it

152
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:36,439
David Davidson University of Washington

153
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:38,240
so in your view eui-64 is mutually

154
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:41,779
exclusive with static addresses as

155
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,820
opposed to deploying both or turning you

156
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:45,500
I 64 on and then applying statics where

157
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,450
you actually have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a server</font>

158
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,370
service yeah for where we have a server

159
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:56,070
service we do static

160
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:57,839
and basically you can do either what we

161
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:00,900
do right now because we're relatively

162
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,260
small entity we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically put the prefix</font>

163
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:06,270
and then the last before octet you could

164
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,250
I've seen other entities do where they

165
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,529
embed the VLAN information and the

166
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,400
switchport information into it you can

167
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:15,980
come<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with your own addressing scheme</font>

168
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:20,880
basically right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now we just stick static</font>

169
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:22,920
v6 addresses on our servers and and and

170
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,140
just let<font color="#CCCCCC"> it be like that because then</font>

171
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,589
that way it's stable at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our</font>

172
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,689
perspective yeah so what we've what I've

173
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:32,580
seen done is implement a 64 and then

174
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">apply a static address on the systems</font>

175
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,640
that are running services yeah a

176
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:42,089
potential yeah Jill hold on Jill over

177
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,040
there oh sorry mark coasters verisign I

178
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">like Peter if you go back to that one</font>

179
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,750
slide had talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about iono putting</font>

180
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">cuates in her route that's kind of a</font>

181
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:53,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit Rosie because the testing</font>

182
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,080
wasn't entirely comprehensive and

183
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,959
there's tons of middleboxes out there

184
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:00,480
that intercept DNS traffic we have no

185
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea what's going to happen to those so</font>

186
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,270
there there is some concern they're not

187
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,829
huge concern but there is some concern

188
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,300
yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's basically as I</font>

189
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:11,370
said the ball is now in their court and

190
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,680
there is still a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sensitivity</font>

191
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:20,520
about it so this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a long process</font>

192
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,529
at least so 23 years going it needs to

193
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,890
be actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be advertised a bit</font>

194
00:10:22,529 --> 00:10:27,930
more to a larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> community because it's</font>

195
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,970
pretty small right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> even dealing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

196
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,880
that yeah all right Joel<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pretty</font>

197
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,830
good is the next speaker in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room mr.</font>

198
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,350
cod4 you go there you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll stay come</font>

199
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,800
on up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Joel go ahead yeah um two</font>

200
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,839
observations one if you deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> v6 mail</font>

201
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,390
servers at this point like there are a

202
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,209
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it but they</font>

203
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:52,740
are looking for your v6 PTR records as

204
00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:55,260
well so you do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do reverse and so</font>

205
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,150
that really does you know incentivize

206
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,710
you to either do dynamic dns or

207
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,689
statically configure

208
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:02,610
your actual servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what you do with</font>

209
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,820
your clients is obviously your business

210
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:09,900
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other observation I would make</font>

211
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:13,050
on this is that you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

212
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,670
experienced the same thing but there was

213
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,170
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of commentary on the list in the</font>

214
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,530
last couple of weeks that there are no

215
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,900
tools for managing your ipv6 deployment

216
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:23,880
and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody who's worked on these</font>

217
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:28,079
six deployments for about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years now I</font>

218
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:31,770
was unaware that there were no tools you

219
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:34,290
know and the tools that most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us use</font>

220
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:37,199
which were developed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> people like ISC</font>

221
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:39,599
arm and you know other people in the

222
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:44,700
community things like nagios actually do

223
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,830
by and<font color="#E5E5E5"> large support ipv6 so they are</font>

224
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:52,490
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> for use for experimentation</font>

225
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,490
and deployment thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you Peter</font>
