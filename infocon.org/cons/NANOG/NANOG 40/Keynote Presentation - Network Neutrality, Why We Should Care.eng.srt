dealt with telcos worker telcos in the

past know that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about the</font>

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,170
intelligent network which provides every

13
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,090
service that every user could possibly

14
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,239
want you plug in your stupid telephone

15
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,829
and it does things for you this is kind

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,629
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opposite viewpoint which maybe</font>

17
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,329
wasn't met with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greatest reception</font>

18
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:48,269
from what we've actually called the bell

19
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:53,239
heads but it kind of defines what we do

20
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:56,010
for a living so you could expect perhaps

21
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would commit here here will be</font>

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,940
interesting maybe a little controversial

23
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,160
hopefully a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fun and definitely</font>

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,580
discussion provoking so without further

25
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:15,229
ado David good morning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> welcome hello</font>

talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you guys you know I'm</font>

29
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:43,710
supposed to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the internet</font>

30
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,710
sorry I I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I can do that</font>

31
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,570
especially that<font color="#E5E5E5"> special part of the</font>

32
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:54,670
inner that that lives at layer 3 I never

33
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">knew there was so much at layer 3 I</font>

34
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,700
always<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was the thing that</font>

35
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:05,580
made the Internet stupid was layer 3 and

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:09,070
I find out boy am I wrong so what I

37
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:11,200
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more I haven't done I</font>

38
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:15,100
haven't written<font color="#E5E5E5"> a line of code or done a</font>

39
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:19,660
technical job in over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years I left</font>

40
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:23,950
Bell Labs<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years ago but what I do</font>

41
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:30,959
tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about is the intersection</font>

42
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:33,820
of corporate culture business<font color="#E5E5E5"> models and</font>

43
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,510
economics and regulations stuff like if

44
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:44,548
law stuff like that as it affects the

45
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:48,488
Internet and networks in general and I

46
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:51,840
had to look no speaking of corporate

47
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:59,519
culture I had to look no further<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

48
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:59,519
this hotel last night to see how

49
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:08,850
permeating the culture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local</font>

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:13,390
corporations are around<font color="#CCCCCC"> here I was</font>

51
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:17,170
sitting<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my bed trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change the</font>

52
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,000
channel on my TV and I went push push

53
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,768
push push out and then the channel

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,799
changed and then I go push push push

55
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:26,260
push push push and the channel would

56
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,569
change and I went and this thing needs

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,030
batteries so I called up

58
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:34,149
the engineer came up and the engineer

59
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,129
tried to convince it he said um this TV

60
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:42,489
isn't like your TV at home it has

61
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">special features and I yeah so you know</font>

62
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:47,319
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so then I said no</font>

63
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:49,659
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> please change batteries and push</font>

64
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:51,159
push push and it still didn't work and

65
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,560
he went well you have to push a button

66
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:55,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">really carefully like this and he walked</font>

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,519
right up and pushed the button and and I

68
00:03:55,689 --> 00:03:59,260
could see that he was still pushing it

69
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,639
three or four times to get it to change

70
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:07,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">but so then so then I said look good</font>

71
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:09,699
could you please fix it and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> went well</font>

72
00:04:07,449 --> 00:04:11,230
I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to my manager so he five</font>

73
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,139
minutes later the phone rings I picked

74
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,120
up this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the manager and I said well</font>

75
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:24,669
the TV's broke and he said well the TV

76
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:28,599
has certain issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to</font>

77
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,909
say bellevue isn't just a just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

78
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:32,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">microsoft culture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i walked into</font>

79
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:35,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">the apple store across the street and</font>

80
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:37,120
there was a woman breastfeeding and I

81
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,630
could smell the funny smoke wafting out

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,630
of the back<font color="#CCCCCC"> room so the multicultural</font>

83
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:53,080
anyway so you probably have all heard

84
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:57,070
about network neutrality and if you

85
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,530
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> of if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of sitting there</font>

and tweaking bgp or whatever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font>

88
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:13,229
the router what what you know if you

89
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:16,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of that as just a regular job then</font>

90
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,340
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk won't be really too</font>

91
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:23,020
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> too but if you think of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

92
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:27,130
as you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my passion my life</font>

93
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:30,250
this is why<font color="#CCCCCC"> I exist i'm at the i'm</font>

94
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:33,840
surfing down the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> wave of history</font>

95
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:39,760
right now because the internet is

96
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,500
special and wonderful that's the then

97
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:44,320
this talk is for you

98
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:47,220
and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact if you're not sure I'm here</font>

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:52,420
to remind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is</font>

100
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:56,770
special and wonderful and completely

101
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:58,870
unprecedented in human history even

102
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,060
though there are parallels history

103
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:07,450
doesn't repeat Mark Twain said but it

104
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:13,660
rhymes so where the whole talk revolves

105
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:18,550
around two antithetical questions we net

106
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:21,970
heads<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask how do we change network</font>

107
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:24,280
service provisioning so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

108
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:28,750
survives because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is</font>

109
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:33,280
actually in deep danger right now once

110
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:37,860
upon a time radio used to be primarily

111
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,780
an amateur medium now it's been totally

112
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporatized than three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or four radio</font>

113
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:48,700
stations<font color="#E5E5E5"> radio compass station companies</font>

114
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:52,240
owned all of radio and<font color="#E5E5E5"> TV and newspapers</font>

115
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:57,570
used to be completely amateur and

116
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:01,630
democratized and now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few large</font>

117
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:05,229
corporations<font color="#E5E5E5"> own most of the newspapers</font>

118
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:09,130
sure you can find amateur radio if you

119
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:14,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">look in the corners and sure you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

120
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:18,070
find amateur publications if you look in

121
00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:25,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the corners and go to the offbeat book</font>

122
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:31,150
shops and university towns but and we

123
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:34,299
face the clear and<font color="#CCCCCC"> present danger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

124
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">little but it's true we faced a clear</font>

125
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:39,820
and present danger that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the that the</font>

126
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,979
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool stuff the democratizing</font>

127
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,870
stuff about the internet this health

128
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:47,469
expression all that is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

129
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:50,349
pushed into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corners into the free</font>

130
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,840
speech zones with barbed wire around it

131
00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:54,820
that are out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the mainstream we're</font>

132
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,989
sure you can have free

133
00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:01,870
speech kid just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't bother us with it</font>

134
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:03,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so there really is a danger so we</font>

135
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,440
had so there's two different questions

136
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,599
on the table for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those of us who are</font>

137
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,700
paranoid enough to and that's not

138
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">necessarily a bad thing ask Andy Grove</font>

139
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,599
those of us who are paranoid enough to

140
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,810
believe that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> danger</font>

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:24,160
ask how do we change service

142
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:27,250
provisioning so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as we know</font>

143
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,710
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and love it survives and doesn't get</font>

144
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:32,110
pushed into a corner meanwhile<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

145
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:36,098
telephone companies and cable companies

146
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:39,280
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are legitimately feeling threatened</font>

147
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:41,710
and pushed into their own corner go how

148
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:47,500
do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the internet so we survive</font>

149
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:51,100
and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two incompatible positions</font>

150
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:53,410
is there a compromise maybe I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't</font>

151
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:58,750
seen it yet there is a common<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

152
00:08:53,410 --> 00:09:02,189
and that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> creation of operating</font>

153
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:07,690
models that give us a stable sustainable

<font color="#E5E5E5">internet where all the good stuff is</font>

155
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:16,990
preserved now the internet is better

156
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:21,780
than the broadcast networks the

157
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:27,000
telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> network the cable network</font>

158
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> general-purpose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any app</font>

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:35,560
over any physical medium network it's

160
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,430
better than application specific

161
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,530
networks because it allows for I don't

162
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:44,890
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really tell you this allows for</font>

163
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,020
application discovery put code on the

164
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:48,790
net send it to your friends try it out

165

<font color="#CCCCCC">if you like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it maybe other people</font>

166
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:56,020
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> too ok but then market discovery</font>

167
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:57,760
you find out who else wants it and this

168
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,040
you have the application without

169
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,600
permission people know about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

170
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,430
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it all the time but market</font>

171
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:08,130
discovery I think is more important it's

172
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,709
totally slippery

173
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:14,060
low-cost way of finding a market that

174
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">you didn't even know existed before and</font>

175
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:22,229
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> because the locus of control is</font>

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,520
at the edge no hierarchical<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporation</font>

student will there be others you bet

183
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:52,050
there will be unless we change the locus

184

of control so that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> barriers to</font>

what you can put on the internet and the

186
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:03,930
first step in changing the locus of

187
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:07,350
control is<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this application fits in</font>

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,930
this silo that application fits in this

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,780
silo oh here's a new application which

will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a miracle that</font>

create they know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these markets</font>

198
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:47,780
and all these applications but they

199
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,780
didn't bring them to market we did

200
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:55,740
because we could just put it out there

201
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:58,140
without permission without gatekeepers I

202
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,440
don't mean sip I mean political

gatekeepers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's not forget that</font>

204
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is about more than just</font>

205
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,980
commercial applications it's about

freedom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> speech freedom of the press</font>

just freedom Charlie<font color="#E5E5E5"> NESN who's the</font>

he's wrong so um you guys probably like

220
00:12:54,719 --> 00:13:02,819
to see data here's some data collected

221
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:06,739
by physicists but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically what that</font>

222
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:10,618
says is that packet losses are

223
00:13:06,739 --> 00:13:12,749
decreasing approximately one order of

224
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:15,179
magnitude every five years which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

225
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:17,459
approximately Moore's<font color="#E5E5E5"> law and it's doing</font>

00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:20,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">so over all different kinds of networks</font>

and all<font color="#E5E5E5"> different kinds of circumstances</font>

228
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:27,839
the internet is just getting better

00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:32,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">folks here's another one a TCP</font>

with Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> law leave it alone and the</font>

233
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:42,449
thing gets better of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys</font>

234
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:44,929
wouldn't say leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> alone my ass we</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">are doing it and in fact that's true but</font>

236
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:57,899
and that's good so in other words the

00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:59,968
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet is doing real real well it's</font>

244
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:22,949
is nobody plans its growth and there's

245
00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:28,819
no business model<font color="#CCCCCC"> a return on investment</font>

246
00:14:22,949 --> 00:14:31,289
or any of that crap in other words it is

00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:34,540
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the telephone company</font>

company<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the cell phone companies</font>

250
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:44,980
they limit growth they want to sell be

251
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:49,200
if they if things weren't scarce they

252
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:52,210
wouldn't have anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sell they</font>

253
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:55,600
strictly gate the technology based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

254
00:14:52,210 --> 00:15:00,790
depreciation schedules they own it and

255
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:04,630
they damn well know what they got they

256
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:09,430
plan very carefully how it grows to the

257
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:11,770
percent at least they did until the long

258
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:17,620
hold times for the dial-up internet

259
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:19,480
evolved than<font color="#E5E5E5"> they and they have this you</font>

260
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,290
know they've got these business models

261
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:27,040
tuned out to the teen percent so here's

262
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:32,020
the big accident and that is that the

263
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who bring us internet access are</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the people who are most threatened by</font>

00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:41,530
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet okay so would the graphs I</font>

266
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:46,950
showed you about improvement those were

267
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:50,770
the core but the edge has big problem

268
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:54,820
places where it's allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to grow with</font>

269
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:57,790
technology where the telephone companies

270
00:15:54,820 --> 00:16:02,590
have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliberately restrained from</font>

271
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:04,599
restricting it like Japan and Hong Kong

272
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:07,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> play you got a hundred megabits for</font>

thirty dollars a month symmetrical

274
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,950
growing two gigabit 10 gigabits 40 you

275
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:19,620
know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's but here they're still</font>

276
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:24,030
selling scarcity and the reason is that

277
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:29,140
they're threatened they're losing their

278
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:30,970
buds to that well they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there they</font>

279
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:36,189
see that they're afraid they're going to

280
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:42,040
lose their butts to skype youtube you

281
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:44,820
know views all all those applications

282
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,920
that used to be built<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the very</font>

283
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,460
center and essence they didn't call them

284
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,479
tell

285
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:54,250
phone poles for nothing they were

286
00:16:51,480 --> 00:17:04,540
vertically integrated pieces of the

287
00:16:54,250 --> 00:17:08,170
network so back in 1993 I had a very

288

could kill the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they did but</font>

293
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:31,840
actually now that well Dave Clark of

298
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:51,790
who was the last CEO of the real AT&T

299
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:54,790
the one who brokered the deal to sell to

it said emails a feature the email web

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:03,040
browsing these are all features that

303
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,020
nobody pays for and we have to carry

304
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,530
them what we need network president

305
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:12,639
applications well by 2003 in other words

306
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:16,030
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally starting to get what</font>

307
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">ed whitacre became famous for in 2006</font>

308
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:21,460
when he said they're not drowning you as

309
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:24,520
my pet referring so the telephone

310
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:26,620
companies meanwhile beak not just

311
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:29,440
because of the internet because<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

312
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,389
they they ramped up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> capacity to deal</font>

313
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,700
with the dial-up internet they put a lot

314
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:37,630
more dial-up ports and they increase the

315
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:40,750
hold times in their model and then the

316
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:45,490
cable company started offering fast

317
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:47,650
access that wasn't dial-up and the

318
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,290
reason the cable companies went zooming

319
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:52,330
ahead wasn't because dsl was an

320
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:55,690
underdeveloped technology it was because

321
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:57,850
the telephone companies were wait we're

322
00:18:55,690 --> 00:19:00,340
sitting on their hands and waiting for

323
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:02,230
the extra voice ports that they put in

324
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:05,439
to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dial-up internet</font>

325
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:08,919
to depreciate and they didn't depreciate

326
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:12,510
fast enough anyway so the telephone

327
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:16,570
companies sold a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of second lines for</font>

328
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:21,220
internet and for facts and and then

329
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:25,439
along came the cable companies with

330
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:29,620
their fast internet access along came

331
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,679
the mobile phones that and people

332
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:34,659
started a van oord stop the second line

333
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:38,440
stopped growing and started falling off

334
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:41,799
and now<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are even abandoning their</font>

335
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:45,580
first lines of skype and you and vonage

336
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:49,629
and so on are coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> along and so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

337
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,790
project sort of the last few data points

338
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a year old i</font>

00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:58,210
had was lazy and didn't update it before

340
00:19:54,130 --> 00:20:01,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">i came but the eighty percent intercept</font>

341
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:06,330
is well within and that's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font>

342
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:09,790
you I can wave my arms 8020 rule okay

eighty<font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of the customers generate</font>

344
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,809
or twenty percent of the customers

345
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:19,600
generate eighty percent of the revenues

abandoning first because they're heavy

348
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:30,480
users early adopters etc and so when in

349
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:33,880
by the by two thousand eleven or twelve

350
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,850
the telephone company landline business

351
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,870
will be defunct it'll still be going

352
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:43,990
there's still be copper<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop but they're</font>

353
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:47,290
in trouble and they know it by now<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

354
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,780
really know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they also see this</font>

355
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:53,590
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this may be motivating the more</font>

356
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:56,860
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market cap of verizon versus</font>

357
00:20:53,590 --> 00:21:01,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and verizon's is going down</font>

358
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:04,149
and Google's is going up so they see

359
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:09,580
that they have market cap<font color="#E5E5E5"> envy so the</font>

360
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">carrier's starting in well starting in</font>

361
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:16,029
the late 90s for sure but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

362
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:21,580
got serious in tooth out

363
00:21:16,029 --> 00:21:24,429
and three and in 2003 after you know as

364
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:29,649
the as they were digesting the telecom

365
00:21:24,429 --> 00:21:32,229
bust they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the FCC and they said</font>

366
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:38,049
the only way we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in fiber</font>

367
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:45,239
is if we don't have to share<font color="#E5E5E5"> it fiber in</font>

368
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:49,179
the local loop FCC said fine then and

369
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:52,359
then there was the brand x decision

370
00:21:49,179 --> 00:21:56,909
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided whether cable modem access</font>

371
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:58,718
to the internet was was a

372
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:01,629
telecommunication service or an

373
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:05,200
information service and they decided the

374
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:07,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">Supreme Court decided in really twisted</font>

375
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,960
logic that it was an information service

376
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,939
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> though the definite if you read a</font>

377
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">common-sense definition it would say</font>

378
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:20,099
exactly the opposite lower court said it

379
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:26,309
was that the connection part was a

380
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:30,279
telecommunication service but nope it so

381
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:34,359
so Brand X privatized cable and then we

382
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:37,239
few weeks later Kevin Martin said well

383
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:39,070
gee the telcos need a level<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing</font>

384
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:43,839
field in fact if you look at Kevin

385
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:47,139
Martin the head<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FCC everything he</font>

386
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:49,239
says about innovation is about the

387
00:22:47,139 --> 00:22:54,478
ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> for telephone companies to</font>

388
00:22:49,239 --> 00:22:58,149
innovate so they can do what cable do

389
00:22:54,479 --> 00:23:01,599
that's it that's how Kevin understands

390
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:05,408
innovation so it once<font color="#E5E5E5"> again two</font>

391
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:08,289
different questions we net heads<font color="#CCCCCC"> esque</font>

392
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:10,539
how do we change network service

393
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:13,749
provisioning specifically internet

394
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:16,149
access so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet survives and the</font>

395
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:19,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">telephone companies are saying hey what</font>

396
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:22,629
about us we want to survive even if we

397
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:26,889
have to change the internet and the

398
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:27,830
common problem still is the sustainable

399
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:38,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">intern</font>

400
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:41,389
so in 2006 shortly after EDD<font color="#CCCCCC"> Whitaker's</font>

401
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:47,390
famous they ain't gonna use our pipes

402
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:55,720
for free statement free press and move

403
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:58,789
on and a bunch of other more bipartisan

404
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:08,110
organizations took up the cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

405
00:23:58,789 --> 00:24:12,889
network neutrality network neutrality is

406
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:17,658
prohibits it prohibits internet access

407
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:21,408
service that treats different traffic

408
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:24,110
differently neutrality says<font color="#E5E5E5"> you treat</font>

409
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:29,779
all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic on level playing field</font>

410
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:34,039
so by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of 2006 we won this great</font>

411
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:36,769
victory limited great victory battle

412
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:41,750
great victory not war great victory but

413
00:24:36,769 --> 00:24:44,929
the victory was in the AT&T bellsouth

414
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:48,980
merger we got language in it that said

415
00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:52,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for two years the merged ATT</font>

416
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:55,960
bellsouth wouldn't this wouldn't provide

417
00:24:52,940 --> 00:25:00,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet access service that privileged</font>

418
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,380
degraded prioritized any packet based on

419
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,000
its source ownership or destination

420
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,580
that's a pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good definition of</font>

421
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,159
network neutrality and here's another

422
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:13,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">one that the telephone companies offered</font>

423
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,919
we won't block impair degrade content

424
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,620
applications or services<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was said</font>

425
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:24,049
by Walter McCormick in Congress in

426
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:26,059
February of 2006 but he said but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

ain't the internet we got today it's

435
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,370
dynamic and moving and expanding and

436
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:51,370
improving so and I say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

437
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:55,419
neutrality it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the absence of</font>

438
00:25:51,370 --> 00:26:01,860
deliberate anti-competitive action by

439
00:25:55,420 --> 00:26:07,830
the carriers so here's an old slide that

440
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:10,479
I've had in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my computer for 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

441
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:15,060
when you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network of different</font>

442
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:18,670
networks it pushes the value<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the edge</font>

443
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:21,129
you used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the intelligent network</font>

444
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:22,960
with the value in the middle well when

445
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network of different networks</font>

446
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:30,550
there's this lowest common denominator

447
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:35,560
thing happening and you well so in the

448
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:37,870
old way ss7 when you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> up a call it</font>

449
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:42,040
touched every node in every network so

450
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:45,550
any network owner was free to add cool

451
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:47,470
features to their network so that it

452
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:52,200
would be more competitive than a

453
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:56,260
competing Network bed old<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network d and</font>

454
00:26:52,200 --> 00:27:00,150
as a result people would<font color="#E5E5E5"> favor network</font>

455
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:04,600
see but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

456
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:08,170
different kinds of networks the cool

457
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,300
features any network specific difference

458
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:12,520
you want to ignore<font color="#CCCCCC"> it route around it</font>

459
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,639
you want to do the lowest common

460
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:20,260
denominator which is just deliver the

461
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:22,360
biz stupid now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know it's more</font>

462
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:25,290
complicated than that but if you're

463
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,449
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> down on layer 3 from the</font>

464
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:30,490
application I know you guys are doing

465
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:34,990
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> magic on layer 3 but when you look</font>

466
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:38,110
down on layer 3 the layer 3 provides a

467
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:43,390
clean interface embodied in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

468
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:46,629
header that you know you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

469
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:51,460
really nice little tightly well-defined

470
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:52,540
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything goes so I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

471
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:55,460
stuff

472
00:27:52,540 --> 00:28:00,950
coke bottles into the payload of my

473
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:03,050
packet you guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care and maybe</font>

474
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll discover a market for coke bottles</font>

475
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:13,040
so but in the old in the old so so what

476
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:16,340
that what this slide says is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

477
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:23,420
old paradigm of adding network specific

478
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:27,649
features such as call waiting caller ID

479
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:31,460
stuff like that those become totally

480
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:37,010
obsolete and even interfere with the

481
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:39,080
idea of value at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> edge so the stupid</font>

482
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">network is a neutral network I'll say it</font>

483
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,169
another way stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> Network supplies</font>

484
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:48,910
simple connections and the services<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

485
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:51,230
all created by network-enabled products

486
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:53,450
designed for whatever network

487
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:57,500
application you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want and you just bring</font>

488
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,960
them home and plug them in I just like

489
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,600
the graphic I'm sorry I know I'm

490
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:08,480
repeating myself here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business</font>

491
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:11,750
view of this the the old telephone

492
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,460
company paradigm they sold the

493
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,350
application the ability to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make a</font>

494
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:17,960
telephone call is what people bought

495
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:21,409
they didn't buy explicit they didn't buy

496
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:23,480
a share of the wire or a piece of the

497
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:25,670
telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> pole or a piece of the switch</font>

498
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,950
in the central office they paid for the

499
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:32,720
ability to pick up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone and call</font>

500
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:37,730
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> so but that application because</font>

501
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,620
it was connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a telephone which</font>

507

00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:02,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">other stuff the fact that they provide</font>

509
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:09,479
internet access is an accident

510
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:12,659
in the new paradigm the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application can</font>

511
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:15,209
be anything any app<font color="#E5E5E5"> over any network the</font>

512
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:18,779
network layer provides what's called a

00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:20,940
portability layer and the physical layer

514
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:25,469
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the any network part of any up any</font>

516
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:30,329
for this stuff and if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't pay</font>

517
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:32,820
then advertisers will pay for it no

518
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:34,709
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with applications people love</font>

there's a whole ecology there but

524
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:53,849
there's a big question about how that

525
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:56,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical layer gets provided in the</font>

cellular companies provide who are used

00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:15,149
completely different business model and

532
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:19,739
companies don't change<font color="#E5E5E5"> business models</font>

535
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:32,039
in a near-death experience kind of way

536
00:31:27,049 --> 00:31:34,109
but it's almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> like 89 I'm sorry</font>

542
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,119
make money on stupid connections the

543
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:57,178
middle of the network is empty the stuff

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> used to be scarce is now plentiful</font>

545
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:03,779
there's guys out there selling 55

546
00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:06,599
gigabit boxes I've got a gig connection

547
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:09,569
on my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac you know how much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a gigabit is</font>

548
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:12,208
a gigabit is enough to serve the

549
00:32:09,569 --> 00:32:15,899
conventional telephony needs of a city

550
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:21,450
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand people</font>

551
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:26,160
as 10,000 is 640 megabits at 64 kilobits

552
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:31,080
so so a gig is enough to serve a hundred

553
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:34,860
thousand people so then you have a you

554
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,970
know 40 gig on a wavelength and you've

555
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:41,820
got a hundred wavelengths on a fiber and

556
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:45,830
864 fibers in a bundle and i did a

557
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:49,379
back-of-the-envelope calculation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

558
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:54,300
figured if all 6.5 billion of us were

559
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:58,260
off hook generating 64 kilobits and all

560
00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:00,860
that traffic came to this 864 fiber

561
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:05,850
bundle there'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a hundred dark fibers</font>

562
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:07,830
so and no so we're not bandwidth limited

563
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,830
anymore the stuff the telephone

564

566

that's the way they put the services

back in the middle of the network by

what that means is that the barriers for

hey just try out a new app and<font color="#E5E5E5"> throw it</font>

accreting bureaucracy around the

internet the innovation thing is gone so

607
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:38,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">let let's see I think I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said this</font>

608
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:41,620
already but yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> so despite okay here</font>

609
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,930
special-purpose networks discriminate

610
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,970
automatically if you pick up the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone</font>

00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:48,009
and it's verizon or quest through<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

612
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:49,359
guess here its quest you pick up the

613
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:52,510
phone in its quest you're using the

617
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:03,040
another telephony application no it's

618
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:06,040
wired and it's hardwired and this idea

619
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">of tying the application to the</font>

624
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:26,340
discrimination according to some

625
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:30,160
economists is economically efficient and

626
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:33,250
that imagine a traffic light okay

627
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:37,359
imagine a traffic light one guy sits at

628
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the traffic light and says hey no</font>

629
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:43,060
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll wait till the light turns</font>

630
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:45,940
green another guy says I gotta go I'll

631
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:48,070
your buck if I can just run the light or

632
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:50,860
you know really guys in a real hurry

633
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:53,230
type a guys give you a hundred bucks to

634
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:55,270
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to run traffic lights whenever I</font>

635
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:59,260
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to providing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there were safe way to</font>

636
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:01,660
do it but so if i were a traffic light

637
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:06,610
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would it would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my</font>

638
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:08,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">interest to figure out what the</font>

639
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:11,320
willingness<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay of each car was and</font>

640
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:14,500
rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have a traffic light</font>

641
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:17,380
which was stop or go<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would have all</font>

642
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,200
these gradations with different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of</font>

643
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,870
lanes and stuff like that and it would

644
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,720
get very complicated very bureaucratic

645
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:28,029
there'd be a huge billing mechanism

646
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,430
people you know a lot of people would

647
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:32,410
pay you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i might pay a bucket you</font>

648
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,359
know ten bucks a month to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

649
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:38,859
have preferred<font color="#E5E5E5"> service of traffic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lights</font>

650
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:42,640
but the point is it Rex the simplicity

651
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:49,750
that's made the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet the success</font>

652
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:53,620
that it is today so in closing we're

653
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:58,150
faced with two<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand-new questions one</font>

654
00:37:53,620 --> 00:38:00,640
is what we net heads<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask how can we</font>

655
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,940
change the process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

656
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:07,089
provisioning so the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

657
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:10,000
know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the simple stupid in the</font>

658
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:13,990
middle intelligence at the edge internet

659
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,480
how do we change service providers so

660
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:19,390
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know and love survives</font>

661
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,910
and the telephone<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies are asking a</font>

662
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:25,629
very different question how do we change

663
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:29,080
the internet so we the telephone

664
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:33,460
companies the obsolete buggy-whip guys

665
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:37,770
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 19th century maintain our</font>

666
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:42,130
business model and the common problem is

667
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:51,190
how do we create a sustainable global

668
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:54,570
internet for all of us so kids don't eat

669
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:54,570
this thank you

670
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,140
there are microphones but if I've

671
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:12,890
explained everything clearly please

672
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,330
don't use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm curious if your view</font>

673
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:17,680
is that the stupid<font color="#E5E5E5"> network is a</font>

674
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:21,020
low-margin network is a what low margin

675
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:25,490
absolutely absolutely if you think about

676
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:27,740
that traffic light again if you start

677
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:32,229
right now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's a</font>

678
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:37,100
switch on a timer but if you start going

679
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:40,640
this guy paid to run all lights all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

680
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:43,250
time this guy paid to just<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop and look</font>

681
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:44,900
and then go and these other people

682
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:48,350
they're willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to wait until light</font>

683
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:51,100
turns green think of the bureaucracy

684
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:54,620
you'd have to put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> place a to</font>

685
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:58,370
discriminate who's who<font color="#E5E5E5"> be to enforce it</font>

686
00:39:54,620 --> 00:40:03,170
see to collect from the various tiers of

687
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:07,700
certain you know and then what if a new

688
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:10,010
kind of vehicle comes along so yeah the

689
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:14,230
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simple and</font>

690
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:17,830
stupid is incredibly low margin the I

691
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,830
just happen to have

692
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:27,038
sorry well you can you can look at this

693
00:40:24,969 --> 00:40:31,869
too this is the slot these are the

694
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:40,229
slides i didn't use just let it wash

695
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:40,229
over you<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

696
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:57,629
up there's that slide again come on I'm

697
00:40:53,700 --> 00:41:15,270
sorry I'm this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working here oh</font>

698
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:17,400
there it was here it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is yeah the there</font>

699
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:20,640
were in that februari hearing at

700
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Congress this guy named Gary boo hula</font>

701
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,339
who's the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> affairs officer of</font>

702
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,660
Internet to you guys know him he's well

703
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:34,560
he said some amazingly important things

704
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:36,870
so let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just read from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> his testimony</font>

705
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:38,700
to Congress our engineers started with

706
00:41:36,870 --> 00:41:41,040
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> assumption that we should find</font>

707
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:43,529
technical ways of prioritizing certain

708
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,770
kinds of bits we<font color="#E5E5E5"> seriously explored</font>

709
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:49,890
various quality of service schemes but

710
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:52,740
all of our research<font color="#E5E5E5"> and practical</font>

711
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:55,799
experience supported the conclusion that

712
00:41:52,740 --> 00:42:00,569
was far more cost-effective to<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply</font>

713
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:02,250
provide more bandwidth<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay with enough</font>

714
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:05,010
bandwidth in that work there's no

715
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:10,740
congestion and video bits don't need

716
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:13,440
preferential treatment and he went on to

717
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:16,700
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> today our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abilene network doesn't</font>

718
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,560
give preferential treatment it does

Americans with an abundance of bandwidth

729

733
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:58,770
but if the provider insists on dividing

00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:02,640
it up into

actually in my view network ambivalence

745
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,600
you've shown two slides that show that

<font color="#CCCCCC">the performance of Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">first was going to college my stepfather</font>

752
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:57,000
an engineer asked me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

753
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">go study and I said aerospace</font>

engineering and he said<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I could</font>

mean I'm studying aerospace engineering

757
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:10,440
he said well aerospace engineers deal

758
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:15,360
specifically with performance and that's

759
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,760
their primary goal and my definition<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

760
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:20,430
an engineer is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a book what any</font>

762
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:24,839
some amount of economical drivers that

763
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:28,109
needs to be taken into consideration to

764
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:31,770
do good engineering internet engineers

765
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:33,270
have always strive to optimize the

766
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:36,210
network so where do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> draw the line</font>

767
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:38,250
between discrimination and good

768
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:44,280
engineering to optimize the network to

769
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:49,560
get the most value out of it um really

770
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:54,420
good question let's go right back to

771
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:59,490
that traffic light you look at the look

772
00:44:54,420 --> 00:45:04,020
at the cost of regulating the traffic

773
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:07,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> simplicity</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the service</font>

774
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:11,480
provided and then you look at the

775
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:15,020
aggregate benefit benefit to everybody

776
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:18,500
and you see whether a simple system or a

777
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:24,380
complex system works better for

778
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:28,369

they would need all<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinds of bit</font>

all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and countless theses</font>

application detection and discrimination

788
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:07,520
and so forth and they were aware of all

of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they concluded that in every</font>

793
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:21,160

not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always just bandwidth constraints</font>

your services such as video real time

my limited understanding and I admit

809
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:10,850
it's limited you can minimize jitter and

810
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:13,640
latency if you are just using<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few</font>

percent of a giant fat pipe and that's

00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:20,629
more simple but lets you know it let we

question exists now we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font>

866
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:05,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking about how to how to solve it and</font>

867
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:09,950
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve it in ways that preserve</font>

868
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:12,500
what's good about the internet so far

869
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:13,609
right and so what one we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> unlike so</font>

870
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:15,980
what's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of both a little bit</font>

871
00:50:13,609 --> 00:50:17,900
of capacity it's a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tweaks and</font>

872
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:20,210
what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to propose is that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> QSR</font>

873
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:22,010
stuff we were talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> from reports</font>

874
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:24,770
from people when<font color="#CCCCCC"> aveline and experiences</font>

875
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:26,720
ni to really don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe represent</font>

876
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:29,930
any of my own experiences using these

877
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,339
tools they have challenges given the

878
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,618
hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> juniper</font>

879
00:50:31,339 --> 00:50:36,349
doesn't have up until it recently things

880
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:39,470
with granular queuing that I thought I

881
00:50:36,349 --> 00:50:40,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">would find very useful they're generally</font>

882
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,470
useful they're not useful like Cisco

883
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,450
might be there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

884
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:46,160
differentiation among vendors in support

885
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:49,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">for these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things it's not uniformly bad</font>

886
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,690
or good across the board a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

887
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:52,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">can go a long way I'm not doing a lot</font>

888
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:54,559
here we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing just enough to make it</font>

889
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:56,960
survivable with you know foreign people

890
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:58,790
or 300 people on on a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

891
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,270
constraint resource I think this apply

892
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:03,920
as well to broadband access cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> DSL</font>

893
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:06,170
the whole bit I don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

894
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:08,750
neutrality can't be preserved for

895
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:10,309
political<font color="#E5E5E5"> application level things while</font>

896
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:11,990
the network still survives adequately

897
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:14,780
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being framed</font>

898
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:18,109
unfortunately in our representatives

899
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:25,420
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and that to me would</font>

900
00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:28,400
be a good solution thank you oh I'm I

901
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:33,520
think you guys probably know more than I

902
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:36,589
do about that my main concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

903
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:40,280
the baby stays in the tub when the bath

904
00:51:36,589 --> 00:51:42,470
water gets drained um unlike the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

905
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,020
couple of questions I do firmly believe

906
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:48,319
in the over provision if you've got a

907
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:50,960
young stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> network to be effective in</font>

908
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:53,599
need lots of bandwidth but we had a big

909
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:56,299
panel yesterday which basically shows

910
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:59,000
the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're facing for the first</font>

911
00:51:56,299 --> 00:52:00,650
time in<font color="#CCCCCC"> internets history that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

912
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">have enough bandwidth there is no</font>

913
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:05,780
technology that gives you cost-effective

914
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:09,559
greater than 10 gig technology in the

915
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:11,359
core and for the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> time it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

916
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:13,579
going to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> months late it's going to be</font>

917
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:17,540
years late I'd be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested to know</font>

918
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:19,220
your opinion on whether that potentially

919
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:27,230
threatens the future when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> troll</font>

920
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:31,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet um good good question uh I'm</font>

921
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:34,760
not aware I haven't seen those curves

922
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:37,250
that's what worries me yeah um do you

923
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:39,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the curves could I look at it could</font>

924
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:40,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> show them to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offline at the</font>

925
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,319
presentations that were given yesterday

926
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:46,730
Johanna look there's some nice graphs in

927
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:49,549
them good I'd be I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious to</font>

928
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:52,400
see that stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it really helped me</font>

929
00:52:49,549 --> 00:52:56,299
understand better what's at stake when I

930
00:52:52,400 --> 00:53:02,020
go and talk to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy people I would</font>

931
00:52:56,299 --> 00:53:08,230
love to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff and my answer is</font>

932
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:12,950
that I hope that the people who would

933
00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:18,260
restrict the internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> corporatize it</font>

934
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:21,169
and cut it off from most of us don't use

935
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:24,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">that fact against us I mean they are</font>

936
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:29,780
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at using you know the</font>

937
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:31,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">terrorist child porn drugs a thing you</font>

938
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:34,819
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they can get their hands</font>

939
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:37,779
on so I arguably they're trying to slow

940
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:40,549
this technology done already and well

941
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:44,900
back when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> started to give this talk</font>

942
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:50,270
six or<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven years ago you could still</font>

943
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:51,950
you could do of 40 gigabits over 40

944
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:53,839
wavelengths and now you can do 10

945
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:57,230
gigabits over a hundred wavelengths and

946
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:58,940
go further or 40 / but it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it hasn't</font>

947
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:04,310
really gone

948
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:07,280
as improved as fast as it has in the

949
00:54:04,310 --> 00:54:11,060
past so I'm thinking that yeah that

950
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:15,380
there's been the telecom nuclear winter

951
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:17,509
of 2002 probably took a lot of really

952
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,089
good projects and put them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shelf</font>

953
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:23,630
now I'm starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear 100 gigabit</font>

954
00:54:20,089 --> 00:54:27,380
ethernet but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd love to see the curves</font>

955
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:30,410
thank you yeah yeah this is andy oginski

956
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:33,349
from Renesys our internet to operates

957
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:36,500
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> a rather different business model</font>

958
00:54:33,349 --> 00:54:38,859
from our commercial providers it has

959
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,450
captive audience of state and

960
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:44,560
educational institutions it's heavily

961
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:47,390
subsidized how could you explain to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

962
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:50,060
why do you think lessons learned in

963
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:54,650
internet to apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the commercial</font>

964
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:58,549
world they were investigating how you

965
00:54:54,650 --> 00:55:01,339
operate a network cost-effectively they

966
00:54:58,550 --> 00:55:03,560
weren't investigating how you operate a

967
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:05,210
business model but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> were looking at</font>

968
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you operate a network so i think</font>

969
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:13,339
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's direct applicability in</font>

970
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:15,828
their findings it's like saying going to

971
00:55:13,339 --> 00:55:17,509
a university which is heavily subsidized

972
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:20,359
and not in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real world and all that</font>

973
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:23,290
and they found a cure for a certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind</font>

974
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:26,480
of cancer and they're not a

975
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:28,579
pharmaceutical company but still they

976
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:33,380
found a cure and it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

977
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:35,810
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to the findings i'm not</font>

978
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:39,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure how generalizable they are i think</font>

979
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:43,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're pretty darn generalizable they</font>

980
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:45,890
don't they don't they're they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

981
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:49,040
running a commercial enterprise you're

982
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:51,650
absolutely right but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

983
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:56,180
findings generalized to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">effective running of networks internet</font>

00:55:56,180 --> 00:56:04,009
networks run provo AT&T but<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably not</font>

986
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,109
the same one you're familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> no that's</font>

987
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:08,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">another company</font>

00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:11,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say that in 2003 were</font>

989
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:13,488
definitely not sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> on her hands many</font>

990
00:56:11,029 --> 00:56:15,680
of us<font color="#E5E5E5"> were receiving long overdue 271</font>

991
00:56:13,489 --> 00:56:17,660
relief and able to finally in a great

992
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:20,239
lattice so that we could have nationwide

993
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:21,980
networks for the first time so some of

994
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:24,230
the costs that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> artificial burdens</font>

995
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:26,329
were finally lifted I think I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could also</font>

996
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:27,980
stayed in this room that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of my</font>

997
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:30,259
peers would say that I'm in the top five

998
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:32,690
if not number one at capacity planning

999
00:56:30,259 --> 00:56:34,940
for pairing so some of the statements

1000
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:36,650
you made about capacity planning not

1001
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:39,470
happening or not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a consideration</font>

1002
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:41,779
or a concern may need to be revised okay

1003
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:46,759
that's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very 1990s view of the</font>

1004
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:47,869
telco um and if anybody wants to raise

1005
00:56:46,759 --> 00:56:50,150
their hand they'll say that we're

<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge on it thank you I just think</font>

1012
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:09,739
that you're putting the wrong emphasis

1013
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,210
on the telcos of the modern era we're

1014
00:57:09,739 --> 00:57:12,829
very bound by some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the limitations</font>

1015
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:15,739
and hardware that Keith Mitchell

1016
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:18,529
recognized where you go from here if

1017
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:20,089
you're already doing the limits of the

1018
00:57:18,529 --> 00:57:22,249
current technology in a single location

1019
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:23,900
with a single pier how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you scale that</font>

1020
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:25,910
and we're all very<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned and it's</font>

1021
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:28,130
not a terrorist<font color="#E5E5E5"> threat or some other</font>

1022
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:31,279
social issue that's applied this is very

1023
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:36,589
real and it's very hardware-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1024
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:39,640
my only concern is that the telephone

1025
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:42,549
company doesn't behave anti

1026
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:45,799
competitively when they improve their

1027
00:57:42,549 --> 00:57:51,710
technology that they don't put in stuff

1028
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:53,809
like ims which is designed it loses its

1029
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:57,970
value if you if discrimination is

1030
00:57:53,809 --> 00:58:01,609
illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> so to the extent that I know</font>

1031
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:04,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I mean network my hat is off to the</font>

you understand we run

all the data recovery models we use

1040

every tool possible telcos are not

1041
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:29,160
ignoring the network capacity needs

1042

uh-huh that is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case I'm</font>

1056
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:13,410
over and over is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that the term</font>

1057

network neutrality has become so

1058
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:18,410
politically and emotionally charged that

1059
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:21,720
it's become a<font color="#CCCCCC"> black-and-white issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ah</font>

1060
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:23,549
there is network neutrality in terms of

1061
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:26,520
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> si will call political neutrality</font>

1062
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:29,250
or commercial neutrality and favoring

1063
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:31,560
one service over another because they

1064
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,910
pay us to favor them or we like them or

1065
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,940
we have a lot of their stock or

1066
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:38,069
something there is network neutrality in

1067
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,810
terms of saying oh there's no quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1068
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:41,490
service allowed out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there everything</font>

1069
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:44,070
every packet goes through exactly the

1070
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:45,959
same we don't do any real engineering on

1071
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,780
this to make the network run better we

1072
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,820
just hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it runs well and throw</font>

1073
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,380
bandwidth at it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can solve a lot of</font>

1074
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:54,000
problems with more bandwidth you can

1075
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:56,640
also solve a lot of problems with good

1076
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,160
engineering but as moment the moment the

1077
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:01,730
network neutrality issue raised is

1078
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:05,310
raised people are instantly polarized

1079
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:06,780
there's the oh dear if we have network

1080
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:09,060
neutrality the network will break and

1081
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:10,619
there is the odor if we have network if

1082
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:13,529
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have network neutrality the</font>

1083
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">network will break those are views that</font>

1084
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:16,680
don't lend themselves to compromise and

1085
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,290
frankly don't lend themselves to

1086
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:21,089
understanding so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure what the</font>

1087
01:00:19,290 --> 01:00:23,910
solution is but we've got to realize

1088
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:25,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's network neutrality and then</font>

1089
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:30,990
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> network neutrality and they</font>

1090
01:00:25,950 --> 01:00:38,180
really aren't the same thing well put

1091
01:00:30,990 --> 01:00:43,040
well put the the discrepancy between

1092
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:47,899
anti-competitive discrimination and

1093
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:51,390
network management is a real one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1094
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:54,030
all the proposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> network neutrality laws</font>

1095
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:57,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen may they make an</font>

1096
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:59,970
exception for network management I think

1097
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:02,009
that's a slippery slope especially

1098
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:09,810
considered that the telephone companies

1099
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:15,570
have over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the years historically said</font>

1100
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:17,759
you know a plastic mouthpiece that you

1101
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:20,820
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the telephone damages their</font>

1102
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,950
network and so on i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that network</font>

1103
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:27,750
management exceptions are slippery slope

1104
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:32,310
I have another proposal and that is to

1105
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:36,090
make it illegal for people who offer

1106
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:38,250
internet connections to have any

1107
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:40,020
financial interest whatsoever within

1108
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:42,840
what's carried over their connections

1109
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:44,880
then we're assured that whatever they do

1110
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:46,980
is for network management for network

1111
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,780
optimization and I wouldn't have a

1112
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:50,640
problem with<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1113
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,190
business of running a network run the

1114
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:56,250
network and have at it and the only

1115
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:57,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">restriction is you can't have the</font>

1116
01:01:56,250 --> 01:02:02,520
financial interest in what it what

1117
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:06,930
you're carrying so that that would solve

1118
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:09,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem in my humble opinion I'm</font>

you all a clue in your arguments you

said you were going to talk about

economics and there was a word on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

principle and the globally connected

internet not just talking about America

1133

and US politics and whatever but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had</font>

01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:55,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">the word commons at layer 3 and it is</font>

1135
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:58,140
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a commons it's a common pool there's</font>

1136
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:01,170
a huge difference a common pool is a

1137
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:03,990
bounded resource that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to</font>

1138
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:06,569
control access and and ingress from

1139
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:09,689
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody has to pay the</font>

01:03:06,569 --> 01:03:13,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">cost of innovation of capacity building</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff and somewhere in there there has</font>

to be economics that<font color="#E5E5E5"> supports</font>

1144
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:23,910
incremental payments subsidies which is

1145
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,520
why internet too had unbounded bandwidth

1146
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:28,710
with subsidies or something that looks

1147
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:30,690
like base level payments net neutrality

1148
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:32,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">is less of an issue in Europe where</font>

1149
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:35,099
there's already guaranteed based level

1150
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:37,589
payments for a level of service so I

1151
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:39,210
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to rescale this argument</font>

1152
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:40,859
to begin to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font>

1153
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:43,319
economics of what everybody here does

1154
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:45,779
and how they stay in business<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1155
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:50,339
there's no internet without that amen in

1156
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:54,000
fact I looked at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> word and I thought</font>

1157
01:03:50,339 --> 01:03:57,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a better word was public good</font>

1158
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:05,460
rather than Commons well how would that

1159
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:09,480
strike you common pool<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let's um can</font>

1160
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:13,650
we can can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we correspond on that thanks</font>

1161
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:16,260
I'd really like to follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> up good Randy</font>

and Wren it really excites me to learn

01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the peering policies and the</font>

bandwidth decision that the peering

radical<font color="#CCCCCC"> change that I'm sure</font>

all of us appreciate and you'll excuse

1173
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:51,029
me but I have to object because i am

01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:54,450
wearing sandals but but of course there

1177
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:03,030
cheering part of it is in my memory from

1178
01:05:00,990 --> 01:05:06,680
back in the dinosaur days being one of

1179

them myself is is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> most of that</font>

01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:12,450
competitive business efforting peering

<font color="#E5E5E5">and screwing one's neighbors is directed</font>

01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:18,689
towards other telcos at least wearing

1183
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:21,630
polka dot van's not sandals but I hear

1184
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:24,030
you Randy and we have learned that if

1185
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:26,670
you're selling dsl<font color="#CCCCCC"> or other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> services to</font>

1186
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:29,130
consumers where you have 12 million or

1187
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:31,230
more you need to keep your peering pipes

1188
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:34,410
uncongested because when the dsl

1189
01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:37,020
subscribers discover congestion you

1190
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:38,970
can't replace the capacity fast enough

1191
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:41,040
to remove it before it hits<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of the</font>

1192
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:45,560
news and none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us want that we make</font>

1193
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,560
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money by keeping it uncongested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1194
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:53,850
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah go ahead a number of</font>

1195
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:56,510
years ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get capacity</font>

1196
01:05:53,850 --> 01:06:01,730
from Marina del Rey to Santa Monica era

1197
01:05:56,510 --> 01:06:05,670
well I'm won't proof from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Los Gatos and</font>

1198
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:09,750
I was blown away to find out that during

1199
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:13,350
the 84 Olympics the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> company had</font>

1200
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:16,320
put in fiber in the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I wanted</font>

1201
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:20,730
capacity but they pulled it out after

1202
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:24,330
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Olympics and I just let my copper</font>

1203
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:27,210
that I I don't know what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did but</font>

1204
01:06:24,330 --> 01:06:29,910
they pulled out a perfectly valuable

1205
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:34,020
bandwidth to so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it wouldn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1206
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:36,120
available and the other point that I'd

1207
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:40,020
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make is that we're trying to set</font>

1208
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:43,080
up a metro area network and we can't get

1209
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:47,009
dark fiber even though the phone company

1210
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:49,890
has it they will only sell us bandwidth

1211
01:06:47,010 --> 01:06:50,130
by the bit instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a dark fiber and</font>

1212
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:53,879
that

1213
01:06:50,130 --> 01:06:57,059
an anti-competitive approach from the

1214
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:59,730
phone companies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion in a I</font>

1215
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:02,490
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they should be providing dark</font>

1216
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:06,240
fiber with amplifiers on the dark fiber

1217
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:10,680
so that we can go long distances instead

1218
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:13,008
of just short reach if they gave us dark

1219
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:15,808
fiber across the country we could

1220
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:20,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">replace the entire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long-distance phone</font>

1221
01:07:15,809 --> 01:07:25,349
company with a few fibers and so it's

1222
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:27,299
against their interest to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that but</font>

1223
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:33,180
they're standing in the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of progress</font>

1224
01:07:27,299 --> 01:07:38,640
in my opinion Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You Joel yay glee</font>

1225
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:42,089
currently with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nokia so I've been quite</font>

1226
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:44,670
quaint paying local access monopolies as

1227
01:07:42,089 --> 01:07:47,308
a consumer for something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in North</font>

1228
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:50,579
America we quaintly call broadband for

1229
01:07:47,309 --> 01:07:52,650
about eight years now and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1230
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:54,420
they've probably recovered the capital

1231
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:56,430
expenditure of building that resource to

1232
01:07:54,420 --> 01:08:00,000
my house at a hundred bucks a month over

1233
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:03,299
eight years or so but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know my</font>

1234
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,309
observation<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be that at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them very</font>

1235
01:08:03,299 --> 01:08:08,009
shortly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am going to have more</font>

1236
01:08:05,309 --> 01:08:10,410
bandwidth to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phone provisioned</font>

1237
01:08:08,009 --> 01:08:13,500
over a scarce resource that I telco paid

1238
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:16,889
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money for then I get from the</font>

1239
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:19,738
local access monopoly via dsl right and

1240
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:24,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">how is that that seems like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a rather</font>

1241
01:08:19,738 --> 01:08:28,379
interesting you know phenomenon right I

1242
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:36,330
think the local access monopoly on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1243
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:40,130
wire side has obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> not expended you</font>

1244
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:42,269
know the capital necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build</font>

1245
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:47,029
resources that are actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful for</font>

1246
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:47,029
us and I mean I find it very odd that

1247
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:52,920
they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more capacity than the</font>

1248
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:58,049
wireless vendors to seem to be building
