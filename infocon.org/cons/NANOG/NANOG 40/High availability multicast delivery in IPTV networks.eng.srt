1
00:00:00,589 --> 00:00:07,379
good morning thank you so what we'll

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,050
talk about here to begin with<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just</font>

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,040
looking at some options in the multicast

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:16,920
Network so the title for IPTV kind of

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,650
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could almost be any kind of</font>

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,859
multicast right so the agenda that we

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:25,019
will look into is first first of all to

8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:29,160
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the IPTV component and then</font>

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:31,650
we'll go into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look of the last mile</font>

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,180
kind of the access network and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

11
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,280
from the edge to the core network for

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the multicast enable and at the end of</font>

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,719
the presentation i'll try to go into

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,410
some discussion some slides around how

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,329
to achieve 50 millisecond<font color="#CCCCCC"> convergence 4p</font>

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,410
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> april multicast networks and we'll</font>

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:48,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk a little bit about that and i'll</font>

18
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:54,569
show you some of the of the chest and

19
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:56,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">incrementation that is done so in the</font>

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,829
IPTV<font color="#E5E5E5"> beast there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of different</font>

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:03,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">equipment so as we all know encoders and</font>

22
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,640
servos set-top boxes and a lot of other

23
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,010
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside that particular one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,799
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the overall picture of</font>

25
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,500
IPTV I'm basically going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at IPTV</font>

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,990
delivery from a network perspective so

27
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:19,500
basically going into first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

28
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:21,509
IPS is the axis node and then what I

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,540
choose here on this particular slide to

30
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,280
call the excitation note as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:33,960
that's kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the area of the</font>

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:36,030
network that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to focus on so if</font>

33
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,639
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look first kind of set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

34
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,659
scene I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about what is done</font>

35
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,420
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the SL forum with the TR 101 view of</font>

36
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,689
the world in broadband networks and how

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:52,399
they suggest to do multicast delivery in

38
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:55,710
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> access network so that's basically</font>

39
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:59,490
what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> defined by the axis node as and</font>

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,679
the IPS OS in CL 101 way it's called the

41
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,320
PNG the broadband network gateway right

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,360
so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a quick peek at</font>

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,669
that and just show what different

44
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,669
options is is listed in CL 101

45
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:17,670
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> tijuana one specifies two different</font>

46
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:21,120
models<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the for the access network it</font>

47
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifies a multi yet network where</font>

48
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,939
there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a an iph sauna pngs at all</font>

49
00:02:24,689 --> 00:02:30,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to call right that will service all the</font>

50
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:32,310
internet unicast data traffic so

51
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:35,730
typically like pvp sessions coming in

52
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,609
and being terminated on the on the IPS

53
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,200
and multicast delivery down to the sets

54
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:43,680
of boxes in an IPTV network will

55
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,349
typically go over a second multicast

56
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,519
enable router so like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual lips set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

57
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's one scenario that the ti 101</font>

58
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,220
is listing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> also lists another</font>

59
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:00,269
scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's called like a single it</font>

60
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:02,040
and the functionality of the network is

61
00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,930
exactly the same right it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just matter</font>

62
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,060
whether two boxes of one box or whatever

63
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,549
hand looks the same services so in the

64
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,620
single it's basically internet data

65
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,349
traffic the unicast PP termination<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh an</font>

66
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,109
IP session termination will be

67
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,690
terminated on the IPS that is also

68
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:21,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">servicing the multicast delivery</font>

69
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,220
downstream basically right so that's in

70
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,889
essence like the the difference between

71
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:28,620
a multi SN and a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> its topology in</font>

72
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:32,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">TR 101 it's basically do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> split out</font>

73
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,409
services in a box by box case or do you

74
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,859
consolidate the services into a single

75
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:44,430
box so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a little bit closer</font>

76
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:46,079
look at the different components so here

77
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I call it the broadband network a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

78
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:55,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to be a little consistent with the</font>

79
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:57,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">Tia 101 naming so I called the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iph on</font>

80
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:59,220
the slide and broadband network gateway

81
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,639
on the title so just to confuse myself

82
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:05,639
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the IPS there is</font>

83
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:08,430
responsible<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a multicast the delivery</font>

84
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,819
here right in CA 11 the IPS is

85
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,400
responsible for delivering the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multicast</font>

86
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,738
replication on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a per access node basis</font>

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,478
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not responsible for</font>

88
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:20,399
per subscriber or per household

89
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,520
multicast replication right it's only

90
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,919
responsible for app / access no

91
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,359
replication

92
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,470
and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new functionalities in in</font>

93
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,330
the multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> an area that was</font>

94
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">introduced in Tijuana one was basically</font>

95
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:37,969
this notion of having an interface where

96
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,250
you receive igmp joints on but you do

97
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">not service the multicast delivery out</font>

98
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,960
of that particular interface so that's

99
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,260
kind of the the new introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

100
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:53,239
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any value in tier 11 that</font>

101
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:56,060
it's a little bit I won't say surprising

102
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">but the idea here is that the if it's a</font>

103
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,980
duelist or if it's a single if the igmp

104
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,739
joints could come over the subscribers

105
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">PvP session but we don't want to</font>

106
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,790
encapsulate the multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> stream going</font>

107
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,980
downstream into pvp wanted to being able

108
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,750
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with that of an IPO</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> e so that</font>

109
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,200
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like a multicast service</font>

110
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,880
VLAN and then individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> PvP session per</font>

111
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,530
household so individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> VLANs per</font>

112
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,630
household so that's more or less like

113
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,539
what the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> its is repond is this</font>

114
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:26,390
responsible for right if you take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font>

115
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the at the access node so the axis</font>

116
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:31,250
node becomes responsible for the /

117
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,930
residential gateway multicast

118
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,820
replication of per household replication

119
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:36,890
right so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of a you</font>

120
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,840
can say multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> states multicast right</font>

121
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,900
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like naturally multicast</font>

122
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,880
networks right it fans out more and<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

123
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:45,950
the further down you go and which

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,830
basically gives you a great bandwidth

125
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:51,229
utilization in the network right so the

126
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:53,150
access node real service every single

127
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:55,010
household if a household comes in and

128
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:57,859
joins a channel that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> already present</font>

129
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,390
at the access node it won't be delivered

130
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that access</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nose once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wait and then</font>

131
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were basically find it out into</font>

132
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:07,369
multiple dsl ports or whatever part it

133
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:12,099
is and that particular axis node so Tia

134
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:16,250
101 also specifies multiple snooping

135
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:17,660
requirements for the axis node it has

136
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that he calls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transparence</font>

137
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,410
nupeng which basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any</font>

138
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,060
igmp<font color="#CCCCCC"> joins</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they come from the</font>

139
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,150
residential gateway or to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the axis node</font>

140
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,680
should pass uncharted through the access

141
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:30,530
node and also sought to get up to the

142
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">IPS so if people wanted to they could</font>

143
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:36,200
have a full subscribe of you a full

144
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,650
household view of multicast delivery up

145
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:41,229
on the IPS even though he<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't do</font>

146
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:43,690
the actual multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> application</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on per</font>

147
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:45,550
household right so that that's one thing

148
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,889
it's also very beneficial in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense</font>

149
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,600
but if you want to do some rate

150
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:52,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">adjustments to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the household for the</font>

151
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,889
unicast traffic based on what multicast

152
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,660
traffic is being delivered<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the axis</font>

153
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,270
node that that can also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> accomplished</font>

154
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,610
with that transition Spanish nupeng

155
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:04,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's only one of the snooping models</font>

156
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:07,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> CI 101 of suggesting right it also</font>

157
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:10,900
has what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he called snooping will report</font>

158
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,449
suppression so bits is almost the same

159
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,698
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not if it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not exactly the</font>

160
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:17,410
same as<font color="#CCCCCC"> igmp proxy right at least in my</font>

161
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:20,740
terminology it kind of the same because

162
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:22,210
what you do is you get in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my GM p join</font>

163
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the axis node and you only followed</font>

164
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,260
up to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP its if there is a need to</font>

165
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:30,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">do so if you already have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stream you</font>

166
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:33,610
don't forward it so and in the snooping

167
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,380
build rapport suppression they also say

168
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,330
that you allow to as an access node<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

169
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">route to rewrite that igmp packet if you</font>

170
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:41,169
want to you don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow the</font>

171
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,750
original ones though<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me did very much</font>

172
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:45,750
smells exactly like like a proxy model

173
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,620
real quick question yeah if you don't

174
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,869
forward it after if the group is already

175
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,849
joined you know forward to the join up

176
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:57,159
to the IP edge the state's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

177
00:07:54,849 --> 00:08:01,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">timeout so do you make it incremental</font>

178
00:07:57,159 --> 00:08:03,070
state in the IP edge so so you so if you

179
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't forward it up so basically what</font>

180
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:09,280
what in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the I GMP will report</font>

181
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:11,080
suppression are the other proxy the

182
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,609
access node is responsible for students

183
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,729
is joined once to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that it</font>

184
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,349
doesn't state a timeout but he won't

185
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:22,419
fall out new joints basically and then

186
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:24,880
basically the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next step that is defining</font>

187
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:27,639
in CA 101 is the residential gateway

188
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,960
right so the household<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the resident</font>

189
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gabriel basically in this particular</font>

190
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,870
setup is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brain of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the home so he</font>

191
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:36,968
becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the igmp proxy for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the home so</font>

192
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,459
if there's multiple sets of boxes behind

193
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,659
the residential gateway they will all be

194
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:42,429
serviced from that particular

195
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:45,130
residential gateway so resident gateway

196
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,229
only join the stream once and if two

197
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,700
sets of boxes watch the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel it</font>

198
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,270
would be replicated from the residential

199
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:54,910
gateway so basically it gives you IPS

200
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,250
replicate / access node access nope we

201
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,620
replicate<font color="#E5E5E5"> presidential gateway and then</font>

202
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:01,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">residenza gate gateway will replicate /</font>

203
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:04,740
sets a box inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> the household</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright</font>

204
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:09,100
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's kind of the the setup of the</font>

205
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:12,220
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TI 101 multicast delivery one</font>

206
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:14,830
other interesting piece that was

207
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,660
introduced in tier 11 is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that igmp joins</font>

208
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,970
should be able to be serviced<font color="#CCCCCC"> with an IP</font>

209
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:21,699
address<font color="#CCCCCC"> of sero sero sero sero so</font>

210
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,980
basically the residential gateway do not

211
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,810
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have an IP address allocated for</font>

212
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,540
to add to join the different multicast

213
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,369
screams and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> it this can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done</font>

214
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:32,319
since the access node is directly

215
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,320
connected<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the residential gateway</font>

216
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,940
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so don't need a an IP address i</font>

217
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,500
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically look at what part is</font>

218
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,500
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular joint coming in from and</font>

219
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,570
if the packet is forwarded up from the

220
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,870
yesterday from the axis node to the IPS

221
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:47,920
the iph then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at mac</font>

222
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,300
address or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that if you</font>

223
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,349
want to differentiate and find out what

224
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,359
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> household is this particular</font>

225
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming from right but that's another</font>

226
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:58,060
part that was introduced there so let's

227
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">just take a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look a quick look here at</font>

228
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,069
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> different options so one options</font>

229
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:05,290
that is defined there is in the sense

230
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,320
where you have the the wrongs that the

231
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:11,050
top line as a pupae recession<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is</font>

232
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,750
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> being set up getting an IP</font>

233
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:15,219
address VIP<font color="#E5E5E5"> TP so now the residential</font>

234
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,200
gateway have an IP address associated

235
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:19,840
with the pupae session which will

236
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,410
service all unicast and typically

237
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:25,450
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> best-effort kind of traffic but</font>

238
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same time there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an IPA</font>

239
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,020
encapsulation interface as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

240
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,120
an IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the residential gateway</font>

241
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:32,350
and the only thing that is used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

242
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,430
basically receiving the multicast

243
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,330
traffic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being streamed</font>

244
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:38,530
downstream from the access node so so

245
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,030
basically means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in this particular</font>

246
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:46,060
setup people can go out and introduce an

247
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:47,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">IPTV network without changing any models</font>

248
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,400
basically right they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can start</font>

249
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:54,400
delivering multicast over IP OE

250
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:58,150
encapsulated but without having an IP

251
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,699
dhcp network so to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the IP</font>

252
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses associated with the pp session</font>

253
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,210
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet traffic and there's no</font>

254
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,780
IP address associated<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the IP</font>

255
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,780
interface

256
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,470
sorry just back one step there and this

257
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular setup here is basically a the</font>

258
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">setup where the ascendancy gateway have</font>

259
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,099
to fork out the joints post on a PPC S&S

260
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,270
Willis on the IPO<font color="#CCCCCC"> e so basically what</font>

261
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,460
the rest instigate<font color="#CCCCCC"> weibull doing this</font>

262
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,460
scenario is a restrainer<font color="#CCCCCC"> join to any</font>

263
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,830
channel outpost on the pupae OE session

264
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,990
as well as on the iperion encapsulated

265
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">interface so the access node with snoop</font>

266
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:42,100
on the IP re but it won't snoop on the

267
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:44,230
pppoe traffic so option number two is

268
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,450
basically where<font color="#E5E5E5"> resident gate we only</font>

269
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,030
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the igmp join on the IP we</font>

270
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:52,630
encapsulate the interface again there's

271
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,040
a pupae session in in play here so the

272
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:56,260
resident resident gateway have an IP

273
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,240
address on the pupae session which means

274
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,620
that don't have to have one on the dhcp

275
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,690
as well because it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

276
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:05,020
we encapsulate interface for receiving

277
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,120
multicast traffic and communicating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:08,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">IGP joints upstream but since igmp</font>

279
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,230
joints in this particular setup is

280
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,670
allowed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be communicated</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with 000 you</font>

281
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,650
don't need an IP address again<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

282
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,140
right so again you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have a</font>

283
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:20,709
DHCP enable it network for this

284
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,840
particular thing to work so in this

285
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,550
particular thing traffic will always IDP

286
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,960
joints only go on the IP you eat the

287
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:28,469
axis node and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the access node will</font>

288
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,030
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the IPS are they in a</font>

289
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,870
transparent knowing as<font color="#CCCCCC"> a snooping kind</font>

290
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,910
of the reports of<font color="#CCCCCC"> christian mode and</font>

291
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,770
then finally if you have networks where

292
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's no PPE session for the internet</font>

293
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:43,120
traffic right then you have to have a

294
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:45,610
dhcp enabled network<font color="#CCCCCC"> on static IP</font>

295
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,470
addresses as some people also do but it

296
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,150
basically means that now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an IP</font>

297
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,500
address associated with the IPO<font color="#CCCCCC"> ink at</font>

298
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the interface and everything works like</font>

299
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,600
hunky-dory as we would expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font>

300
00:12:52,870 --> 00:13:01,180
no no surprises in that particular one

301
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,400
so that's more or less what is defined

302
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,890
and talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tia 101 when it</font>

303
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,290
comes to multicast delivery yeah did the

304
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:10,840
standard considered using am<font color="#CCCCCC"> amt and</font>

305
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:15,040
then just have the amt session run over

306
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,790
the PPO e session no it did not look at

307
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">that at all</font>

308
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,319
because the iph could be an amt relay

309
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:24,450
and you could just have all the

310
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,790
multicast packets at that point be

311
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,220
encapsulated in unicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sent over</font>

312
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,140
the existing infrastructure yeah yeah

313
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:32,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been another right it</font>

314
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:38,040
did not take that into consideration<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

315
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:40,439
all at all so if you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the at the</font>

316
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,300
next step up in the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> of car</font>

317
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,430
taking a quick look there from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipx</font>

318
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,199
and going up into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core so this has</font>

319
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,359
nothing to do with chia 101 to say right

320
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,490
so this space is the IP space right and

321
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,990
it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like defined in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iha</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

322
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:55,800
standard bodies right but nothing to do

323
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:58,530
with dsl form so basically in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

324
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,569
particular scenario there's many

325
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:03,780
different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go in a design right</font>

326
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:06,480
so what do you do in an IP TV network do

327
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:08,760
you go all IP and basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> peyman able</font>

328
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,080
your whole network or do you go to

329
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,670
transport for some part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font>

330
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,110
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multicast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at every right so</font>

331
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,670
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different different</font>

332
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,050
options to take into consideration i'm

333
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,660
not going to dive into all of the

334
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,209
options here so but basically just some

335
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:22,890
of the the obvious discussions is

336
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:26,250
typically in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core will you pay me</font>

337
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:28,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nabal that call or whether you do punch</font>

338
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,920
multi-point multicast delivery right so

339
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:33,480
that's typically the discussion and that

340
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the one I'm going to focus on in</font>

341
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,850
this particular next next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slides here</font>

342
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,370
right so basically from an EPS access if

343
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:43,290
you look at different IPS<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

344
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,960
designs right what we see out there is

345
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:48,270
typically ring topology a square

346
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,770
topology or kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of star topology and I</font>

347
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,600
know that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are different many</font>

348
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:53,939
flavors of these kind of technologies

349
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,510
right but it's just to give an idea that

350
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,030
no matter what is being done in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ndx</font>

351
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:04,460
it would be doable in the next couple of

352
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:07,920
slides to apply this<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi class fast</font>

353
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,290
recovery for all these typologies if you

354
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,579
wanted to wait so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

355
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:13,740
slides<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've focused</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the star topology</font>

356
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:16,020
and I have one slide at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as</font>

357
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">the square apology they have some</font>

358
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,750
challenging the ring topology mean get

359
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,280
into that later on if we kind of got

360
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,280
time otherwise we if anyone is too much

361
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:26,490
as we can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it off offline but but</font>

362
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,699
this is basically what it is so if you

363
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:31,709
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at these different access networks</font>

364
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,139
so if it's a carries net-based<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess a</font>

365
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:37,229
network they're definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> some some</font>

366
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:40,410
challenges to make multicast fast

367
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:42,209
recovery right because how do you detect

368
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:46,049
failure and how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font>

369
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:48,268
you forward traffic in a carrier

370
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:49,739
ethernet based I guess network typically

371
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:51,449
spanning through your rapid spanning

372
00:15:49,739 --> 00:15:53,309
tree kind of thing right but it's a

373
00:15:51,449 --> 00:15:58,019
shared one so you have the whole issue

374
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:59,730
with igmp destinator routers in and so

375
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,100
on who delivers the multicast and how do

376
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">they communicate which one so there's a</font>

377
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:08,540
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of challenges in that particular one</font>

378
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:11,160
that's challenging the mpls as well vpls

379
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:12,988
exactly the same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of challenges</font>

380
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,049
right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it is kind of a one</font>

381
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:17,459
broadcast domain in depth yes and so so

382
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:19,919
what I<font color="#CCCCCC"> will try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at is</font>

383
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,790
much more on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual pimp</font>

384
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:25,709
functionality of this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at</font>

385
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:28,199
ITP fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> convergence oh there's been a</font>

386
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:29,969
couple of very good presentations

387
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier in other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nanak meetings right</font>

388
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,859
that have focused on fast convergence

389
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,809
fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp protocols right and basically</font>

390
00:16:34,859 --> 00:16:40,649
all routers out there today have

391
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:42,569
implemented more or less functionalities

392
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:45,299
that will allow ITP to to do fast

393
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:47,368
convergence so basically means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i TP</font>

394
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,529
protocol is implementing an event-driven

395
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:51,179
model right so if something happens the

396
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:53,419
SPF calculation can take effect

397
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:56,039
immediately but if there's a lot of

398
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:58,169
turbulence in the network they kind of

399
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:04,019
bag off and go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a timer timer mode</font>

400
00:16:58,169 --> 00:17:05,939
and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so this also some browsers out</font>

401
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:09,599
there that have optimized pay me a

402
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:12,569
little bit so that in case of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pin will</font>

403
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,829
receive joins on a PF interfaces

404
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,209
typically like according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

405
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:17,490
standards you just drop it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

406
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:18,899
wait wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> four and four we transmit some</font>

407
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,299
routers have optimized that a little bit

408
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:22,708
so they keep the original pim join a

409
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:24,569
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit and see if there's an igp</font>

410
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:27,870
convergence that that is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress and</font>

411
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,830
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the IPF interface might change and</font>

412
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,739
you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to service that</font>

413
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:34,678
particular join that comes in so there's

414
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:37,769
different options there for two to even

415
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,720
speed up the convergence so if you take

416
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">a look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at this what PIM typically do</font>

417
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,290
right when it relies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a GP convergence</font>

418
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,480
right there's no surprising that

419
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:48,389
particular one I did the example

420
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,670
basically based on what I call static

421
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:53,100
pimp which basically means which

422
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,920
basically means that pull down the

423
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,870
multicast traffic to the IPS ahead of

424
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,640
time before you get an igmp join coming

425
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:03,989
in so it basically will say this is

426
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,700
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that is deployed in</font>

427
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,380
many networks right where they make sure

428
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:10,200
that the multicast stream is present on

429
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:12,660
the IPS ahead of time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then bring a</font>

430
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,190
household want to subscribe to one of

431
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">the channels it being serviced right out</font>

435
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,770
the multicast traffic is being pulled

436
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:29,700
down to the iph devices then when an

get the stream from that one and start

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,190
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be a blip in the</font>

of time for the ITP convergence

457
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,440
basically and the new pimp join and the

00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">again so no no big surprises here right</font>

460
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:24,139
with all the optimization that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is done</font>

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:26,550
in ite<font color="#CCCCCC"> IGP for for the different routers</font>

462
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,700
what we've seen in network is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

463
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:31,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">disconnected we optimized down to the</font>

464
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,080
hundreds of milliseconds so you can

465
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:36,530
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get pretty good convergence</font>

466
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,439
performance in multicast just by relying

467
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:45,660
surely on ITP convergence and normal

468
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:50,700
multicast the behavior but basically

469
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">driven from some big IPTV middle of a</font>

470
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,370
server requirements right this

00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:58,559

473
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">true guarantee that you do not get like</font>

475
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:10,950

476
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:13,139
work has been done here right and one of

477
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,670
them is mpls point-to-multipoint

478
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,820
delivery right one of the big advantages

479
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:20,040
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the multicast is that you can</font>

480
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:22,590
benefit immediately from mpls fast we're

481
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,300
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to a 50 millisecond</font>

483
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:33,480
of a failure right but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go</font>

484
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:35,400
all IP and all pimp basically this can

485
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,440
also be done right so basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we do</font>

486
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,179
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we call pinged will join</font>

487
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,520
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically just lesson learn</font>

488
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:44,220
from multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> high availability</font>

489
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,639
financial networks out there today where

490
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:49,190
the receiver<font color="#CCCCCC"> will pull down a multi-car</font>

491

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">the receivable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> decided self which one to</font>

493
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,250
use basic right so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just this</font>

494
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,460
particular scenario that is being taken

495
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:03,330
up into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPX and the iph which is the</font>

497
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:09,928
the multicast right he now on

498
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,550
behalf of the clients pull down the

499
00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:14,970

501
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,320
occurs further up in the network it can

502
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,449
become a local<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision for that IPS</font>

503
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:24,000
watch stream to service the axis node on

504
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:30,059
the household were so that's kind of the

505
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:33,630
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pim dual join so it also</font>

join<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to work in allston</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours right</font>

508
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,190
it can rely on on a local failure and

509
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,370
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a light out faded situation but</font>

510
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,540
a lot of networks have layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

511
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,949
transmission equipment in between so you

512
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,899
need some kind of protocol as a

513
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,400
keepalive protocol to make sure to

514
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,280
detect when<font color="#CCCCCC"> link failures of a node</font>

515
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,670
failures basic basically happens right

516
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:59,280
typically in pft the individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

517
00:21:56,670 --> 00:22:02,250
routing protocols will register as

518
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,230
clients to to BFD so what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

519
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,260
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be allowed him to register</font>

520
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,330
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> PFD so basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll get PFD</font>

521
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,110
notification if there is a link failure

522
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,480
if there's a

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:15,209
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of failure should the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PFD</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> keep</font>

525
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:21,030
its own without waiting<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the ITP</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">convergence and the RIP base which you</font>

527
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:25,110
were to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> router convergence so if you</font>

528
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:28,230
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at this and how it will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

529
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:31,979
with the dual joint so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> now in</font>

530
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,720
this star topology here IPS number two

531
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,490
will send<font color="#E5E5E5"> out two joints one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in each</font>

532
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,559

533
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:42,030
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different s aggregation</font>

534
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:43,620
routers and you basically fill up all

535
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:46,710
the links that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in that particular</font>

536
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">Network then with the multicast so every</font>

537
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:52,290
single I PFC will receive the stream

538
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:55,320
twice once from each node on the

539
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:58,168
aggregation one when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dimpy join comes</font>

540
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,570
in from the access node the IPS can then

541
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:03,410
decide which one of these logical

542
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,000
streams and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm receiving is my primary</font>

543
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:10,320
multicast cream and it starts basically

544
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:14,640
join and at the that particular access

545
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:17,668
node to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ofs for the primary particle</font>

546
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,370
stream there now in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a failure of</font>

547
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:23,340
a link failure it basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes a</font>

548
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:26,428
local decision for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPX to switch the</font>

549
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:27,928

550
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:29,309
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stream receive from its i</font>

551
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:31,140
guess and router number two right so

552
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:33,870
basically switching the whole oif list

553
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:37,880
from a primary a PF interface down to a

554
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,879
secondary a PF interface

555
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:46,240
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take that thinking and kind of</font>

556
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,030
do a quick comparison with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mps</font>

557
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,670
point-to-multipoint and see what is the

558
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:53,559
pros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what the cons of pim dual join</font>

559
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:57,130
compared to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> mpls point-to-multipoint</font>

560
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,620
delivery so pimp has<font color="#CCCCCC"> dynamic leaf</font>

561
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:01,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition removal right so in the access</font>

562
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,090
network if you don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull it</font>

563
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,590
down all the streams to the IPS which

564
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,178
you probably don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want as soon as the</font>

565
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,500
IPTV netbooks kind of grows and you have

566
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,880
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of channels their high definition</font>

567
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,710
stand the challenge of standard

568
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,380
definition channels right you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

569
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:15,490
it fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the band with all the time so</font>

570
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:17,530
you might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into a dynamic</font>

571
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:19,000
behavior where when a household one and

572
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:20,649

573
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,970
you pull it down to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IPS and only</font>

574
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,500
have maybe the most popular channels

575
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,990
being delivered to the IPS all the time

576
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:27,700
right so that's famous is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this a great</font>

577
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,530
addition for that because it's allow you

578
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:31,900
to do the dynamic leaf addition and

579
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:34,299
removal which points multi-point at this

580

time<font color="#CCCCCC"> MPs don't allow you to do right</font>

581
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:39,580
it's the static nail up through<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

582
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:41,918
point to<font color="#E5E5E5"> multipoint LSP pim don't have a</font>

584
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,630
have right so the in access network this

585
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">is probably not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important part</font>

586
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:51,970
because very seldom would<font color="#E5E5E5"> I expect</font>

587
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,390
people indeed last jump of the access

588
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:56,890
network to actually make any any traffic

589
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:58,360
engineering for the multicast delivery

590
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,280
but that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that pin won't</font>

591
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,469
won't be able to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

593

millisecond fast<font color="#CCCCCC"> without capabilities</font>

595
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:11,678
right because both of them are basically

596
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:14,530
local decisions so if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a quick</font>

597
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,200
look here at this particular slide here

598
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:18,399
so if you now look instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a star</font>

599
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,640
topology which they<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through before</font>

600
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,400
I look at a square topology where like I

601
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,510
ph's would be connected together so if

602
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,480
you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this and you want to do</font>

603
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:30,879
point to<font color="#CCCCCC"> multipoint 8sp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protection you</font>

604
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,549
have to set up a bad lot of backup LSPs

605
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,250
as well to be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> protect this rare</font>

606
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:38,320
in the pim dual joint all you have to do

607
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,970
is on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipx is basically configure</font>

608
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,580
that this is a dual joint and you have

609
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,950
to send out joins in two directions

610
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:47,649
instead of only on the IPF interface

611
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,960
right so the provisioning of this is is

612
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:53,309
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to give you 50 milliseconds</font>

613
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,000
protection than it is for the MPLS and

614
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:57,910
another thing is

615
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:01,750
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls in someone falls into the</font>

616
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:04,720
situation you actually can<font color="#CCCCCC"> fill up your</font>

617
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:07,150
links in failure situation will double

618
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,550
the amount of traffic so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> rear out</font>

619
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:11,080
some of the LSP so already existing LSB

620
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,060
right you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to have to LSPs</font>

621
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,860
can you say multicast traffic in a

622
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,419
failure situation on the link which you

623
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,310
will never have in the PM<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> join you</font>

624
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">will always only have the same amount of</font>

625
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:26,860
traffic on the links whether it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

626
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">failure are an unfair situation and then</font>

627
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,510
just that at the last slide here just

628
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,790
want to show a little some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tests</font>

629
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:36,490
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been done in a network so</font>

630
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:38,440
basically this network that we did the

631
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,780
testing one was to being designed in a

632
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:42,850
star topology so an iph had connectivity

633
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:46,899
up to two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> excitation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> routers</font>

634
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:48,669
and they pulled down in his in this test

635
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:51,370
pulled down the multicast traffic to the

636
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:53,590
iph the head of time so before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I any</font>

637
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">item p joined came in the multicast</font>

638
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:59,620
traffic was already present at the IPS

639
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:03,160
so and then we're running PFD between

640
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:06,370
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iph then I gation router one and two</font>

641
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically we're there multiply of three</font>

642
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:12,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit and receive interval of ten</font>

643
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:15,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">millisecond so basically for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PFD to rule</font>

644
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,560
to see a link failure on node failure

645
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:19,150
that will take you a little bit more

646
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">than 30 milliseconds right there to</font>

647
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">retake the failure so what we basically</font>

648
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:27,190
saw there was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the AI biet sends the</font>

650
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:32,620
and the secondary has come a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DPM join</font>

651
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:35,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">two at gaze into and then we introduce</font>

652
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:40,929
the link failure as realist and node

653
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:42,550

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,220
recall a<font color="#CCCCCC"> paste and light out which means</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">no BFD kind of thing right the recovery</font>

658
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,690

659
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,950
milliseconds if you rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the PFD to</font>

660
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,370
tell you when the link is down instead

of light out kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you add those</font>

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:03,159
30-something milliseconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and it</font>

663
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:05,140
takes a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 48</font>

664
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">millisecond was pretty consistent below</font>

there

667
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,830
and it basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> those numbers replicate</font>

of washington in your conversation on TR

685
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:19,240
101 it sounded like the ANS only build a

686
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,580
multicast table for all of their down

687
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,049
streams is there any way to resolve if

688
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:26,290
you have an a n that's supporting

689
00:29:23,049 --> 00:29:28,950
multiple IP edges upstream IE where you

690
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:32,200
have a competitive am that has the lex

691
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:35,350
local IP edge and potentially others and

692
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:40,480
how it would resolve separate multicast

693
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:43,120
tables for each inside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

694
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,020
inside the access node<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so in the</font>

695
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,909
access node has the physical

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,070
connectivity from the dsl<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-users</font>

697
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:50,500
right and concentrates it up to the IP

698
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:52,389
edge right it is what happens if there

699
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:56,049
are multiple IP edges for that access

700
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:57,790
node education notes are we had

701

different IPS is<font color="#CCCCCC"> as servicing different</font>

702
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:03,280
multicasts ports basically so<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes right</font>

703
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,049
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just have one view that it then</font>

704
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,610
consolidates down for all of the

705
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:09,960

00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,950
it actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so the standard talks</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">kinda thing right but yeah the</font>

00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sentence</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or if it could divide it</font>

715
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:29,199
up into different partitions so that

716
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:30,669
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the standards that talk</font>

717
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,499
about different petitions in an axis

718
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:34,330
node but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do not specify specifically</font>

719
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:36,519
relate should have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-cat</font>

720
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:37,960
for you in each of these petitions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

721
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:39,610
potentially where there's a competitive

722
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,440
situation there you might want that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

723
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,719
an isolation issue that you have there

724
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,940
yeah say you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a corporate downstream</font>

725
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,159
customer on an a n and you are there

726
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:49,899
potentially reusing IP multicast groups

727
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,840
that you have upstream on your IP edge

728
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:55,678
for like the local<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider yeah true</font>

729
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,678
yeah so okay
