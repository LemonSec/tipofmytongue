00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your introduction so my</font>

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,670
have done with a tool called<font color="#E5E5E5"> CB GP and</font>

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,910
we applied<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to to model some aspects</font>

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,160
of routing in a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> be and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,660
joint work with the Sebastian told STV

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">leak and what if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you so</font>

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:38,660
short agenda first motivate the work

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:43,739
then give a brief overview<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

12
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:48,019
simulators feature and show how we we

13
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:54,209
apply it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jo which is the European</font>

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:59,090
research and education network so why

15
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:03,899
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mud on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

16
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:08,700
with another tool then current capacity

17
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:14,040
planning tool well it's a lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

18
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:18,000
nth element traffic and bgp so it's

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,420
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to predict the impact of a</font>

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,220
link failure or change in your routing

21
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:29,640
policies or the addition or removal of

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other peering link on your inter</font>

23
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">domain traffic another question is how</font>

24
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,060
can i adjust all the parameters of my

25
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:45,149
network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP policies and so on in</font>

26
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,729
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce my costs in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order to</font>

27
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:49,970
increase my performance or in order to

28
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,530
increase the reliability of my network

29
00:01:49,970 --> 00:02:00,299
so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the question we are trying</font>

30
00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:03,060
to to answer so in my understanding this

31
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:06,360
is the view that traditional capacity

32
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:11,300
planning to have of a nice p network so

33
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:14,480
it's pretty like an isolated island

34
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:20,270
not really taking into account what

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:23,510
happens outside of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network but the</font>

36
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,890
reality it's much more complex so you

37
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:32,299
have transit traffic multiple de gracias

38
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:35,149
maybe a complex ibgp structure in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

39
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:39,260
network including route reflectors even

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:42,860
multiple levels of<font color="#CCCCCC"> road reflectors there</font>

41
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,560
are a lot of destination so around<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

42
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:49,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred and fifteen thousand different</font>

43
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,770
prefixes in BGP routing tables and you

44
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:57,760
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the interaction between an igp</font>

45
00:02:51,770 --> 00:03:01,160
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice ice or SPF and and bgp so</font>

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:05,560
understanding what is going on in a nice

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:11,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">p network seems to be pretty hard and</font>

48
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:14,770
certainly too much for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> human brain so</font>

49
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:18,650
we have developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tool called see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

50
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:21,050
that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to compute the routes that</font>

51
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">bgp would have selected in an in a</font>

52
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:29,920
network based on knowledge of the

53
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:34,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">topology and wrote router configurations</font>

54
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,440
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp supports most of the bgp</font>

55
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:42,410
estrogen process over a local per FAS

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:44,810
path length mad another thing it can be

57
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,489
configured with a different routing

58
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:53,170

59
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:57,440
prepending aes pass etc it is able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

it's free it's an open source tool

69
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:30,719
follows so first we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> capture some</font>

70
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,560
data onto into the network to build a

view of the topology we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:45,690
the route maps etc and with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

74
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:48,810
build the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sea bgp model with one view of</font>

75
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,930
the model we can compute the what we

76
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:54,900
call the routing state that is all the

77
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,440
route towards all the prefixes in each

78
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:00,870
router in the model then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> play</font>

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the model we can change the state</font>

82
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:17,099
or remove routes and see what other

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,138
routing<font color="#E5E5E5"> states we can obtain after the</font>

84
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:23,099
changes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can compare all</font>

these routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> states in order to to to</font>

86
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:29,330
figure what's going on in addition with

87
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:32,549
we are also able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> wait these routes</font>

88
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:38,639
with traffic collected with net flow for

89
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:41,070
instance this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sample of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

90
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,949
output you could get from CBGB so it's

91
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:49,110
based on model of the abilene network

92
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:50,550
and command shown here just display the

93
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,979
different steps of the decision process

94
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:58,400
on a single router towards a single

95
00:05:52,979 --> 00:06:04,830
destination prefix so let's go to the

96
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:11,099
case today so Jo is a network with pops

97
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:14,849
in all the European<font color="#E5E5E5"> capitals so there</font>

98
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:18,750
are around I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fred 23 notes I got</font>

99
00:06:14,849 --> 00:06:23,070
more information here<font color="#E5E5E5"> 38 cowlings and 53</font>

100
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:28,560
peering<font color="#CCCCCC"> lengths and among these bearings</font>

101
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:30,539
links six are with upstream providers so

102
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,469
we have obtained the the general

103
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:35,789
topology based on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> ice ice trays we</font>

104
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:40,700
are we obtained BG

105
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:45,230
routing data from a zebra collector

106
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:47,960
connected with ibgp sessions to all the

107
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:54,390
routers in jail so we collected all the

108
00:06:47,960 --> 00:07:03,000
the current best ebgp routes and in

109
00:06:54,390 --> 00:07:05,789
addition we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also get NetFlow data so at</font>

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,390
first scenario i'm going to show you as

111
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:11,970
a scenario where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> in vegas</font>

112
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:15,510
investigated the addition and removal<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

113
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:20,130
peering<font color="#E5E5E5"> lengths so on the example shown</font>

114
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:23,099
on the slide we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

115
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:27,300
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen to work traffic if you if we</font>

116
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:31,110
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> peering with a new neighbor z and</font>

117
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:33,330
let's see how the traffic will be spread

118
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:41,130
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and other appearing</font>

119
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:43,830
links so in the next slide I'll show two

120
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:49,409
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of experiments one where</font>

121
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:52,020
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have added a full BGP routing tables</font>

122
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:54,390
at different locations in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network in</font>

123
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,990
order to simulate the addition of a new

124
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:02,010
peering<font color="#E5E5E5"> and scenarios where we have</font>

125
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:05,460
removed the routes previously learned

126
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:07,320
from an existing peering and the metric

127
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:12,810
here is the distribution of the traffic

128
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:14,310
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different upstream the</font>

129
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:18,660
different links with the upstream

130
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:22,020
providers so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a simplified view</font>

131
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:26,730
of general on the top of a figure you

132
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:30,690
see the six appearing links that we will

133
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:35,010
consider with their a load of outgoing

134
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:40,220
traffic and we are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove PR</font>

135
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:45,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to PR</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four and then add new pairings</font>

136
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:48,709
on routers are 1 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 2 etc and that's</font>

137
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:52,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">the kind of output we can obtain</font>

138
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:54,599
so on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> x-axis you have the different</font>

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:59,430
scenarios<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first one is a default</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">state on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the y-axis you see the fraction</font>

141
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:07,888

00:09:07,889 --> 00:09:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">default case you can see that the</font>

144
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:21,329
traffic loads is already highly unevenly

145
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:24,589
distributed so PR to hear carries fifty

146
00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:29,508
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Geo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going traffic so now</font>

147
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:32,370
in the red scenarios where we remove

148
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:38,100
appearing link we can see Frank for

149
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:42,300
example the dell pr2 example here in

150
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,360
this case we remove the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> link with PR</font>

151
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:49,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">2 and we can see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that another appearing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">linksno</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> carries all the load previously</font>

154
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:59,910
something difficult to predict by hand

155
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:03,540
in the case of the addition of peering

156
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:07,230
we can see in the case of the addition

157
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,839
of appearing with our van that the the

158
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:14,010
new peering link will will take all the

159
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:18,510
traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> previously went out true</font>

160
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:23,779
pr2 and well so you can you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

161
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:27,860
four different different scenarios

162
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:30,529
second experiment we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have done is</font>

163
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:34,220
investigate what will happen when

164
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:40,470
internal links will sail and how the

165
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:43,980
traffic will be redistributed also how

166
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:50,430
many routing changes each link failure

167
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:52,759
can cause inside my network here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

168
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,739
classified each routing changing

169
00:10:52,759 --> 00:11:00,510
according to what's shown on the slide

170
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we have looked at routing changes</font>

171
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:06,240
that just change the reach

172
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:10,079
ability of destination so in this class

173
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,600
we will see prefixes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

174
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,560
reachable before the in failure and that

175
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:22,800
are not reachable anymore phn pure

176
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:25,859
change our roads that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

177
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,809
through another<font color="#CCCCCC"> AES egress changes still</font>

178
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,050
through the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> alias but true and</font>

179
00:11:27,809 --> 00:11:35,579
another egress router and then we only

180
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:37,410
have in infra domain routing changes so

181
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,469
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> summary here on the</font>

182
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:45,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">x-axis you have all the link failures</font>

183
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:48,800
and on the y-axis you have all the

184
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:54,629
routing changes and the colors indicate

185
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:56,969
the the class of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rotating change so</font>

186
00:11:54,629 --> 00:12:00,829
what we can observe here is that the

187
00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:03,689
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> link failure can cause more than</font>

188
00:12:00,829 --> 00:12:06,410
500,000 routing changes so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

189
00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:08,849
accumulated of our old Rovers in network

190
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:12,750
that's the first observation and a

191
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:18,029
second observation is that most routing

192
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:20,639
changes are changes at the internal

193
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:29,809
mental level so these are pH changes and

194
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:29,809
egress changes not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only changing between</font>

195
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:35,639
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that wouldn't be seen by a</font>

traditional<font color="#CCCCCC"> clappers capacity planning</font>

197
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:46,889
tools so as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion we have a tool</font>

198
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:50,579
that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> useful for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to try to</font>

199
00:12:46,889 --> 00:12:54,089

it to three different networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

203
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,628
<font color="#CCCCCC">to apply it to other networks so if you</font>

204
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:12,480
are interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the tool do not</font>

205
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:13,290
hesitate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> contact us and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would like</font>

206

to

207
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:20,920
to tell you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

208
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:24,849
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> changes that are caused and</font>

network are in tellement changes that's

210
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:38,260
why the modeling tools that that you use

00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:40,990
should take into account<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp routing we</font>

212
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,730
have some direction for further work try

00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to predict</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the impact on the inbound</font>

214

00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:57,580
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the on the internet apology we also</font>
