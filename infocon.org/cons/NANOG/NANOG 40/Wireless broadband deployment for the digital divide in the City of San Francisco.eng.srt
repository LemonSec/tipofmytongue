hi I'm Tim I'm with company called the

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,490
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> application side that I try to do the</font>

00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,690
vocation side is is United layer the

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,519
application site is trying to address

6
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,279
some digital divide issues and

7
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,948
particularly around San Francisco ran

8
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,198
into a bit of a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the city ran</font>

9
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,689
into a bit of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem mayor's office</font>

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">community development wanted to try to</font>

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,250
turn up broadband in a number of their

12
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,149
housing developments around San

13
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,079
Francisco for some<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange reason</font>

14
00:00:32,149 --> 00:00:35,670
broadband is not available in those

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,440
areas because the incumbents say gee we

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,530
can't get a return on the investment for

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,480
that space so they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:46,110

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,078
out there Comcast broadband into that

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,090
area things like that so about four

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,210
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> San Francisco is not lit with</font>

broadband you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> dial up that's about</font>

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:00,120
it so in this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of San</font>

24
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,940
Francisco if you look at the very right

Point where basically as most cities do

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,320
they try to coordinate you know

29
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,880
prostitution drug dealing not

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,830
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> all in one place but they</font>

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,399
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to corner into various places</font>

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case of low economic status you</font>

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,240
get sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> shoved into that corner over</font>

34
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:34,829
there so oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's supposed to be a</font>

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:39,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture there anyway quick time yes I</font>

36
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,220
did well anyway this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> picture right</font>

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">there if you just sort of imagine it in</font>

Avenue which is where my<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colo is and</font>

44
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,229
they came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> he said well how do</font>

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,939
we going to do this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said gee I bet</font>

46
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,140
I could put a 5.8 gigahertz link in

47
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:05,639
between those two sides before<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

48
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,759
actually I started jumped ahead a little

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,830
bit the city because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they were unable to</font>

50
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,269
get broadband in that area the only

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,350
option they had was putting in a couple

52
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,580
ds1 swell

53
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,829
why it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be six hundred fifty</font>

54
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,560
dollars per ds1 for thirteen hundred

55
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,900
dollars a month you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was able to</font>

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,610
get a quote for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Pac Bell ds1 with</font>

Nevadas for five hundred dollars a month

59
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,820
so I guess they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really trying to</font>

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,739
help out the SBC is not really trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

61
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:34,170
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the digital divide that much if</font>

62
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:36,600
they're trying to charge us for just one

63
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:38,160
mile<font color="#CCCCCC"> for six hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty dollars so</font>

64
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,840
they almost killed the project off they

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,220
just didn't have this MRC this is kind

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,910
of a pet project by the mayor's office

67
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:48,990
community development so getting back to

68
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:52,950
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was the solution 5.8 gigahertz</font>

69
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:55,890

70
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,679
rate 108 megabits so you can get upwards

71
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:59,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">of about 50 megabits over this stuff</font>

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,400
shooting over the rooftops wouldn't work

73
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:05,160
due to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fornells own Clarence everybody</font>

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,020
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Fornell zone clearances mmm</font>

75
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,700
some people over<font color="#E5E5E5"> there okay that means</font>

76
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there's a space around the</font>

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,399
microwave path that you have to clear in

78
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,470
other words as as the path goes out

79
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle it gets really fat</font>

80
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,680
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it gets skinnier at the ends</font>

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,780
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that buildings</font>

82
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,020
don't sort of cut into that path or

83
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,330
it'll in<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 you ate this the clearance</font>

84
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,920
so we needed somebody in a high place we

85
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to bounce this off somebody well</font>

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,670
that's when the Church of<font color="#E5E5E5"> latter-day</font>

88
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:40,500
here's a shot I don't know if you can

89
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:42,210
this one shows up cool if you look

90
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,460
really carefully you'll see a bunch of

91
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,840
satellite dishes way in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,940
on the left hand side on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the horizon</font>

93
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,890
there and that's 200 Paul and this is

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,890
seeing it from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice Griffith</font>

hype that's the person in high places so

97
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,780
to speak at least a place in high places

98
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:03,270
happens to be in between Alice Griffith

they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like doing things like this</font>

103
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">they really are into just doing public</font>

104
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,840
service and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a good thing</font>

105
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:18,149
out of it so they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very kind and</font>

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,000
help us put about four antennas up on

107
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:23,250
this side here this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking down to</font>

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,620
200 Paul if anybody's been to 200 Paul

109
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,720
you probably recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is a</font>

00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">great shot</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Griffith serve off on the left is the</font>

113
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,220
actual housing project itself you'll see

114
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,719
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a orange or red building kind of</font>

115
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,130
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the center of the picture that's a</font>

116
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,140
new building called the opportunity

117
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:43,460
center that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they they just built where</font>

118
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:46,430
they're going to be doing classes and

119
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:49,909
such so our goal was to try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

120
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:55,190
microwave shot into that<font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here's</font>

121
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:57,020
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> shot of that building this is an</font>

122
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,110
overhead actually thanks to microsoft

123
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:03,260
whatever you know Tara view thing is I

124
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,690
got this and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> building it's</font>

125
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,370
actually kind of a cool building it was

126
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:10,640
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> designed by Julia Morgan and</font>

127
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:13,640
Julia Morgan was William Randolph Hearst

128
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:16,820
sort of pet architect and she designed

129
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,530
San Simeon in size so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> built 1937</font>

130
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,180
so it has this really cool art decos

131
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,010
speed lines and everything else on it

132
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,690
and such but of course nobody goes there

133
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,880
and it's all covered with kind of

134
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,500
graffiti at this point but it's it's a

135
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,230
neat site if he ever can get up there on

136
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bottom you can see the examiners</font>

137
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:39,340

138

you have to run things by but once

convinced the it got through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like</font>

00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,880
to thank folks for that there's a this

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,710
is the elevator parapet which is on top

antenna that's just the left of ours

174
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,460
mounted on the roof there what happens

175
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,009
is the signal gets to the Alice

176
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">Griffiths site and then gets shot out</font>

just across the street<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then they</font>

180
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,590
have 2.4 gigahertz you know 802 11 BG

181
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:29,810
access points scattered all around as

182
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,039
well as wired connections and that's how

183
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,099
they get it from the opportunity center

184
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,310
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual housing project it was a</font>

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:41,110
big to-do there's our beloved mayor and

186
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:48,259
the governor's first lady sitting there

187
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:50,000
and anyway actually was very very easy

188
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,370
to deploy again technically there's

189
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,830
actually no deployment differences other

190
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,960
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may want to watch for carrier</font>

191
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,370
noise of signal annoys just in case

192
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,650
somebody goes up there and kicks the

193
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,960
antenna that so it's not aligned anymore

194
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,250
you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a problem where somebody</font>

195
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,169
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and starts using the same</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">frequency you use and see look for</font>

197
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:11,750
interference and such weather can can

198
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:13,370
change things things like that we use

199
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:16,669
standard network tools like khaki and

200
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:18,740

00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,350
it's costing us you know figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> $20 a</font>

228
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:22,209
a another housing project that's

229
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:25,000
basically directly over the hill from

230
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:27,130
that one which we can see again from the

231
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,440
koi transfer site one called hunters

232
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:31,000
view and then there's a bunch of housing

233
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,399
developments in call in an area called

234

we're actually putting in another<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5.8</font>

up and really it's it's not that costly

245
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,500
it's basically about five hundred

246
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,450
dollars for the cpe to install us and

247

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,709
if you do this sort of thing I do

255
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,270
encourage you to look at how you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

make your<font color="#E5E5E5"> community better and try to</font>

the people that usually can't afford it

00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,420
that too any questions look time for a

we're not we're not shooting sort of

other things we're actually shooting up

of the things where you get multiple
