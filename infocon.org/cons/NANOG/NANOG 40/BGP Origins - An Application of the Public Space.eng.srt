00:00:00,469 --> 00:00:06,240
good morning my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is erik oster while</font>

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:09,030
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a graduate student</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at UCLA</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,500
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> research lab so today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:13,649
be talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> system that we've</font>

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp origins and it's an</font>

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,130
application of a concept that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call</font>

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,619
the public space this work is in

8
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,320
collaboration with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Professor dan massey</font>

9
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,390
at colorado state university and

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:28,500
professor<font color="#E5E5E5"> beech wang shang at university</font>

11
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">of arizona as well so our system is</font>

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,759
motivated by observing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of a</font>

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-known</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem at this point which</font>

14
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,120
is that definitively being able to map

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,860
origins prefixes to origins that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:42,809
allowed to announce them is not

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,469
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> straight forward in sort of</font>

18
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on demand and that's mostly</font>

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,610
because it can depending on how it's

20
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:52,559
done fly in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the face of sort of</font>

21
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,510
operational autonomy basically being

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,370
able to sub allocate etc and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> forth</font>

23
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,899
being overlaid with a sort of a rigid

24
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,019
framework is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not necessarily</font>

25
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,000
straightforward and so our<font color="#CCCCCC"> system is</font>

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,280
motivated by basically the preceptor the

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,530
observation that maybe if we use sort of

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,600
real live real world trust relationships

29
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:13,350
maybe this situation becomes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

30
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,850
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> easier so there are a number of</font>

31
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,970
approaches that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist to deal with this</font>

32
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,820
in various ways today and so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> asn is a</font>

33
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,130
well-known example basically based on

34
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,289
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a registry mapping origins</font>

35
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:27,720
can or sort of origin origin owners can

36
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,390
be notified<font color="#E5E5E5"> when there's an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues in</font>

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,340
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a prefix hijack etc and</font>

38
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,439
again but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is based on essentially</font>

39
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,150
registry information information that is

40
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,029
registered that then potentially can

41
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,040
become stale a similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> approach that</font>

42
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,329
takes kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different angle is faz</font>

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,750
the prefix hijack alert system and while

44
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:50,880
that also 10 intends to notify people

45
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:53,820
not necessarily just the owners<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

46
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,710
hijack it makes its observe it makes its

47
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,169
conclusions or notifications based

48
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,539
strictly on observations so from

49
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,680
monitoring points around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world</font>

50
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,360
observing what the origin sets are and

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,930
then notifying anyone who signed up if

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,728
something has changed so these are great

53
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,590
there's no problem with we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

54
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think there's any issue with these</font>

55
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,290
approaches by themselves but what we owe

56
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,760
motivated by in part also is that third

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">parties people that aren't necessarily</font>

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,209
prefix owners are you know people that

59
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,680
have queries randomly at any given

60
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,810
moment not<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead of time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that they can</font>

61
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,090
sign up for should have a way to say i

62
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:29,190
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look up in origin mapping you</font>

63
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:31,100
know I see something<font color="#E5E5E5"> suspicious and I'd</font>

64
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what the status is so</font>

65
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:37,680
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of work in SI dr cider</font>

66
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:39,870
that that we think is great and you know

67
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,550
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> no bones with that at all what</font>

68
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,620
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize is that it's it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> underway</font>

69
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:47,550
and you know it<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a very good</font>

70
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,470
idea but it's not here today and until

71
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,060
it rolls it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> might be fair to</font>

72
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">say you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does it have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the sufficient</font>

73
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,590
granularity for again for operational

74
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:58,380
use do people<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have the needed</font>

75
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,460
autonomy to sell allocate etc so it's

76
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:03,390
more question it's not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

77
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,880
statement so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit</font>

78
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,410
about the approach we propose again<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp</font>

79
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,859
origins is an application of a concept

80
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,359
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we call the public space and in</font>

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:15,090
this context essentially what we're

82
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,460
saying is that anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make an</font>

83
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,020
attestation can claim that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

84
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,510
mapping between the prefix and an origin

85
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,230
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so they essentially proffer up</font>

86
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,780
their informed opinion and the system

87
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,299
itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp origins doesn't claim doesn't</font>

88
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">in any way try and verify that an Origin</font>

89
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,070
mapping is a good one it's not the

90
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:37,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">system's job to arbitrate to be the</font>

91
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,620
final<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer it essentially just lets</font>

92
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,790
people sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of put in their opinions and</font>

93
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,770
actually just sort of represents what's

94
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,480
kind of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> current consensus or</font>

95
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,680
thoughts about origin mappings I'll get

96
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the details soon so</font>

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,460
our main goal is really to provide more

98
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,760
or less a complimentary lookup system

99
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:58,980
service so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want to we want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> design</font>

100
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,239
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is automatable so I mean</font>

101
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,040
like it's great if you can call up your

102
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,480
buddy at an operation center somewhere

103
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,500
and say hey I'm seeing this weird

104
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,720
announcement do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is okay</font>

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,360
but what we'd really like to do and what

106
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">we've tried to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> origins is</font>

107
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,710
provide an automated framework so that

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,760
you can basically build a script<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

109
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,858
can sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of do a certain amount of</font>

110
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,170
arbitration automatically as sort of a

111
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,789
look at side mechanism basically use

112
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,530
information that's out there to see what

113
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,650
to do when something suspicious happens

114
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,419
and you know I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

115
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,750
the details but these user at the

116
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,560
station

117
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:33,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">our cryptographically signed so if for</font>

118
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,280
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say that I there's a mapping</font>

119
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:38,010
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one may care what I</font>

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,989
think but I certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't later say no</font>

121
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:44,370
no I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll apply</font>

122
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:46,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">a cryptographic signature so at eye</font>

123
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,660
level bgp origins runs off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two</font>

124
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,240
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> types of data sir data data</font>

125
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:52,980
streams one is observed data that sort

126
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,140
of called from around the world which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

127
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,360
basically monitored traffic update

128
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,000
streams etc and the other one the other

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,380
type of data comes from users as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I sort</font>

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,730
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> been alluding to users can make at</font>

131
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,219
the stations they can sort of claim

132
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:07,020
prefix origin mapping etc so these are

133
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,220
two you know fairly different types of

134
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,750
data sets but we were all them in

135
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:15,450
together because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we find we feel they're</font>

136
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,740
both important so<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP origins is sort of</font>

137
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:19,950
a rigorous framework and what that

138
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,320
basically means is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's something</font>

139
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's geared towards being automated so</font>

140
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,500
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I type the nice letter and I put it</font>

141
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,450
in BGP origins you know someone could

142
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,310
download it and read it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

143
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,200
they'd understand it but what we've done

144
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,729
is tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that you can</font>

145
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,200
easily<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of write a script to parse</font>

146
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,510
things out etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth the whole</font>

147
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">system is designed again to be kind of a</font>

148
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:43,590
framework to be automated on top of and

149
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:45,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">our I'm sorry so our input to the system</font>

150
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,539
is as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier</font>

151
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,280
cryptographically signed so our observed

152
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,669
data actually comes from faz which I

153
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,380
mentioned earlier and so we get a we get

154
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:57,810
a feed from them and we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

155
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,400
data is integral and then the user at

156
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stations actually signed by their</font>

157
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,560
PGP keys so in that sense we can do sort

158
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:09,240
of simple verification and we can do

159
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,740
online validation etc and the interface

160
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,080
to our system<font color="#CCCCCC"> is designed to be what we</font>

161
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,990
call quick but not dirty so in order to

162
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,030
make this very easy to use we've just

163
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:20,220
basically plugged the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS we basically</font>

164
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,599
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DA's protocol and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

165
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,340
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people can sort</font>

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,990
of queries from pan lined or you can

167
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,119
write a script with net DNS or any

168
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:29,280
number of other common tool sets to pull

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">data from our system and actually also</font>

170
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to upload data to our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> system as well so</font>

171
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,160
clients basically can as i<font color="#E5E5E5"> said earlier</font>

172
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,599
can verify you know the individual data

173
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,460
but now they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can also verify that the</font>

174
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,300
data comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> from us so what</font>

175
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,489
not saying that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're the most</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">trustworthy organization in the world</font>

177
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,460
you can certainly verify the signatures

178
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,930
yourself but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll verify that the data</font>

179

180
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:56,910
individually check it so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> btp</font>

what a valid mapping between a prefix

and an origin is and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> even close</font>

187
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,280
to what our systems trying to do we

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically provide a framework for you to</font>

completely different origin and you when

196
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,870
you asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a prefix will get both</font>

197
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:32,490
of these back and that's really left up

198
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,289
to the endpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the information</font>

202
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:43,830
to me<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all what we really do is tell</font>

203
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,180
you that the data did come from us we'll

204
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide you the origin authenticity that</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Beach be origin service to you wasn't a</font>

206
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,720
man in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle with her so let me try</font>

207
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">and maybe sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of pulls together and</font>

208
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,620
clear cleared up with an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example so I'll</font>

209
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,330
start off with what probably everyone

210
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,669
here knows it's just a simple discussion

211
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:02,820
about how things might work in with<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

212
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:04,580
so consider a timeline where at the

213
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:08,039
bottom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the screen you can see at T 0</font>

214
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,979
origin n has announced a prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

215
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:12,419
non-routable and depending on people's

216
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,979
position and<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet they'll hear that</font>

217
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sorry people hear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but let's</font>

218
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:18,330
suppose at t1 separate origin announces

219
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,979
the same prefix so now depending on

220
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,150
people's position the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet some of</font>

221
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:22,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">them will hear one some of them here</font>

222
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:23,940
other some people here both their

223
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,889
routers altima we'll probably just

224
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,639
choose a path but nominally some routers

225
00:08:25,889 --> 00:08:32,339
will hear both and some won't so Alice

226
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,250
on top right<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll t to a later point</font>

227
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:36,899
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok well i c'n so that's the mapping</font>

228
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,419
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bob down in the lower left-hand</font>

229
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:40,860
corner might see both and so if he's

230
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,328
inspecting this traffic he might very

231
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:43,979
well sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of wonder why all the sudden</font>

232
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:46,050
there are two you know that could be

233
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,829
valid could not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be valid but this point</font>

234
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:52,740
Bob doesn't really know anything so now

235
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:54,599
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP origins allows is Bob to</font>

236
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,230
basically do some some level of

237
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,720
investigate

238
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,730
so let's revise the situational bit

239
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:02,190
let's suppose that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice for whatever</font>

240
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:04,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason has previously decided that n</font>

241
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,240
should always be the origin for this

242
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,590
prefix now maybe Alice has some inside

243
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,810
information or maybe Alice just

244
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,550
maintains a list of<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known something</font>

245
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:13,949
or another's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of like you</font>

246
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">know like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bogan list now people</font>

247
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,120
maintain lists so suppose alice is one

248
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:20,130
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those people now when Bob who may</font>

249
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">very well be friends with Alice queries</font>

250
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">BGP origins based on this sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

251
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:26,280
interesting strange behavior what you'll

252
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,620
see is that origin sees in the baseline

253
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,390
data<font color="#CCCCCC"> eminem are both origins which he</font>

254
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,250
probably already knows because he<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked</font>

255
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:35,520
the question but he'll also see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that his</font>

256
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:37,590
buddy alice has vouched for or attested

257
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:40,560
to the fact that n should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the origin</font>

258
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:42,240
for this prefix so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point this</font>

259
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,489
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> is still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Bob's decision you know</font>

260
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,380
origins hasn't told Bob what to do but

261
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,210
now bob has some real useful information

262
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple way from anywhere on</font>

263
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet on demand whenever he wants</font>

264
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,030
it so given the question which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

265
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,920
origin is the right one pinions really

266
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,780
do very you know not everyone's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

267
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,800
trust Alice and people will have

268
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,780
different people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I trust and</font>

269
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,000
multiple people may make the same at the

270
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">station and as I said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier some</font>

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,680
people may provide different information

272
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">conflict</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ettore so it's really up to the</font>

273
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,270
endpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide whose opinion matters</font>

274
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,380
whose opinion really<font color="#E5E5E5"> should carry sway</font>

275
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:18,030
and you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

276
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,160
be automated within the concept of trust

277
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,750
anchors I come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a set of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keys</font>

278
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,719
ahead of time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I trust and those are</font>

279
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones I want to look for so when you</font>

280
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,440
query BGP origins you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get back again</font>

281
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,300
these two types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information you'll</font>

282
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,180
get back what's observed<font color="#E5E5E5"> around which</font>

283
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,069
was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> mm n tuple and you'll also get</font>

284
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,660
back the<font color="#CCCCCC"> attestation of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that you</font>

285
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:40,950
trust from this case it was Alice so how

286
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,930
does this<font color="#E5E5E5"> translate to any kind of</font>

287
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:46,710
operational use so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort of what</font>

288
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,780
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> envision operations you know maybe</font>

289
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,700
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> automating processes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even can</font>

290
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,800
basically start to use these trust

291
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:54,660
anchors maybe like files of key IDs or

292
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,640
something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they'll query</font>

293
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,890
for and they'll use to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

294
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,390
given a funny situation I'll arbitrate

295
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,730
in the following way these key hold sway

296
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,949
let me see what their opinions are but

297
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,200
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not up to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp origins</font>

298
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,420
and everyone at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint makes their</font>

299
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,670
own

300
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:11,469
decision different operation groups can

301
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,819
do completely different things based on

302
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,620
completely different sets of data not

303
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:16,300
because they'll only see some but

304
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:20,230
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> may only care about certain</font>

305
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:22,030
views and again as the picture sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

306
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,920
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe this is really kind of</font>

307
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:26,319
a look aside system it's not like we

308
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,360
propose to interpose between you know

309
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,130
accepting you know update announcements

310
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">at a router level and sort of discard</font>

311
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,510
things and so and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

312
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:36,670
mostly designed for forensics or you

313
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:38,140
know look aside in<font color="#E5E5E5"> validation so things</font>

314
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,610
can still we're not proposing any

315
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:44,590
changes to be GP or anything like that

316
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:46,630
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I'll talk a little bit about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

317
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,370
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of data the observed data as</font>

318
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:51,939
opposed to the user data which I'll talk

319
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:53,890
about later so our observed data comes

320
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,780
from viewing<font color="#E5E5E5"> data from multiple peering</font>

321
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,819
points around the internet and we

322
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually get this by just simply taking</font>

323
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,920
a feed and from faz and fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually is</font>

324
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,600
was the subject of an earlier talk I

325
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,250
believe it was Nana 38 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I have the</font>

326
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,200
link here if people aren't familiar with

327
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:13,690
it by all means<font color="#E5E5E5"> check it out but</font>

328
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,600
basically what what faz does is it pulls

329
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,400
feeds from<font color="#CCCCCC"> ralphs use and it processes</font>

330
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,380
them and among other things it looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

331
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,850
origin changes it says this origin has

332
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,530
been added to this prefixes origins been

333
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:25,210
removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> from this prefix and so since</font>

334
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:27,220
it's already done<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work of going</font>

335
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,770
getting data from all around the world

336
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,180
and coming up with a simple digested

337
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,069
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what we want kind of</font>

338
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,510
data stream it frees<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp origins from</font>

339
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,640
having to reinvent the wheel<font color="#CCCCCC"> again and</font>

340
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,230
in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> from talking with the fast</font>

341
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm under the impression that</font>

342
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,820
they're working towards integration with

343
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:44,110
r is the ripe<font color="#E5E5E5"> NCC data set which for us</font>

344
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:50,410
is great because it means we get a

345
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:52,540
richer data set for free so um again oh

346
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:53,890
so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do with this data set</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

347
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,880
rather than give you all the noise of

348
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:56,140
announced withdrawal<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced</font>

349
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">withdrawal we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually try and do a</font>

350
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:02,530
certain amount of of smoothing and this

351
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,240
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually where I really want to make</font>

352
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:06,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clear that the system is an</font>

353
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,920
early is an early development system and

354
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:11,440
it is very strongly encouraged or I'm

355
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,819
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very open to comment in fact we</font>

356
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,750
would love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get feedback about this so</font>

357
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,700
what I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into now is</font>

358
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,560
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we think might be</font>

359
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,990
useful our first our idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a first</font>

360
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,250
step and what we hope<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that when you</font>

361
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,020
query the system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gives you back</font>

362
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,220
useful data set that<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe by itself</font>

363
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,680
doesn't tell you the absolute truth

364
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,120
because again it's not going to be easy

365
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">to come up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the absolute truth but</font>

366
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,230
maybe just filters out some obvious

367
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:33,520
noise and so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm i'm very</font>

368
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,780
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> hearing your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feedback if</font>

369
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,490
you think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is way off in the weeds</font>

370
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'd love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear it if you think this</font>

371
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,340
could be tweaked or if you think that

372
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,650
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be better you know</font>

373
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:43,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know comments are great grabbing</font>

374
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:45,250
afterwards whatever you want but this

375
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,930
whole system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically it's a work in</font>

376
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:49,270
progress and it's designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be useful</font>

377
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to this audience so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I would love</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

378
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,740
feedback at any point that being said

379
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:57,550
this was this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our initial first step</font>

380
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,230
so we kind of take this this data set

381
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,000
from faz which is nominally kind of

382
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:02,740
noisy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice withdraws and we just</font>

383
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,180
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know run a low-pass filter</font>

384
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,100
on it just filter out things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that seem</font>

385
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,300
like they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty clearly not</font>

386
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,710
interesting like if you're actually

387
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,270
asking question what should the real

388
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,120
urgent be are there certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

389
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:15,160
can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of kick out so we use a</font>

390
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,750
moving average it's an exponentially

391
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,130
weighted moving average for those

392
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,590
interested this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very simple</font>

393
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:23,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">formulation of it but essentially what</font>

394
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does is over time it keeps an average</font>

395
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,300
for each prefix origin binding and it

396
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,729
says and what it's trying to do is it's

397
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to squelch transient withdraws or</font>

398
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,670
transiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> announcements drawls so</font>

399
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,890
something that shows up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and goes away</font>

400
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,780
shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and goes away we presume that</font>

401
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:39,160
this is not going to be the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data</font>

402
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:41,410
you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see when you ask about in</font>

403
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,990
origin so this this average will squelch

404
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,260
that it'll also basically you know

405
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,760
reward or upgrade consistency origins

406
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,770
that constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> announce the same prefix</font>

407
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,680
will have a high average and they'll be

408
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,089
presented and it we've geared it to sort

409
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">of except newcomers for you know</font>

410
00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:58,690
emergency situations where<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new ASO</font>

411
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,700
announced a prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've never seen</font>

412
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">before you know start off better than</font>

413
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:06,820
these sort of announced<font color="#CCCCCC"> withdrawal</font>

414
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:08,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">transients so the reason we did it this</font>

415
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,820
way is we tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of pick some</font>

416
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,069
examples of things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know people</font>

417
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:14,530
even at nanak here have served basically

418
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,260
identified as not good so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

419
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:19,810
there's an earlier talk by famed by nick

420
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,439
feemster that basically said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

421
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,939
one pattern of spammers announced /a not

422
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,680
really hijack but they announced the / 8

423
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,440
and they spam for 10 minutes at a time

424
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:31,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I understand</font>

425
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,680
it these are a very consistent mapping

426
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,160
in other words we will have seen them

427
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,930
before

428
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,850
and while they're away we will be

429
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,160
degrading their their average will be

430
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:40,449
degrading so when they announce origins

431
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,009
will not react to them favorable it

432
00:15:40,449 --> 00:15:43,689
won't immediately present that data to

433
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:45,040
you so nominally if you have you know

434
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:46,629
suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> this origin that you don't know</font>

435
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,069
what to do with you know you'll ask

436
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:51,459
origins in order to say I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

437
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:53,620
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one because it's been squelched and</font>

438
00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:54,969
again our thought was also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

439
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,980
nominally when there's a large outage

440
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:58,569
outage it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it knew a ton</font>

441
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,579
of the system may announce the prefix it

442
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:02,709
was previously announced elsewhere if

443
00:16:00,579 --> 00:16:04,540
we've never seen that mapping before we

444
00:16:02,709 --> 00:16:05,589
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> will give it not exactly the</font>

445
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,449
benefit of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> doubt we won't</font>

446
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,740
immediately say you're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> aces with us</font>

447
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:14,490
but we'll probably present it pretty

448
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,490
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not mine</font>

449
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:30,319
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but anyway so we'll try to</font>

450
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,430
present new mappings and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> again this</font>

451
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,519
is entirely submitted for your approval

452
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,989
so again if if people feel by and large

453
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,399
that this is a really super way to do

454
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,649
things you know that that's perfectly

455
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,819
valid feedback we just try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make kind</font>

456
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:42,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an informed decision but what we</font>

457
00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:45,290
really want is to provide a<font color="#E5E5E5"> usable</font>

458
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,000
workable system so keep that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind and</font>

459
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:48,410
comments are totally welcome even if you

460
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,290
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that exactly again that's solely</font>

461
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,850
cool but anyway just to sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of to sort</font>

462
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,319
of solidify that last point here's a

463
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,139
here's a slide from a previous

464
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:59,240
presentation that essentially shows that

465
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,889
announcement through drawers for these

466
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,040
spamming prefixes you know are in the

467
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:05,419
order of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is so these</font>

468
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,099
sorts of data points are what we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

469
00:17:05,419 --> 00:17:10,669
use to come up with why we would do this

470
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:12,079
what weighted moving average so now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

471
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:13,250
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second type of data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

472
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,770
we use in the system which is user

473
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,480
feedback so what we recognize is that

474
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,400
you know operational trust you know

475
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,780
people whose opinions matter is often

476
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">gained externally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to any kind of</font>

477
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,899
automated system like here at nano

478
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,270
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet people you'll go to Keith</font>

479
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,500
signing parties etc and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

480
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,700
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the names that you may trust</font>

481
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,409
and the key sending parties might help

482
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,760
you bind the person to some sort of

483
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:35,419
cryptographic entity that you can then

484
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,650
verify and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

485
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:38,720
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and basically I'm going to kind of</font>

486
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,520
try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> move it along this is something</font>

487
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">that basically we think will be very</font>

488
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,389
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you then want to see if you</font>

489
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:45,950
know users own so it's really said that

490
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a mapping or if it's somebody</font>

491
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:50,720
who's spoofing their name go to the key

492
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,730
sign party and then you know and since

493
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,770
we're using a<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS interface you know you</font>

494
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,730
can use dig you can basically just dig

495
00:17:54,770 --> 00:18:00,408
our database right now and it and if you

496
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,480
doubt me go<font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead and do it right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now so</font>

497
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sillies prefix</font>

498
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,890
and if you literally just run this

499
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,860
command dig and you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reverse the</font>

500
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:14,270
octet sand and the masking<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get dig</font>

501
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,949
1600 179 131 actions bgp org txt record

502
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,690
you'll get back this screen and what you

503
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:22,130
can basically see in the answer section

504
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I hope if that's clear is that there are</font>

505
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,830
two records the first one looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like i</font>

506
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:31,700
vouched for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ASM 52 so you parse this by</font>

507
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,320
saying prefix colon asn colon the key

508
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,929
idea that's vouched for it colon the

509
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,908
name of that person and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last token</font>

510
00:18:35,929 --> 00:18:39,529
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually what this is actually the</font>

511
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,450
code so one means that I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

512
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:43,490
good mapping to means I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

513
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,990
bad mapping and I can then revoke that

514
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,519
signature later so you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> never see a</font>

515
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,499
three but three will clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out and</font>

516
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:50,539
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one with no information is</font>

517
00:18:48,499 --> 00:18:55,220
the baseline data that's what we call

518
00:18:50,539 --> 00:18:58,190
from faz so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you submit data is</font>

519
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">also very simple so we require that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

520
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,690
key that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you submit is</font>

521
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:04,909
signed by either PGP or<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg and we chose</font>

522
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,679
these we<font color="#E5E5E5"> chose basically PGP because</font>

523
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,999
it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ubiquitous there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

524
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:09,499
online key servers that make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

525
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:11,059
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us to get keys and so and so</font>

526
00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:13,129
forth but also the level of granularity

527
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:14,629
was just we thought was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just right so</font>

528
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:16,699
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are lots of ways you could sign</font>

529
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:18,830
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of using DNS we could</font>

530
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,139
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> used DNS SEC but what we really</font>

531
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,480
think is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you will care about what</font>

532
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,729
somebody you've met things so DNS SEC

533
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,519
the granularity of the keys is not per

534
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,470
person necessarily but PGP is generally

535
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,600
can also be organizations etc but the

536
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,220
idea is that I may show up with a key of

537
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,049
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key signing party you recognize this</font>

538
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,850
as me in person and<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now on when you</font>

539
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:43,399
see my at the station you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's me</font>

540
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:45,379
if you care<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have simple simple</font>

541
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:46,639
reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> scripts that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show at the</font>

542
00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:47,809
end decide where to get it in the

543
00:19:46,639 --> 00:19:49,309
presentation where to get but for

544
00:19:47,809 --> 00:19:52,490
example this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how you would use the</font>

545
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,869
reference script to update our ad in at

546
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:55,909
the station you just simply run the

547
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:57,049
command line with a dash a it'll sort of

548
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:58,730
walk you through what origin do you

549
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:00,049
think that prefix belongs to are you

550
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,809
trusting it distrusting you want to

551
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:04,820
revoke something and then it'll sort of

552
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:06,379
plug into<font color="#E5E5E5"> gpg and say hey you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know type</font>

553
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:10,789
in your passphrase<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sign it set it</font>

554
00:20:06,379 --> 00:20:14,330
off so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we the way this</font>

555
00:20:10,789 --> 00:20:16,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole thing works is GP GP GP verify</font>

556
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,918
individual<font color="#CCCCCC"> user signatures we get these</font>

557
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,179
keys from key servers so basically you

558
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,590
need to have your key somewhere where we

559
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:23,210
can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it and other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

560
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:27,619
could actually get it so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

561
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:29,149
pull from the MIT key server we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

562
00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:30,949
to basically make this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

563
00:20:29,149 --> 00:20:33,258
people to plug in write scripts you know

564
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:35,929
net like i said before net<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns or dig or</font>

565
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:38,149
whatever you want and similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns</font>

566
00:20:35,929 --> 00:20:39,409
updates work the same way and our simple

567
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:41,059
reference scripts are basically designed

568
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,769
just to sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you play</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it</font>

569
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,889
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I hope some of you are doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

570
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">and essentially you can rewrite this</font>

571
00:20:45,889 --> 00:20:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself the scripts should be very easy</font>

572
00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:50,630
and well commented so that you can

573
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:52,370
basically if you have a framework where

574
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,840
this would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be useful you know either</font>

575
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:58,909
user scripts or write your own to plug

576
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:00,590
in so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in conclusion I'd like</font>

577
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:02,059
to highlight the beach be origins is you

578
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,580
may sir I<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope you've sort of glean is</font>

579
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,590
not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's data is</font>

580
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,990
the right data that's kind of something

581
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,428
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel is going to be left to use the</font>

582
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,110
operational community you as a user

583
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:13,670
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically going to decide what do</font>

584
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,530
you think based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information but</font>

585
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,390
at the same time we're giving you<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

586
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:19,520
venue and a framework so that

587
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,440
automatically you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can say you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

588
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,900
matters to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> what this operator has</font>

589
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,940
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if this operator happens to</font>

590
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:27,350
have said something about this previous

591
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,110
crapping that I'm seeing then that's

592
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,510
great that helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> me a lot that basically</font>

593
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,709
shifts the onus on to the end user but

594
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,080
nominally that might be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

595
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:37,460
nominally you know that might be exactly

596
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,350
what allows you to make this system

597
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,270
useful we hope but it's a

598
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:42,709
non-repudiation framework no one can say

599
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,059
I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> made that at the station will</font>

600
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,920
give you the signature you can check it

601
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:48,290
yourself and it's actually online<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

602
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,990
now so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know nominally we hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

603
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:53,360
becomes useful ASAP because it's ready

604
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:55,190
to be used and again we'd love<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear</font>

605
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,050
feedback there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more</font>

606
00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">information at our website which is on</font>

607
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,580
this last light and are so our reference

608
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:03,080
scripts are also linked there so you can

609
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,939
go to that and download the script it's

610
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,280
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Perl but that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just basically a</font>

611
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:13,160
pragmatic choice so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very much</font>

612
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,450
I wonder if there any questions yeah

613
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,500
well people were coming to the mics

614
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,840
would Clarence please come up here thanx

615
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:24,200
SiC appears you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adult use</font>

616
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:26,540
historical data but not the route

617
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:31,340
objects from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IRS is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that correct</font>

618
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:34,370
that's correct and just a car request

619
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,830
your slides on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog website seem to</font>

620
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:40,280
be older<font color="#CCCCCC"> set can you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> update that please</font>

621
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,510
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sent them out maybe a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

622
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,639
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> late sighs but they should be out</font>

623
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try and make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font>

624
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,710
properly updated it is one more question

625
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,439
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often do you update the database</font>

626
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:55,429
like routers I guess you get every 15

627
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,710
minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get new data we go sorry</font>

628
00:22:55,429 --> 00:23:00,230
sorry go ahead we pull live feed from

629
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,510
faz faz updates we<font color="#E5E5E5"> update and as I</font>

630
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,960
understand it fast pulls feet data from

631
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">ralphs you</font>

632
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,399
as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it's available so essentially</font>

633
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,309
we update as soon as possible<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font>

634
00:23:09,399 --> 00:23:15,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">Majesty Abbas not really a question</font>

635
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,178
since you're using PGP and encouraging

636
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,649
people to go to key signings i figured i

637
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:20,510
just mentioned that the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> naoki</font>

638
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:22,969
signing session is<font color="#E5E5E5"> up at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1045 break</font>

639
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,440
right through those doors on the left it

640
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:27,679
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too late</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for people to get me</font>

641
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,149
their keys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know now that might</font>

642
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually be something very useful we</font>

643
00:23:29,149 --> 00:23:33,979
hope you know we hope to encourage so

644
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:35,899
again please feel free to<font color="#CCCCCC"> grab me at any</font>

645
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,309
point especially if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> my moving</font>

646
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:40,489
average I are moving average ideas

647
00:23:37,309 --> 00:23:42,470
subpar we're all ears we'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear</font>

648
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:45,549
any feedback and please give the system

649
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,549
a shot if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think it's useful</font>

650
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,049
excellent thank you
