1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,460
a new algorithm to to tackle with the

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:18,150
root cause analysis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP analysis of</font>

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:19,830
anomaly in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> VP sorry so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> joint</font>

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,689
work with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Antony long bear and Jonny</font>

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,930
crew tone on tone in objects should have

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:29,369
present this work but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do it for him</font>

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:34,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so as so many people know any event</font>

8
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:40,590
a localized in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an es can raise updates</font>

9
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:44,340
all over the BGP network and we think we

10
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:48,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe a tool that will detect and also</font>

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:52,649
localize those events can be very useful

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:57,050
to to help network operation center

13
00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:01,170
during oth and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also to detect some small</font>

14
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:06,240
recurrent<font color="#E5E5E5"> Evans then can that can that</font>

15
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:10,170
can arrive many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we also think</font>

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,460
it could be useful to detect some some

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,460
peer of some areas that are not variable

18
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:20,839
ok so the principles is to collect some

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:25,880
bgp updates at multi vantage points and

20
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:30,630
then to identify events and to localize

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:33,140
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for those events in fact</font>

22
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,720
so there is two steps in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these methods</font>

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:39,720
first we've got to decompose the stream

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,798
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates and to cluster eyes on sub</font>

25
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:49,020
days into two sets and the sets would

26
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:51,689
represent the would represent a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

27
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">heaven and then given any event we have</font>

28
00:01:51,689 --> 00:02:00,429
to localize the responsible for this

29
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:05,350
heavens<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so there are many challenge</font>

30
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:10,200
in such an algorithm first we've got

31
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:15,010
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> only some lessons echoes of</font>

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:18,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">the events because the bishop he updates</font>

33
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:22,090
are spread all over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network and we</font>

34
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:25,179
only got some some data from a few

35
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:27,130
monitoring points I mean public

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:32,500
monitoring points like reviews or write

37
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:35,130
or ripe rice<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and the effects of</font>

38
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">those events</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are spread over time</font>

39
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:42,459
because of timers for example so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

40
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:48,640
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendor specific</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if the effects of</font>

41
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:52,180
those events<font color="#E5E5E5"> can can be very spreaded</font>

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:58,299
over time so as we will see in many

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:01,780
previous work the without many updates

44
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:05,290
this updates generated but by the same

45
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:09,870
event can happen closing time so it is

46
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:12,600
usually true but not always and finally

47
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:17,049
one of the issue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this work is that</font>

48
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:22,530
the data is strongly based I mean when

49
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:30,160
we monitor at advantage<font color="#E5E5E5"> points we are we</font>

50
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:33,970
we usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the topological I mean</font>

51
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:38,640
AAS pass near this the monitoring points

52
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:42,489
that spread it over the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

53
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:47,078
main ideas in the previous approach was

54
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:50,650
to use timers to identify bgp updates

55
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:53,400
related to the same events so they could

56
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:56,650
also use some kind of aggregation and

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,130
then to tackle the localization of the

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:02,410
responsible yes they suppose so the

59
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:06,000
responsible for those events are either

60
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:08,560
on the old<font color="#CCCCCC"> path of the new best pass</font>

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,910
there are several limitations from those

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,700
approach first as we will say later time

63
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,060
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

64
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:22,070
the best criterium to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

65
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:26,180
havens in fact in the detection of V<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

66
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:28,280
burst of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp updates</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the big events are</font>

67
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cannavale a kind of cannibalizing the</font>

68
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:36,739
small ones in fact all the events are

69
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:39,430
merged into the flow of updates and some

70
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,620
events can be divided<font color="#E5E5E5"> into several ones</font>

71
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:45,440
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually methods that close ur eyes</font>

72
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:52,340
updates based on burst cannot do that

73
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:55,969
and finally we could we could see that

74
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:58,310
with the detection of such events based

75
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,270
on burst we have to wait<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

76
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:05,720
complete events to detect it and as we

77
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:08,750
will see in our methods we can we can

78
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:14,300
throw an alarm as soon as<font color="#E5E5E5"> events is</font>

79
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:16,610
detected<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will show several</font>

80
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:24,590
assumptions that found our methodology

81
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:30,289
now so first we collected bgp double

82
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:33,409
dumps from 16 Reuters at lags so this is

83
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the root user it is at the reviews</font>

84
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:42,110
monitoring point so we collected one bgp

85
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:46,690
table per day during<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 months and what</font>

86
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:52,430
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see in this in this figure is</font>

87
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so we compute the path from each</font>

88
00:05:52,430 --> 00:06:00,229
source to each prefix the path that is

89
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">the most seen during the whole period so</font>

90
00:06:00,229 --> 00:06:07,250
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we started with 11 month then two</font>

91
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,729
months till six month and what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

92
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:18,979
say for example if we can we can see

93
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:25,070
that for<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if you look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the x</font>

94
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:27,139
axis axis at the half of the x axis you

95
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:33,139
can see that less some

96
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:40,539
two or three percent of of Paris source

97
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:47,330
destination use this bus more than half

98
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:52,279
the period I mean I will try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out</font>

99
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:55,099
this figure if we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the red one at</font>

100
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:59,169
the rights of the figure we can see that

101
00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:05,000
eighty percent of the monetary pairs

102
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:09,770
they use the same AAS pass for for the

103
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:14,020
prefix or during all the snapshot so

104
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:17,240
what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rooter will</font>

105
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:21,198
preferentially use the same AAS pass

106
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:26,360
during a long period to each prefix so

107
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:31,250
that is strong assumptions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font>

108
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:34,479
second assumptions we saw this stability

109
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:41,330
of BGP routing from Reuters to prefixes

110
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:45,500
now we will try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if pass AAS pass</font>

111
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:51,099
to prefixes originated by is the same es

112
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:55,099
are the same or not so look at the red

113
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:59,210
look at the red one it's it shows the

114
00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:01,069
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of prefixes originated by ases so</font>

115
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,219
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for example forty</font>

116
00:08:01,069 --> 00:08:09,379
percent of es is originated one prefix

117
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:11,810
and they are small there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> small set</font>

118
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:16,449
of fears that<font color="#CCCCCC"> originate so many prefix I</font>

119
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:21,740
mean hundreds to thousands of prefixes

120
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:24,050
now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get a look on primary path so</font>

121
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:26,750
the path that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is most used from each</font>

122
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:31,209
hotel to each prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> to those prefixes</font>

123
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:36,620
of the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> originated we can see that</font>

124
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:38,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">eighty percent of origin s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've for</font>

125
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,979
eighty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of originals we've got</font>

126
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:46,250
the same

127
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:49,910
AAS pass from the vantage point<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

128
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:54,740
if we take into account<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

129
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:59,089
neighbor of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original yes I mean we</font>

130
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:03,199
try to know if rueter will use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

131
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:07,850
AAS pass to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different prefix of an</font>

132
00:09:03,199 --> 00:09:11,120
original yes passing by the same name

133
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:16,310
neighbor of this original yes we can see

134
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:21,680
that ninety-five percent of originates

135
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:24,410
neighbor pairs for those ninety-five

136
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:31,939
percent or monitoring points use the

137
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:35,209
same pass so we can say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp routing</font>

138
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:39,350
seems to be more a neighbor to neighbor

139
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:43,880
routing than a Rooter to<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefix routing</font>

140
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:45,980
I mean yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> originate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the prefixes the</font>

141
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,160
prefixes is announced to the first

142
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:52,130
neighbor and then prefixes are routed

143
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,370
the same way I mean in routing policies

144
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:57,380
the usually administrator will not

145
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,160
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> differentiate those prefixes</font>

146
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:04,880
originated by the same yes so this is

147
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:08,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second assumption of our method so</font>

148
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:12,560
now we've got trees from origin es to

149
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:16,540
our collectors so what we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say with</font>

150
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:20,540
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if an event occurs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

151
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:25,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">originating is the primary path will be</font>

152
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:29,180
affected so now we are thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

153
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:32,630
trees from the originating yes so those

154
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:36,739
trees AR trees of primary path and now

155
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:39,050
we try to look at the inter arrival time

156
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,310
of those updates at our monitoring

157
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:48,349
points so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> red curve shows this</font>

158
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:49,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">entire arrival time what we can say</font>

159
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that</font>

160
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:57,420
so the time it's the time between two

161
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:04,709
primary path from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same tree are</font>

162
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:08,310
disappearing are disappearing so for for

163
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:13,740
half of the primary of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pair's</font>

164
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:17,099
monitor read it is under we can say 60

165
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:21,840
seconds so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a primary path</font>

166
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:24,680
disappear then for half the case we will

167
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:30,780
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> another primary path disappear under</font>

168
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:35,099
100 seconds and the red the right part

169
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:38,400
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the curve we can say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there that</font>

170
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:41,550
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time between the</font>

171
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:43,920
disappearing of primary pass from one

172
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:47,969
collecting point to another so we decide

173
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,449
to to remove the detection of those

174
00:11:47,970 --> 00:12:00,150
disappearing at all monitoring points

175
00:11:50,450 --> 00:12:06,750
for different time threshold so the for

176
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:10,709
example the the green one so we we

177
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:13,320
decide to forget we've seen a primary

178
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:17,640
path path disappearing after two minutes

179
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:20,460
I mean a primary path disappear and if

180
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:23,670
no other primary path disappear two

181
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after we decide to forget the</font>

182
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:30,439
fact that we we've seen a path this path

183
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:35,550
disappear and we can say with this

184
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:40,340
assumption with this removal that the

185
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:44,599
conversions time is about 100 seconds so

186
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:48,170
what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say about that if so if we</font>

187
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,780
if we see at a monitoring point a

188
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:55,260
primary path disappear then if we don't

189
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:59,010
see after 100 seconds another the same

190
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:02,230
primary path no primary path disappear

191
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:05,380
to the same prefix then we can say the

192
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:08,740
it is finished so this with this will

193
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:15,160
help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the future okay so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

194
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:21,340
the methodology so given<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set of BGP</font>

195
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:25,829
updates oui oui this flow of BGP updates

196
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:30,160
we transform it into a set of an<font color="#CCCCCC"> area</font>

197
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:33,310
unavailable an available primary path so

198
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,530
in fact we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't keep updates that</font>

199
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,709
educates that do not educate primary

200
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:42,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">path we just keep trees from originals</font>

201
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:45,610
of the primary path that are disappeared

202
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,740
so wanna so for example we get we can

203
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">for example we are in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states on the</font>

204
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:55,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">left we've got four trees one updates</font>

205
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:58,810
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> pgp updates arrive at a monitoring</font>

206
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:02,530
point and this update tell that the

207
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:07,229
primary path from s 1 to s 11 disappear

208
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:10,270
so we update the trees from the AAS 11

209
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:19,570
that's how we deal with the flow of<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP</font>

210
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:23,590
updates okay now to to deal with the

211
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:29,710
detection of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the responsible for and</font>

212
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:32,140
from any s for each originating s we

213
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:34,600
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> compute the intersection of an</font>

214
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:38,920
available primary path so for example

215
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:43,690
for the blue trees we get only one link

216
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:46,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">1 s link from a s11 tu es 12 for the</font>

217
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:50,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">green part we get the all three and four</font>

218
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:54,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">the pink one we get one link so from</font>

219
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:58,150
those trees we get those sub trees that

220
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,730
is the intersection then from this

221
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:04,540
rejection we try to correlate the

222
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:13,600
several trees to get more to the

223
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:18,410
responsible yes so so we decompose each

224
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,150
shiftry's is<font color="#CCCCCC"> shiftry into AAS</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> links so</font>

225
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,750
the green one was decomposed into

226
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:28,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">fallings and then we try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to identify a s</font>

227
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:31,340
links that appear in<font color="#E5E5E5"> several trees so we</font>

228
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:34,880
design a greedy heuristic that will

229
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:39,050
select links that have here in the most

230
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:44,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">an available primary path so we detect</font>

231
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:48,020
those links and then so we get the first

232
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:53,360
link that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up here are the</font>

233
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:55,130
most in the most unavailable trees then

234
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,670
we detect all the trees that can be

235
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:02,210
explained from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this link we remove all</font>

236
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:07,699
these trees<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we compute the step</font>

237
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:12,010
another time so at the at the end so

238
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:15,890
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can we so we selected the first</font>

239
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:19,819
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> 11-2 s12 he appears in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the most</font>

240
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:25,640
unavailable trees then we select<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

241
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:28,250
link between a s 15 and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 32 so one more</font>

242
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:30,860
time we remove tree that can be

243
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:33,430
explained<font color="#E5E5E5"> with these links and then the</font>

244
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:35,750
last trees so sorry the orange one

245
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:39,709
cannot be explained by your<font color="#CCCCCC"> sigil link</font>

246
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:43,400
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we select free es links so this set</font>

247
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:47,810
of five links can explain all the faded

248
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:51,860
trees so now we will try to improve the

249
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:54,890
detection and we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to see if any</font>

250
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:59,090
s can explain more<font color="#E5E5E5"> those faded trees</font>

251
00:16:54,890 --> 00:17:03,020
than links so we split each of the link

252
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:07,100
into to ESS and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to identify</font>

253
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:12,579
an ESN can explain more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than links in</font>

254
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:16,280
this example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s15 can explain the</font>

255
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:22,579
fading of moultrie than the links why

256
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:25,520
we're so in fact we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we selected to</font>

257
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:31,280
responsible for all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> faded trees we</font>

258
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,800
add 2 we get to events the one that is

259
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,830
one first event is the an event

260
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:40,159
occurring at from at healing from a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s11</font>

261
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:46,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">to s 12 so this link can explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

262
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:48,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">trees to phila trees then with the s15</font>

263
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,250
we can explain the failing of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

264
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:56,240
remaining trees so what did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do in</font>

265
00:17:52,250 --> 00:18:02,210
fact we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have transformed the stream</font>

266
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:05,780
of updates into a stream of events so we

267
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:09,260
get an<font color="#E5E5E5"> eye available primary path than</font>

268
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,990
the unavailable trees and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

269
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:16,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> events so those two events can</font>

270
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:22,480
explain all unavailable primary pass

271
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:26,390
within and now given so this step is a

272
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,660
realized on<font color="#CCCCCC"> real time many times it's a</font>

273
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:35,990
very quick step and we decide to extract

274
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:41,390
an event when we do not receive a new

275
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:43,760
update of a tree after two minutes so

276
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:45,910
this fact was explained by the entire

277
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,450
River time of<font color="#CCCCCC"> bgp updates we saw</font>

278
00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:56,150
previously so we try to validate this

279
00:18:50,450 --> 00:19:00,820
algorithm so we took data at 16 Reuters

280
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:05,360
at the root<font color="#CCCCCC"> view spirit ranks we get a</font>

281
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:09,590
37 million per prefix announcement from

282
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:12,020
those updates seventeen percent were

283
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,070
indicating the innate ability of a

284
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,560
primary path an aging process we're

285
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:22,010
educating the I've ability of a primary

286
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:30,610
path so from all<font color="#CCCCCC"> this flow of updates so</font>

287
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:36,550
one month of flow we get 134,000 events

288
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:36,550
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's that and this represents only</font>

289
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:45,679
sixty thousand distinct events<font color="#E5E5E5"> so no it</font>

290
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:52,760
is not really validated for the moment

291
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:56,750
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take oth tickets from the as50 5511</font>

292
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:00,080
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s from france telecom and we look</font>

293
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:01,880
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> failures and oth and we try</font>

294
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:07,129
to validate<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can solve those</font>

295
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:09,320
failures with our algorithm in fact for

296
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:12,529
half of the events we saw in the tickets

297
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,658
we are not seen in BGP data but for all

298
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:18,260
the events that can be seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in BGP data</font>

299
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:21,020
we only want to fight them and in fact

300
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:26,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">we also identify small events that can</font>

301
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:29,059
happen several times so here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

302
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:32,539
curve that shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many times an event</font>

303
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:35,629
occur so the same event I mean the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

link or the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS explaining the</font>

305
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:42,890
fading of many trees so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can see that</font>

306
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:46,610
eighty percent of events are seen only

307
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:51,649
one time but there are events that can

308
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:57,559
be seen more than six there is one event

309
00:20:51,649 --> 00:21:00,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was seen sixty thousand times so</font>

310
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:06,289
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a recurring events that can</font>

311
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:09,529
never be seen with previous approach so

312
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:12,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">the here is the summary of contributions</font>

313
00:21:09,529 --> 00:21:15,320
so we design a method to cope with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

314
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:20,580
challenging problem of entitlement root

315
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:23,220
cause analysis so our aim was to inform

316
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:27,149
network operations center that Evans has

317
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:30,750
occurred as early as they can be

318
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:34,279
detected so methodology really breaks

319
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:39,289
with previous approach as we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not use</font>

320
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:43,860
time threshold to detect the heavens

321
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:46,350
instead we use a we use topological

322
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:49,769
consideration that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we derived from real</font>

323
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:52,709
data so the time information is<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

324
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:56,519
used to extract events I mean we extract

325
00:21:52,710 --> 00:22:03,750
an event when we do not see an available

326

ongoing job is to automate this tool and

and we we hope to get feedback<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the</font>
