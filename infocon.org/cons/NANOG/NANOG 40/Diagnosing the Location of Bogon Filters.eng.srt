1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,370
oh my co-conspirators fellow researchers

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,660
they're actually academics so we have

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:15,629
paper in somewhere and they care about

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:19,259
this stuff cute the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogen</font>

5
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,869
filters you're familiar with them we

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,359
intend to filter unallocated address

7
00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,448
space including 1918 the stuff the I

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,250
anna hasn't given out etc etc in order

9
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:31,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">to protect ourselves from malicious tax</font>

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:36,450
and unwanted traffic because we believe

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:39,420
that there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out there who sin</font>

12
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,960
from that space over time this

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:46,320
unallocated address space may become

14
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,379
allocated given down from the I am into

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,449
the registries used announced etc and

16
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,760
then we see all the whining on the nanog

17
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:59,730
list and the other operators list saying

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:03,930
I've just<font color="#CCCCCC"> been assigned 9630 82 6642 and</font>

19
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,750
I can't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to X so the problem is the</font>

20
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:11,280
filters need to be updated but they seem

21
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,430
often not to be now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you know</font>

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:19,380
why but there's a hidden secret here the

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:27,200
real cause is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jolie a Glee has been</font>

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,199
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to guess who you never knew this</font>

25
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,970
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the root cause but in</font>

26
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,100
typical engineer trashing instead of

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,100
dealing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the real problem at layer 9</font>

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:46,289
i'm going to tack it at layer 3<font color="#CCCCCC"> and 4</font>

29
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so the objective is to develop a</font>

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:51,630
methodology that's capable of detecting

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,520
and locating them not just what we've

32
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,170
been doing previously is here's an

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,840
address you can ping if you can't get to

34
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:01,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">it go figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it out charlie it's</font>

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,630
actually locating it to analyze the

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,798
reach ability status of an allocated

37
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:11,730
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and say where the failures</font>

38
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,090
are for the experiment Aaron loaned us 3

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,940
/ 16 s in

40
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:20,349
newly allocated given down from the iono

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:23,230
but not yet given two victims / aids

42
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:26,339
four of them actually and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

43
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:29,829
only experimented in two is my memory

44
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so how do we test the reefs ability</font>

45
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,830
first let's define some terminology

46
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:38,619
there's a test prefix though okay

47
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,410
there's an anchor prefix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a</font>

48
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:44,290
well-established prefix whose reach

49
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:46,540
ability should be fine it's been there

50
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,870
since nineteen forty eight it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,298
send and receive packets successfully

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:55,900
both of those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> announced from a test</font>

53
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:58,090
site in fact in both of these in all of

54
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,329
the tests they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> announced from the</font>

55
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:04,299
same machine behind the same routers at

56
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:07,810
the same site so the test prefix night

57
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:10,690
might be ninety six point zero point 1

58
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:15,370
point 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the anchor prefix might be</font>

59
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,170
147 28 0 35 someone says they're yeah in

60
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:22,060
fact those aren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> mike b's those are</font>

61
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:24,059
actual examples okay and so the probe

62
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:27,750
side is this rack at the westin

63
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:32,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-home site it's got a machine in it</font>

64
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,780
from both those prefixes connected to

65
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:39,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are two classes of</font>

66
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:41,260
probes we're going to do in probes those

67
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,980
are probes coming from out in the

68
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:49,269
internet being sent to both of those

69
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:53,500
prefixes the test and the anchor their

70
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:57,400
probes and their<font color="#CCCCCC"> trace routes okay for</font>

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:00,040
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> in probes there trace routes all the</font>

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:02,200
way so you can see here unfortunately

73
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,108
<font color="#CCCCCC">because there's to scream stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can't</font>

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:09,940
point very well this kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of works okay</font>

75
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:13,209
so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we expected both of</font>

76
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,940
them to go directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in fact due to</font>

77
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:19,389
this tooth off oh my god<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe it</font>

78
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:22,210
diverted this way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll go into some</font>

79
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:25,630
boring detail on this in a minute for

80
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">the out probes okay we go from the test</font>

81
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,650
site

82
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,039
to a whole mass of IP addresses out

83
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:37,210
there on the internet and if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> fails</font>

84
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:40,990
then we're going to do the traceroute ok

85
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:42,969
so the testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reach ability of a</font>

86
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,680
prefix in other words hey can we from

87
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,210
out here on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet reach that</font>

88
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,090
prefixes you've got the anchor in the

89
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,638
test IP and we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

90
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,609
propagated in the same way as<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

91
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,740
announced<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> location in</font>

92
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,370
other words i'm assuming that the

93
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,979
announcing probe<font color="#E5E5E5"> site the home site for</font>

94
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,919
both these prefixes is not doing a

95
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:08,349
different announcement policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> outwards</font>

96
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,318
of these two prefixes so that any

97
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:13,750
routing anomalies and the announcement

98
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:20,949
anomalies are caused by immediate

99
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:22,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">neighbors or the set of AAS is out there</font>

100
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the world it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

101
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:29,440
announcing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two of them differently</font>

102
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:33,009
ok so we assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and from each trace</font>

103
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:37,300
route server out in the internet we

104
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:41,949
trace route to the test IP and to the

105
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:45,190
anchor IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and you can see obviously</font>

106
00:05:41,949 --> 00:05:48,819
what would be expected and if you have a

107
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:51,130
blockage ie there's either a that

108
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:54,039
there's a route filter as opposed to a

109
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,169
packet filter you are either going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

110
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">die if there is no other way to get</font>

111
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:02,409
there or you will divert to another path

112
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,569
ok and for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the moment let's assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

113
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:09,310
the other path you divert to is less

114
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:12,759
optimal<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok how do we get these test</font>

115
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:14,139
sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok the in probes well I'll get</font>

116
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:16,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a minute I guess get to hear</font>

117
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:18,849
more first the in probes give reach

118
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,810
ability information towards the test and

119
00:06:18,849 --> 00:06:27,449
anchor prefix ok if it diverges we can

120
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:33,490
start to build a list of candidate a

121
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:36,550
esas who might filter ok and in fact

122
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:39,440
what we end up with is when we started

123
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,050
we want to try to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things at</font>

124
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,700
s granularity and we very quickly

125
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:53,420
learned that broken<font color="#CCCCCC"> bogan filter</font>

126
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:56,210
policies are not a s contiguous in other

127
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:58,460
words they're a SS that work partly and

128
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:03,380
don't work partly so we had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break</font>

129
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:05,810
things down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the router</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font>

130
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,820
problem with a in probes is they catch

131
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:09,860
only filters that are between<font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

132
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,290
traceroute servers or looking glasses

133
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,040
etc in the test site and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

134
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:17,390
find a limited number of these

135
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:19,100
traceroute servers out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

136
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,599
places from which we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can trace route</font>

137
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:27,890
we'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to trace the route from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

138
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:29,630
whole edge good luck<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and we can</font>

139
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">only find a limited number of filters</font>

140
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:35,570
because of this but at least it

141
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:39,580
identifies intermediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> AAS candidates</font>

142
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:43,400
that we would become suspicious of and

143
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:46,010
what we did let's get to the detail is

144
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,700
we advertise the<font color="#CCCCCC"> textin anchor prefixes</font>

145
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:52,460
from Iraq and the westin hair<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thorning</font>

146
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:55,849
did it from eunuch<font color="#CCCCCC"> Andy Linton did it</font>

147
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:59,450
from Wellington and Moz who's here did

149
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:07,099
networks are very disjoint we got 480

public traceroute servers and planetlab

152
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:18,289
there were something i forget a large

number of people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who volunteered when i</font>

put out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that posting saying please run</font>

155
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,010
this program that did the traceroute and

156
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:29,650
thing in hundreds volunteer from the

157
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:32,900
nanog posting so we categorized them

158
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,919
good the anchoring test prefix took

159
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:38,718
exactly the same path we went down the

160
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,409
walk and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't find anything</font>

161
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,070
blocking it sixty six point nine percent

162
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:48,980
let's call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it 70 just for giggles they</font>

163
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,600
diverged that the anchor in the test

164
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:56,160
prefix took

165
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:59,279
pads this says whoops somebody is not

166
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,920
propagating the test prefix so they took

167
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,380
a different path they found a less

168
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,300
optimal path in fact it might have been

169
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,579
less congested and be more optimal in

170
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,630
some sense but they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take the same</font>

171
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:16,469
path the test prefix stops but the

172
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:18,779
anchor is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay oops you can't get there</font>

173
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,540
from here there was some there were

174
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:23,069
either multiple cuts or there was only

175
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:26,610
one way to get there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that was cut</font>

176
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:29,399
and then either the<font color="#E5E5E5"> anchor neither the</font>

177
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:32,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">anchor nor the test prefix could get</font>

178
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:36,839
there and that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually four percent</font>

179
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:41,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay neither anchor or anchor and test</font>

180
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:46,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">feel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right ok so we derived the</font>

181
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:48,899
candidate links from multiples in other

182
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:50,339
words hey one got through from this way

183
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:53,579
one got through from that way oh it

184
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:56,370
wasn't him it was therefore she two hops

185
00:09:53,579 --> 00:09:58,050
further on is more likely and we get

186
00:09:56,370 --> 00:10:00,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">about 30 for a esas the contained</font>

187

188
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:06,389
will like verification and we've posted

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,060
that to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet deny dog list the</font>

00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,970
evaluation why we like in probes well

191
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:15,000
trace routes go around the bogan filters

192
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:18,779
if there's an alternate<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass they find a</font>

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,509

paths router by router the disadvantages

196
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:31,290
we must<font color="#E5E5E5"> find traceroute sites behind</font>

197
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:33,750
bogan filters and trace route sites and

198
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:36,599
people who read on the nanog list and

199
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,630
say gosh yes I'll volunteer to help run

200
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,529
your program for you and planetlab<font color="#CCCCCC"> nodes</font>

201
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:48,630
are not unbiased against distribution of

202
00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:51,779
clue so therefore these tights are more

203
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:54,959
likely to be good than the victims<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

204
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:58,110
poor<font color="#E5E5E5"> end users sitting behind people</font>

205
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,899
with less clue so these results are

206
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:03,750
probably optimistic but they give you a

207
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,700
technique at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

208
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,920
and there's never enough traceroute

209
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,770
sites because you really want the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire</font>

210
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,069
edge of the internet that large and is

211
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:16,920
rumored to be growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the goal</font>

212
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:20,160
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to test as many a SS as possible for</font>

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,069
reach ability we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know how well</font>

214
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,420
we're actually covering those edges so

215
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:30,120
the solution is out probes<font color="#CCCCCC"> our probe</font>

216
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:34,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">your ping and traceroute from the test</font>

218
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,329
interest that's what you really would

219
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:42,390
like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know can that site get to the</font>

220
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,660
test prefix but you can't test that so

221
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:48,650
what we learn is which a s is out there

222
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,990
have connectivity I can reach them<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

223
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:56,370
it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is good because it gives us</font>

we went to the test sites and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we went to</font>

230
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:22,920
all the a esas in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routing table</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

231
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:27,810
we went<font color="#E5E5E5"> and did scan pings to try and</font>

232
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:30,270
find a pinnacle scan pings from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a source</font>

233
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:33,599
address that we thought was good you

234
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">know an old anchor prefix 147 28</font>

235
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,020
whatever and we spray it out there

236
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:44,910
cautiously and tried to find within

237
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:51,120
every a.s.a pingable address we didn't

238
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:54,120
succeed but we got 18,000 odd a esas if

239
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,700
the ping comes back yes that can be

240
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">reached which was eighty-five percent of</font>

241
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:01,860
a s as we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach if a ping</font>

242
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:08,640
does not come back well the anchor<font color="#CCCCCC"> leaks</font>

243
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:11,970
says we don't know so approximately<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2500</font>

244
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,370
de esas we depending upon which probe

245
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,050
site we were coming from we couldn't

246
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:21,180
find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> pingable there</font>

247
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:24,479
now we did get email back from large

248
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,979
corporations that announced 24 and

249
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,480
that's about it and they said why are

250
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:32,519
you scanning or / 24 and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

251
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,829
they've got is a firewall they're using

252
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,870
two addresses in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> flash 24 and the</font>

253
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:38,969
rest of them are used for detecting evil

254
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,790
people like researchers and sending them

255
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,769
nasty email and so we responded in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

256
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:52,860
usual way and<font color="#CCCCCC"> told them that sorry about</font>

257
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:56,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we do notice it was a ping so we</font>

258
00:13:52,860 --> 00:14:01,260
built a filtering likelihood index based

259
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:03,859
on proximity and observations / a s if

260
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:10,620
we had multiple pingable<font color="#CCCCCC"> xin the a s</font>

261
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:14,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and we said come this is a the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CDF</font>

262
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a s vs. link in other words how much</font>

263
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:25,350
better information do we get if we look

264
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:30,360
at links or a esas<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's significant</font>

265
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:33,810
in some of the ranges<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

266
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:38,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">i'll finish in 10 minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we drive 443</font>

267
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:43,020
candidate a SS that are likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to filter</font>

268
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,100
we then did a manual search for 15 try

269
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:51,600
and found 15 trace route servers within

270
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:56,070
those a SS seven of them clearly

271
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,339
filtered<font color="#CCCCCC"> five did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not filter themselves</font>

272
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:01,079
but their upstream or side stream or

273
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:06,449
whatever in other words their way to get

274
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:08,729
towards us was the culprit so now you're

275
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:11,910
at twelve<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifteen eighty percent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

276
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,740
correctly identified three failed but

277
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we suspect some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

278
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:20,130
might be that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> went and did</font>

279
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:22,949
this part of the validation after the

280
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,930
measurements were taken and you know

281
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:26,640
there was only so long<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron was holding</font>

282
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,099
on to that space and hope so long before

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">people propagated their fixes etc we</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

285
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:38,080
we do intend to do this again<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so our</font>

286
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:42,070
probe told us about reach ability can we

287
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,260
get there but and where you can get to

288
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:46,330
and where you can't get to they have

289
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:48,790
much better coverage but they don't

290
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:51,100
really tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> us about the return path non</font>

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,650
optimal paths and where the diversion is

happening whereas in probes tell us

293
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:59,730
about filters on the path available

294
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:02,230
reach ability much smaller coverage

295
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:07,510
would love more traceroute servers

296
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:10,210
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so we have the scent list of</font>

297
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:12,610
suspected bogan filter rings out there

298
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:16,030
and we've gotten some feedback and<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep</font>

299
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:18,760
people said oh sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and we</font>

300
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:21,400
said thank you we have an increasing

words sites from which the traceroute so

304
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:33,400
we can detect better how<font color="#E5E5E5"> accurate can we</font>

305
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:35,500
be there are some parameters we could

306
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,730
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many test sites we have</font>

307
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently we have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> four where the next</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cycle of this research we I of course</font>

309
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">came into this from the opposite</font>

310

operational angle and my co-workers came

311
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,410
in from the academic angle and so the

312
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,120
paper is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be in Kyoto at the</font>

313
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,100
sitcom conference and then they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

314
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,690
happy and we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work on actually</font>

315
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,650
deploying operationally so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

316
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:05,260
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> working with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a registrar</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> written</font>

317
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:06,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">IRR IRS for actual deployment so the</font>

318
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">question is how many probes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Heights</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

319
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:11,050
we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to put out there to be</font>

320
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:14,649
usable if we put<font color="#CCCCCC"> five is there a</font>

321
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:18,399
significant gain over three okay how do

322
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:20,980
we do we quantify that accuracy how do

323
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,450
you say how accurate this is now we're

324
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,030
down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router level are we down to</font>

325
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:27,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the AAS level um will we settle for</font>

326
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,990
twenty percent error<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's people writing</font>

327
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:32,430
back and said you said I was broken

328
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:35,380
balloon<font color="#CCCCCC"> good I don't know good questions</font>

329
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:39,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay from the out probes we can identify</font>

330
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:42,010
unreachable places<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and aside from</font>

331
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:43,168
small issues related to ICMP and whether

332
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:47,609
it's propagated

333
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:50,159
and whether UD<font color="#CCCCCC"> pping vs ICMP paintable</font>

334
00:17:47,609 --> 00:17:51,509
theta we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if the probe doesn't</font>

335
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:53,879
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they don't have</font>

336
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,470
connectivity for us that's real simple

337
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:58,799
and straightforward but it doesn't tell

338
00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:03,299
us exactly where the problem was<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

339
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:04,980
now if we have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> AAS map or then you</font>

340
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,440
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get a true a.s map but if we</font>

341
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,269
have a partial is map we can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

342
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,669
making conjecture about where it's

343
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:14,249
broken between us but it's possible to

344
00:18:11,669 --> 00:18:16,289
get good coverage without probes because

345
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:18,869
you can ping towards the edge it

346
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:20,850
produces some usable results the in

347
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:25,289
probes we can do further and actually

348
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:27,029
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really pinpoint okay but we</font>

349
00:18:25,289 --> 00:18:30,509
mainly look at trace routes that brief

350
00:18:27,029 --> 00:18:33,059
both the destination addresses and of

351
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:36,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">course there's the problem of how many</font>

352
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:39,509
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are out there okay we've trying to</font>

353
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:41,039
get work with registries I'm to fund an

354
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:42,690
ongoing service they're not funded but

355
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,269
we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this for a living</font>

356
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,480
but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> too we're helping them establish</font>

357
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:52,259
it we need more pingable addresses we

358
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,659
need more<font color="#E5E5E5"> traceroute servers etc Aaron</font>

359
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:59,940
gave us the IP space they commissioned

360
00:18:54,659 --> 00:19:02,639
the research etc etc um as one of their

361
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,889
chunks of ongoing research with which we

362
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:10,889
participate citylink in New Zealand and

365
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:26,340
people paid some money questions whoo

366
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:28,850
can you get away free come on Wow Thank
