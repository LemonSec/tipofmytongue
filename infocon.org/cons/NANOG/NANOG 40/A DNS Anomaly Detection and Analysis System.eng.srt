on the variation ratio of DNS traffic

221
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:08,769
will explain two cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> of utilizing the</font>

222
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:12,739
system the first one is to detect

unexpected to<font color="#CCCCCC"> increased on MX queries in</font>

224
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:22,160
Beverly 2007 at the time the traffic was

225
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:25,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">doubled in response ratio logisys to ten</font>

226
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,779
percent were higher in means both top

227
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:34,010
client queries are drunk we investigate

228
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:38,329
what caused their who generate what qui

229
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:41,269
type there we can announce this result

230
00:16:38,329 --> 00:16:44,479
that multiple source IP addresses from

231
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:47,449
many server farms kept generating MX

232
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,510
queries it was a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> berwyn</font>

233
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:54,079
situation we block the traffic from the

00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:57,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">corner to the infecting system actually</font>

235
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,729
it's in USA

236
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:05,690
the second case is to detect tons of

237
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:10,940
corazon time that is to that GOP in

238

we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had multiple presentations over</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">be very interesting and see some more</font>

cashing name service like what you have

put together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

from amazon have you been doing any

272
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,910
anomaly detection in the time domain or

273
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,710
has it<font color="#E5E5E5"> been primarily based on query</font>

274
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:20,110
type and response types are you actually

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:25,590
doing time to time domain analysis<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

276
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:25,590
you know response times actually

285
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:09,780
that was a why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you take the approach</font>

286
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,879
of deploying a server based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> tabs or a</font>

collector picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up off the tap as</font>

288
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:20,680
opposed to a local agent on the name

289
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:25,840
server um because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have so many DNS</font>

290
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:28,810
servers there is no tab can you store
