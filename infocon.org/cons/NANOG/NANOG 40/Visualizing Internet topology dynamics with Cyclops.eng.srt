00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:08,340
hi my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ricardo leave a dime from</font>

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:12,059
UCLA and this is joint work with all

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,590
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> people here and I'm going to be</font>

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,000
talking about this tool that have been

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:19,980
developed being recently that tries to

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,689
visualized internet topology dynamics

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:27,480
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cyclops so why visualizing</font>

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:29,910
topology dynamics in first place this

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,930
was a message I cut in<font color="#CCCCCC"> nanak a couple of</font>

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:38,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">weeks ago someone asking if there was</font>

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:42,600
some tool around to to evaluate some isp

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:44,760
for a possible connection and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this this guy got any any answers</font>

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,949
actually but when when approached to

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:52,050
answer this person is to look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,079
connectivity of ISPs change over time

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,419
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> instance if ISPs are in losing</font>

18
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:00,809
customers are getting customers on the

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">recent past so if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

20
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,798
knowledge we can help in make

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,840
intelligent choices about connectivity

22
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,260
so what exactly are we interesting

23
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,170
visualize basically want to visualize

24
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,830
changes in topology so nodes and links

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:24,720
and we are interested in capturing where

26
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:28,080
and when these changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen one of the</font>

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">challenges we faced with scaling the</font>

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet is a very big system it has</font>

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,939
thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes and thousands of</font>

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:41,729
links so we need to find<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

31
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:44,699
visually capture these changes and so

32
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,679
that a human can read it so the first

33
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,159
approach we took is to start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,270
single node and show the connectivity of

35
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:59,280
this node to the neighbors and display

36
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:02,429
the connectivity changes over time so

37
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,009
the data we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this these are</font>

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,469
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is public data so we use BGP</font>

39
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,960
routing tables and updates from<font color="#E5E5E5"> ralphs</font>

40
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:14,370
is right we also use route servers echh

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:16,450
in other sources looking glasses and

42
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,250
basically the point is the more data we

43
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,609
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the better because we get more</font>

44
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:24,040
complete<font color="#CCCCCC"> topologies and we can see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

45
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">more things going on in the network so</font>

46
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,690
if you have a field that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to let</font>

47
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,670
this publicly available in one share

48
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:35,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">with us please contact me after talk so</font>

49
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,890
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a snapshot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tool we have</font>

50
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:42,880
this use user interface so basically

51
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:44,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">here we have a central node 701 AT&T the</font>

52
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,790
blue note in the middle and we are

53
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,420
visualizing changes from early January

54
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:55,090
so you have a timeline on the left

55
00:02:51,420 --> 00:03:00,790
bottom corner from January first two

56
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:04,450
about in January 24th and so here we see

57
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:09,790
a bunch of red link red links these red

58
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:12,010
links are deep earrings the the red

59
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,440
nodes are notes that disappear from

60
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:19,149
topology<font color="#CCCCCC"> the green nodes are notes that</font>

61
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:21,670
appear so new nodes and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thickness of</font>

62
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:24,610
each link in this case is proportional

63
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:29,109
to the age<font color="#E5E5E5"> of link so the secret link</font>

64
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:30,970
the older it is on the right side on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

65
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:35,970
bottom we have a bunch of filters that

66
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:38,680
we can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the to make the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

67
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:44,620
picture more readable so we can only

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:50,130
show thats or persons one these are case

69
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:52,000
study we extracted so this represents

70
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,920
the bunch of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> appearance that</font>

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,370
happening in<font color="#E5E5E5"> April thousand seven in</font>

72
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,850
cogent so this was reported there are

73
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,860
several blogs online about<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

74
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:08,049
appearance we verify some of these yeses

75
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:11,650
and they match and the point is this

76
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:16,570
tool enables us to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the these</font>

77
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:20,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes happen over time this is another</font>

78
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:23,380
example and here i didn't put hypothec

79
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">swazi because some of</font>

80
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,140
I see I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> some badges from these</font>

81
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:32,229
operators around and but if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

82
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:35,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what what is XYZ just you can come</font>

83
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:40,240
to me after talk but anyway so in this

84
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:42,430
case we expanded the neighbors of X and

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,820
so we are seeing changes two hops away

86
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:47,790
from eggs and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from</font>

87
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:50,800
previous picture because now the the

88
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">thickness of each link is proportional</font>

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,520
to the number of routes carried in each

90
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:02,740
link and the numbers there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are th so we</font>

91
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:05,979
see two big d parents connecting at y

92
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:08,290
and z and the interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing here is</font>

93
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,330
that we can relate these deep earrings

94
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:18,880
to other deep earrings that happen for

95
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:20,500
instance in Y here you see a bunch of

96
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,250
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> appearance opening around the same</font>

97
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:27,850
time so most likely these<font color="#CCCCCC"> d parents were</font>

98
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:34,510
initiated by Y and in Z the same the

99
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:37,720
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing so your input is most</font>

100
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:40,240
appreciated that's the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here</font>

101
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,160
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any feedback if you want to</font>

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,620
see some new features<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this tool if</font>

103
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,260
you think this tool is useful for you as

104
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,630
an operator or if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like any</font>

105
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,280
feature in this tool or if you think

106
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,920
they're things that might not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be so</font>

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,049
useful so contact me afterwards I'll be

108
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,090
around I can do some demos if you want

109
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,170
and we are planning on a better release

110
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:06,280
of the tool by September 2007 and i

111
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,750
think that's it so many questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> washes</font>

112
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,380
out there we have time for one or two if

113
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,380
you want to quick

114
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:16,710
now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned that it takes feet</font>

115
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:20,469
from like our servers and so forth but

116
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:22,690
can you feed it directly like data from

117
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:27,610
say something that will export an mrt

118
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:29,530
format we use the date so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use the</font>

119
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">logs that are available in route views</font>

120
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:33,369
all right for instance so we don't

121
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,509
directly puree them we<font color="#E5E5E5"> just use the data</font>

122
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,490
they have available thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

123
00:06:34,509 --> 00:06:41,319
preserve<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I dumped an mrt</font>

124
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:45,099
formatted file into it from my own route

125
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:47,830
collector from your own rock collector

126
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:49,780
sure I mean you can if you use mrt

127
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:53,008
formats oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

128
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:53,008
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask yes yes</font>
