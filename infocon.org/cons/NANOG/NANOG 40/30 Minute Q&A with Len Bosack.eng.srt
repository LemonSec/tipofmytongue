00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:10,980
okay let me give you a little background

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:15,389
on internets first and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp came to be in a cafeteria</font>

to this day first off<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet's happen</font>

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,820
when you connect networks with routers

non internet solutions are not offensive

16
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,218
if there's an engineering reason for

17
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,470
them so one thing that troubles me

18
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:09,630
nowadays is that we see the IP panacea

19
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:13,170
everything over IP is no more right than

20
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,548
no IP robust engineered systems have

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,869
for example by this is the belief that

24
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:27,899
mobility should be done only as an

of in my mind relatively limited choices

there's much more possible that we

88
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:26,289
because we perceived a crisis with the

way EGP a protocol

91
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,280
worth looking at because it it it's a

distributions back from the centralizers

96
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,530
and it's it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> no boy no there's no</font>

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:49,920
there's no future there vgp was intended

is to produce a protocol that was

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,670
reasonably scalable and had the

properties our idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a path property</font>

would<font color="#E5E5E5"> include say how much bandwidth you</font>

hitless well yeah that's what we had

hoped would happen unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

that I

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,669
get there in terms of quality quantity

138
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:50,240
or other choices that in my view<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

139
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:54,349
wrong having a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp decision procedure</font>

140
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,740
that sensors everything about what goes

141
00:06:54,349 --> 00:07:00,159
on is an information hiding exercise

142
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:03,020
that is no longer beneficial when

143
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:05,810
computation and memory were so very

144
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:08,599
expensive that might have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a</font>

145
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,509
sensible approach but now with a

146
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:14,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">reasonable exertion of computer science</font>

147
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:15,919
and it's not no exertion trust me it's

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,990
not no exertion but with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasonable</font>

149
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,849
exertion of computer science you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

150
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:23,659
actually take this information

151
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:27,110
transmitted it with reasonable

152
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:29,599
efficiency and then do very useful

153
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:33,319
things with the greater amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

154
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:36,680
information that you get so the approach

155
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,690
of take everything in run a single

156
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,289
decision procedure produce a single

157
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:45,530
answer and hide all the rest is just in

158
00:07:42,289 --> 00:07:47,240
a word wrong and finally I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

159
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,940
have perceived it to be not only wrong

160
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,380
but less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than completely useful so</font>

161
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,639
perhaps we're going to get some changes

162
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:57,349
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm all for it the gentleman</font>

163
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,750
for example in catholic university would

164
00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:01,460
have had a much easier time of it if he

165
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,310
had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of second hop</font>

166
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:08,719
information and some quality information

167
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:12,919
that came along<font color="#E5E5E5"> with it no excuse to not</font>

168
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:14,990
do that nowadays so there's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

169
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,090
of introduction Oh bgp though and the

170
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,669
way it actually started in in part is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

171
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:22,119
had to get to very clever but very

172
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:25,818
hard-headed folks to agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were</font>

173
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,120
carlo he'd at cisco and<font color="#CCCCCC"> jakub rector</font>

174
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:32,719
then probably with IBM<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yorktown Heights</font>

175
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm not sure TJ</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> watson I think and those</font>

176
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,640
are if you those of you know them know

177
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,919
that they're both both they're both

178
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,500
quite capable but they have the ability

179
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:46,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have strong opinions</font>

180
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:49,530
I see some of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have met them okay</font>

181
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,760
and nothing wrong with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

182
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,709
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with having a personality</font>

183
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">and having opinion so long as you're</font>

184
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,210
willing to listen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what other people</font>

185
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:59,700
have to say on the subject and I could

186
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:01,830
eventually get them to agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

187
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,110
path information approach was something

188
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:10,140
that was viable and that we should give

189
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:12,570
it a<font color="#CCCCCC"> try now why TCP well all the other</font>

190
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,900
protocols that were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing routing at</font>

191
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:18,600
that time had some sort of error control

192
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,910
mechanism and generically the approach

193
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,340
that most is most commonly taken comes

194
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:26,360
from the communications world called a

195
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:30,590
RQ which essentially is acknowledged and

196
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,210
reentry we transmit on error

197
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:37,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-wrought why reinvent it let's just</font>

198
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">use TCP and get on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it now whether</font>

199
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:41,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">you had to run it over IP or not was it</font>

200
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:43,920
actually a separable question tcp works

201
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,900
just fine without IP you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

202
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,280
there's a few issues to overcome you if

203
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,430
they do a different slightly different

204
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,800
check some pseudo header but there's

205
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:55,500
nothing wrong with TCP without IP if you

206
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,439
just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run point-to-point still</font>

207
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,600
rather than reinvent this I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought</font>

208
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,089
we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as well agree that we</font>

209
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,470
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> use a mechanism</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we had sure</font>

210
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:10,830
it has various flaws but it would get

211
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,570
our particular problem solved in a year

212
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:15,780
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about when we we needed it</font>

213
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:17,700
solved and it did so that's where that

214
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,000
came from getting these two<font color="#E5E5E5"> fellows to</font>

215
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:23,220
agree on just about anything was I

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,730
regarded quite an achievement ultimately

217
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,030
achieved in an extended delay of lunch

218
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,250
in the Austin cafeteria then micro

219
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,920
component micro electronics and

220
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,310
component consortium I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

221
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,770
what it was called and we did get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

222
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,739
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> Britain and you're using at</font>

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:49,830
comment perhaps in a more limited way

225
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,600
than I<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoped I have other things i can</font>

talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but why don't I try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

227
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,440
answer some people's questions anyone

228
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,180
want to know either ancient history

current<font color="#E5E5E5"> history theory</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I can tell you a lot about the physics</font>

231
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,520
of optical fiber transmission I think I

232
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:09,470
could probably borrow a lot of you so

233
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:13,110
with that threat I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question about</font>

234
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:15,150
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the lack of adoption or</font>

237
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:24,510
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it may have come about due</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

238
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,340
the fact that people were reluctant to

239
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:28,710
expose that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> about their</font>

240
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,580
network to their neighbors there's a

241
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:40,010
commercial issue for<font color="#CCCCCC"> some folks and I</font>

242
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:42,410
hope that's going to fall away you can

243
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,880
well you can always lie<font color="#E5E5E5"> first off</font>

244
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:47,939
there's nothing no reason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

245
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,750
someone wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> they couldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just say</font>

246
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:55,050
as much as you care to send and that

247
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,570
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer but not a very useful</font>

248
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,280
answer clearly the recipient of such a

00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing essentially treats that as no</font>

250
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,329

253
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:12,930
that a little bit myself routing on the

254
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,240
basis of other than topology is a little

255
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:17,040
bit tricky especially if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">change in real time the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole subject of</font>

257
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,819
what's called flow variation routing

258
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,240
where you actually dynamically vary your

259
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,280
path choices with the traffic conditions

260
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:28,770
is quite a challenge to maintain

261
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,350
stability over a large area it requires

262
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:33,870
either reasonable assurance that

263
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:36,120
everyone's making decisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> on similar</font>

264
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:39,330
information or a centralized<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision</font>

265
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">maker probably not the right answer so</font>

266
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:43,890
yeah there's a commercial problem with

267
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:47,790
disclosing some bandwidth aspects but

268
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:52,199
I'd also<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to believe that nowadays</font>

269
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:54,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">there is quite a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of commercial</font>

270
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:59,220
understanding of each other's networks

271
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:02,819
it's not easy to hide if someone cares

272
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,990
to look thank you so yeah there's a

273
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,430
commercial issue but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

274
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,580
technical issues will eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> trump</font>

275
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,579
that

276
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,160
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lenny I think the future of the</font>

277
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:14,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very mobility</font>

278
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,550
based it's a huge market there's a lot

279
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:19,939
of players that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are involved have any</font>

280
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:21,740
words of wisdom on how to scale mobility

281
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,480
because it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very tough problem the</font>

282
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:26,450
people in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> only know how to</font>

283
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,810
scale it by doing stuff at l-3 do you

284
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:31,250
think there's other paradigms where you

285
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:33,349
can get mobility to work you know

286
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:35,600
handsets on<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-speed trains and planes</font>

287
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:39,920
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mobile networks and sort of</font>

288
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing any thoughts sure I I think that</font>

289
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,400
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a great pity to try and have</font>

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:48,350
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> level three only solution for mobility</font>

291

300
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,640
can't keep a phone call up over many

and accept the commercially acceptable

the level 3<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of that is the least</font>

319
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,900
important part of mobility and that the

320
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:09,110
most important part is to be able to

321
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:12,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">have effective regional mobility if you</font>

322
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,589
could drive from let's say Washington DC

323
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:17,780
to New York and keep your phone calls up

324
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,940
isn't that the practical answer for

325
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:23,939
perfection do you really care to be

326
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,800
able to fly across<font color="#CCCCCC"> Baffin Island</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on your</font>

327
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,220
way to Iceland and keep your phone call

328
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,810
up is that so important well the

329
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,530
transmission technology doesn't permit

330
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:36,719
you so level 3 roaming in my view is

331
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">very important for very high speeds in</font>

332
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,730
very long distances<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not so important</font>

333
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:47,430
for the distances and speeds that people

334
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:48,990
actually care about so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pity to have only a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually spent on you know a fair amount</font>

339
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:11,630
of time discussing the utility of

340
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:15,710
jacking up bgp or IP and putting in a

341
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:18,689
location layer that exists outside of IP

342
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:24,570
would you care to comment on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and um</font>

343
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:32,010
I guess potentially on what you see the

344
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:36,050
future for bgp as again there's nothing

345
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:38,760
intrinsically wrong with non internet

346
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:42,329

00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:52,859
dwells where he always<font color="#E5E5E5"> dwells and that</font>

350
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:58,970
is in the details how it's done how its

351
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:01,070
represented and to what extent

352
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,410
information can be substituted

353
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:06,810
aggregated and even hidden are crucial

354
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,079
decisions at a very high level that have

355
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:14,399
to be made for these things part of the

356
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:17,060
reason that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people do first look</font>

357
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,829
to IP nowadays is those issues are

358
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,319
pretty well<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolved and you don't have</font>

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:26,188
to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them and engineer them</font>

360
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,040
anew whereas i would guess that the

00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:32,490
proposals that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> described of that</font>

362

slowly

364
00:17:33,929 --> 00:17:43,169
and those conceptual barriers are some

365
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:44,970
of the reasons for that lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of speed so</font>

to be robust in the presence of

balls with microwave connectors and it

400
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,090
was our fervent hope that this would not

too long

403
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:46,600
so there's the problem it's getting

404
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:50,399
power in getting heat out and getting

405

your signals in and out with any

00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:57,699
communication technology that depends on

416

whenever that whenever the marketing men

417
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:27,369
were there so they got QuarkXPress out

418

and they pulled in their data sheet and

419
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:31,749
they edited it up they fixed a few of

420
00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:36,039
their typos and then they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lunch</font>

421
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:37,899
and they were done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the boys in</font>

422
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:39,249
the labs you know cursed a little bit

all right let's go change the clock<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

425
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:44,590
this and they were real scared of that

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,600
600 megabit stuff so they did<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

careful board layout job and the ORF

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,248
stuff was very carefully done and so

429
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:54,249
they changed the clock and it almost

430
00:20:51,249 --> 00:20:55,570
worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> it two and a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> half and you know</font>

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,549
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years go by I guess it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets to be</font>

435
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:08,049
2001 maybe 2002 and it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font>

436
00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:11,049
the promises again so the marketing guys

437
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:13,480
get QuarkXPress out and they pull in the

438
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:14,710
old<font color="#CCCCCC"> datasheet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they edit it up and do</font>

439
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,809
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing and then they go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to lunch</font>

440
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,389
and they're done there was any

441
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:22,299
difference as far as they were concerned

442
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:23,678
now the boys in the lab a few of the

443
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:24,999
older<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones said you know fellas this is</font>

444
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,129
going to about to get hard you now have

445
00:21:24,999 --> 00:21:29,109
a carrier that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we used to call X</font>

00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:31,539

<font color="#CCCCCC">the stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then we're going</font>

449
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:42,340
to give it a try and it didn't work and

450
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:45,009
it didn't work<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next year so right</font>

451
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:47,080
now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the circumstance where we'd</font>

452
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:49,600
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to write a p.o for you know five</font>

455
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:59,030
and no one will deliver them this year

456
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,830
so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> those folks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who were up here</font>

457
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:03,280
telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> you how readily available it all</font>

458
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,960
was let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me give you a reality check when</font>

459
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:10,639
you come to go to when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come to write</font>

460
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:15,670
a check it isn't quite so easy and the

461
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,960
40 gig stuff well everyone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand tuned</font>

462
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:19,880
you want to buy a thousand before the

463
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:22,040
end of this year I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can</font>

464
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,160
you want to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> commissioned before</font>

465
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:28,070
the end of this year I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it unlikely</font>

466
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:31,130
so I'm optimistic about making it all go

467
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,169
faster that's sort of maybe not what you

468
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,630
would conclude<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I have to tell you</font>

469
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:38,150
the pace is going to be a bit slower and

470
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,250
the costs are not going to be what you

471
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,570
would hope for so yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we're</font>

472
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:43,730
going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it go faster I think we're</font>

473
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:49,460
going to get 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig single streams down</font>

474
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:51,200
fiber but not this decade so I'm

475
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:53,150
optimistic but not perhaps the way that

476
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,480
other people think I think we're getting

477

near the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our time let's do Tony</font>

479
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:03,110
okay go ahead Johnny hang Jonny well I

00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,330
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with your earlier point about you</font>

that is available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me because it's</font>

491
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,530
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some pieces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this that we</font>

is probably best handled within the

all the people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network plus those</font>

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:49,860
seem to be in my limited view a good

another kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of tangent here to the</font>

everywhere every router does the same or

549
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:01,260
very similar work it's what I'm asking

550
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,059
is what do you see what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

551
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:10,590
about when someone says centralized

552
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:12,840
control plane I see danger when I worked

553
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:15,090
for bail we were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> conscious that the</font>

554
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,399
phone network that we'd built had the

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:20,928
unattractive property that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:22,820

exponentially decreasing function of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">centralized solutions and so our</font>

solution that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know was to produce</font>

561
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,049
components that were supremely reliable

562
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,610
and thus you got no rhodium over gold

563
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:43,549
plating on contacts and things of that

564
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:45,469
sort just conceptually there's the

565
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:49,220
possibility of producing a robust

566

of human nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> and disagreement</font>

the robustness<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a fully distributed</font>

gives you robustness is very important

573
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:16,070
and it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to engineer the agreements</font>

574
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:17,809
