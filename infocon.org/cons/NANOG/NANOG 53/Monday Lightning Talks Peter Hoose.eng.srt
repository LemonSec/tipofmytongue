1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,410
otherwise known as a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineer</font>

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,270
and today I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit</font>

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,640
about monitoring and troubleshooting in

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:14,620
a large-scale network like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook's so</font>

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:16,270
first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know why am I talking</font>

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:18,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this what is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that I'm</font>

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,869
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve and you might find</font>

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself saying you know packets are</font>

9
00:00:19,869 --> 00:00:22,690
getting there there's no problem on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

10
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:24,010
network when<font color="#E5E5E5"> something goes wrong all</font>

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,500
the blinking lights turn red you know

12
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:27,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything's good right well that's the</font>

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,020
case your network probably looks

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,850
something like this you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

15
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,860
servers you have some switches you have

16
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,870
a core of course it's all connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

17
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,790
series of tubes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and of</font>

18
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:38,320
course then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some monitoring</font>

19
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,970
system you have a syslog server reach

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,950
ability server<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphing so ever whatever</font>

21
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so if your network looks like this</font>

22
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,309
you're troubleshooting procedure

23
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,050
probably looks something like this a guy

24
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:48,640
calls and says hey I got some you know

25
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,500
packet loss on the network first thing

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do is confirm the issue you ping the</font>

27
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">servers you see that there's packet loss</font>

28
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:56,199
great now where's the packet loss

29
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,820
occurring well you run<font color="#E5E5E5"> traceroute run</font>

30
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,950
this traceroute you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's a hop</font>

31
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:01,300
three of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this path there's you know some</font>

32
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:02,980
problems occurring so you logged me this

33
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:05,500
device you run show interface you run

34
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,970
show<font color="#E5E5E5"> log shut down some random ports all</font>

35
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,679
else fails you call your vendor and you

36
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,569
say help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me out I don't know what's</font>

37
00:01:08,679 --> 00:01:12,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">wrong if that's what trouble shooting</font>

38
00:01:10,569 --> 00:01:14,979
procedure you're right that is easy

39
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:17,470
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done but and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big but</font>

40
00:01:14,979 --> 00:01:19,959
that's not my network<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the chances</font>

41
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:21,910
are it's probably not yours either my

42
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,380
network looks something like this I have

43
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,300
a lot of servers I have a lot of

44
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,220
aggregation layer and have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very large</font>

45
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,560
score later but in addition you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I'm</font>

46
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,700
a I'm a very large content provider so

47
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,229
I've also got an edge layer and a

48
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,700
backbone later and of course if I have a

49
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:35,500
backbone this means i have data centers

50
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">five data centers for redundancy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

51
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably have regions and of course this</font>

52
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:42,399
is all connected to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet by a</font>

53
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:44,800
series of tubes so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the part i'm</font>

54
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,240
very happy as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see here i wrote a</font>

55
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,470
perl script last night to show every

56
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,940
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter connection on our network</font>

57
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:53,319
in real time right now it's continuous

58
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,509
that's it that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly what the path</font>

59
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:57,039
looks like in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> network now of course</font>

60
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:58,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">any large steel network is never</font>

61
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,440
complete without its requisite set of

62
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:04,119
lions tigers and bears okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

63
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,530
exaggerating slightly we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

64
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,258
<font color="#CCCCCC">lions internetwork put the bears and</font>

65
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">tigers are real so let's talk about</font>

66
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:11,470
troubleshooting in this scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

67
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">first off you need to confirm the issue</font>

68
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,430
you run ping a game but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that doesn't</font>

69
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:16,900
really work<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using ecmp and</font>

70
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,680
wag a ping is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to follow the</font>

71
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,930
same path

72
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright let's run trace rack same</font>

73
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem packets not necessarily going to</font>

74
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">follow the same path that your data is</font>

75
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,989
falling so this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm starting to</font>

76
00:02:24,849 --> 00:02:28,090
freak out and the guy on the other end

77
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:29,469
of IRC thinks I'm an idiot so I start

78
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,849
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> show went on routers I start</font>

79
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,739
running show log I start shutting down

80
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:33,969
random ports but honestly I don't know

81
00:02:32,739 --> 00:02:35,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">which point I don't even know where my</font>

82
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,858
packets are I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know whether they're</font>

83
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,599
alive or dead so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the price that</font>

84
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:42,340
comes up it must be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> network issue</font>

85
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,280
right how many times<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

86
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> least 100</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably today and the</font>

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">reality is like can you really blame</font>

88
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,780
them because they don't really know any

89
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,189
better than you and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really know</font>

90
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:53,019
half the time if it is a network<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue</font>

91
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,370
the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes up says there's something</font>

92
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,900
wrong and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm like nah dude it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

93
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:57,909
network issue you know everything's cool

94
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:59,919
but let me check a few things and

95
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:02,950
reality is I find out later it is a

96
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:04,540
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue fair enough it's broken so</font>

97
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,369
what can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do about it well I've been</font>

98
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,078
thinking about this for all of maybe six

99
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,310
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> now and you know every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> day I go</font>

100
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:10,780
to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and troubleshoot another issue</font>

101
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,340
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I try to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out what i can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

102
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,069
solve this<font color="#E5E5E5"> so some of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

103
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:16,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with something better to trace</font>

104
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,040
the flow of packets in our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

105
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:19,409
looked at a nice day our presentation

106
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,459
from a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back called tres4</font>

107
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,228
essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's trash out but it gives</font>

108
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:24,790
you the full path all the way end-to-end

109
00:03:23,229 --> 00:03:26,680
including all the physical interfaces

110
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,900
inside of a bundle that a packet is

111
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,329
going to fall in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to do that you</font>

112
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,040
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> the full tuple that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

113
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:35,889
actually looking for what I mean is the

114
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,198
source IP destination IP source port

115
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:40,120
destination ploy to get that you run H

116
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,560
ping let it run<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will go across a</font>

117
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,629
series of source ports and then you can

118
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,220
find out which ones that great now I

119
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:46,959
know what's failing<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I can run a</font>

120
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,699
trace go and figure out where it failed

121
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,349
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition to that we need something</font>

122
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:52,030
real time to monitor this all the time

123
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:54,069
why not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just have all the hosts and all</font>

124
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,629
the routers run H ping constantly when

125
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,578
they detect a problem send out a trace

126
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:59,078
flow send me some syslog back saying

127
00:03:57,579 --> 00:04:01,329
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting you know packet loss at</font>

128
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,579
this point that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be awesome in</font>

129
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,560
addition BFD BFD is really cool it's

130
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,579
starting to get some port you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

131
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">the different vendors and different</font>

132
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,720
protocols but we'd also like to see it /

133
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:13,479
interface and a lag bundle once you get

134
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,370
that super awesome next more granular

135
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:18,669
counters<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30-second counters were not</font>

136
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,870
cool in 1999 they're not cool now I need

137
00:04:18,668 --> 00:04:21,399
better than that you know half my

138
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,259
problems come and go<font color="#CCCCCC"> inside of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30</font>

139
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:24,820
seconds I spent all the last weekend

140
00:04:23,259 --> 00:04:27,000
working on an issue that lasted for one

141
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,240
to two seconds at a time it was horrible

142
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,250
next I want to pull more you

143
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,569
I hear quite often you know I'm working

144
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">on an issue and I finally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to the</font>

145
00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:35,720
point where I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call the tac and</font>

146
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,280
he you know ask for output from a whole

147
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,840
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different commands and in the</font>

148
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,130
end I say cool like let's draft this

149
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,900
let's add this to our grapher and I

150
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:44,030
finally realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not an SNMP</font>

151
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,919
it's not an XML I can't get this data

152
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:47,960
out of the router that's not fun I

153
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,580
understand conceptually why that is but

154
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,349
it's not cool and I can't graph it

155
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,780
that's a problem which brings me to my

156
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:54,979
next point I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull it less and I</font>

157
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,719
know that's counterintuitive because I

158
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,639
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said I want to pull more but what I</font>

159
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,440
mean is when we hit a critical issue I

160
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,729
don't want to pull the router I don't

161
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,229
want to wait five minutes I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the</font>

162
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:05,090
router to send out a packet and tell me

163
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:06,560
something is wrong I've run into a

164
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,690
critical issue you need to do something

165
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,220
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> why do I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that well</font>

166
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,199
there's one engineer at Facebook once

167
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,030
put it today when we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for a</font>

168
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,740
problem we go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router and say hey</font>

169
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:18,049
router how you doing he's like pro I'm

170
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,849
doing great but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> routers insane he</font>

171
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,409
doesn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what he's talking about we</font>

172
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:23,150
need to test through the device we need

173
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:24,949
to test to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

174
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,049
ignore what it's saying and prove what's

175
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,819
going on lastly and this one's really

176
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,949
important to me in facebook in general

177
00:05:28,819 --> 00:05:32,539
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me pop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the hood let me get in that</font>

178
00:05:30,949 --> 00:05:34,130
router and let me run pearl on it let me

179
00:05:32,539 --> 00:05:36,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> python on it let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me connect to it</font>

180
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:39,169
via open flow let me do something so

181
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:41,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I've complained for 10 minutes you</font>

182
00:05:39,169 --> 00:05:43,250
get my point there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem now what</font>

183
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,440
well the reality is I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> sit around</font>

184
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:47,330
thinking about this all day I don't do

185
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,219
research on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day and we have a</font>

186
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">very small team of facebook so we're</font>

187
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:52,849
here to ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> help on this you know if</font>

188
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:54,199
you have better<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas on how to solve</font>

189
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:55,669
this problem if you already know how to

190
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">solve this problem great I'd like to</font>

191
00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">hear from you you can subscribe to me on</font>

192
00:05:57,349 --> 00:06:00,800
facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can message me on facebook</font>

193
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can email me it's very difficult</font>

194
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,460
it's phf be calm thank

195
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:22,870
very nice so coherent and fast like that

196
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:24,920
any questions questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions aha</font>

197
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,310
identification please<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one damn time</font>

198
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,860
propeller five minds<font color="#E5E5E5"> dinner</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> any wedding</font>

199
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience for empirical measurements</font>

200
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:34,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worried about comparing let's say</font>

201
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:36,710
active active probes versus passive

202
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,380
measurements touches for packet loss or

203
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,200
congestion you had chance to take the

204
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,960
the available examples and compare how

205
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,670
how well one or the other does not maybe

206
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,080
telling you the reality<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you mean like</font>

207
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">the difference between sitting there and</font>

208
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,469
waiting for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a poll to or me to pull</font>

209
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,940
something versus the device to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me</font>

210
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">something oh I I mean something more</font>

211
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,770
mundane for example a congested link

212
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,119
exists somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know where</font>

213
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:02,240
there might be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit discard</font>

214
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,220
counter you're also paying flying in

215
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,590
some sort of matrix between the unloads

216
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,110
or the underlying infrastructure when do

217
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">you see them correlated do you ever um</font>

218
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,350
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see them I mean have you</font>

219
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,910
considered a you know whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

220
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,860
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're either than this time the</font>

221
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,360
right story yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't i don't know</font>

222
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:19,040
that i have like really precise date on

223
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,960
it what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i do know is you know the way I</font>

224
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,090
the way I graph things is you know might

225
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,280
sound silly but I take every air counter

226
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,900
I ever know of any device I take every

227
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,549
device and I roll that up into one giant

228
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,450
graph and it's a little line goes up I

229
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,670
know there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong somewhere</font>

230
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:33,200
right so then I start doing that but

231
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,970
sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that line doesn't go up and it</font>

232
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,380
doesn't go up because of bugs doesn't go

233
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,580
up because the device isn't reporting it

234
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,830
doesn't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because there just isn't</font>

235
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,510
an error counter for whatever the

236
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,919
problem is so in that case that's what I

237
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:45,620
want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know something to actively</font>

238
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,170
monitor to tell me got it so so you're

239
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,790
saying you almost need both yes at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

240
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:51,320
polling probing<font color="#E5E5E5"> plus passive</font>

241
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,790
measurements absolutely because<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

242
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,260
like the routers can have bugs my

243
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:59,030
pulling system can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs so I need</font>

244
00:07:54,260 --> 00:08:01,849
both and two nines put each system gives

245
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:12,039
you how many nines in total in terms of

246
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:12,040
uptime rhetorical<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it very nice</font>
