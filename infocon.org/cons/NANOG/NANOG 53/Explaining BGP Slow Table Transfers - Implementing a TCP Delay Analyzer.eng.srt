1
00:00:02,899 --> 00:00:09,330
hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone thanks for having me here</font>

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,030
so I'm patient so I'm from PT student

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,490
from UCLA so today I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,609
briefly about our recent work on a very

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,920
specific topic is bringing slow table

6
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:22,500
transfer which is the table changer so

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,930
the work<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself is more about the data</font>

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,289
crunching and analysis but for today's

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,198
thought I would try to focus more on a

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:34,590
tool part which is a TCP delay analyzer

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,140
so our thinking is that there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,210
single there's no single study including

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,629
ours can release playin all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PDB</font>

14
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:45,270
province in the wild so we were happy to

15
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,730
share our tools and if you feel you're

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,890
interested after today's talk and every

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,860
maybe you can use the tool to analyze

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,600
your be own bgp traffic and maybe you

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:59,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">can find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's more</font>

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,000
interesting so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> joint work by cure</font>

21
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:07,259
engine from cisco and level 3 so i'll be

22
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,170
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the talk today so by btb table</font>

23
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:12,900
transfer we mean the massive rally

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,240
update<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the click of tagalog version</font>

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:19,590
of rocking table and this could be

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:22,649
triggered by decision reset or or by

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:26,070
some major<font color="#E5E5E5"> role change that we show here</font>

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,110
so this should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at least by the</font>

29
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,360
enzyme<font color="#E5E5E5"> pgp is the heart state</font>

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,150
incremental update<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol but the</font>

31
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem is in practice people to observe</font>

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,590
that this table transfer can be slow and

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,860
it becomes like a common knowledge that

34
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:44,280
the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> jennifer can take even five</font>

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,829
minutes or up<font color="#E5E5E5"> to like 15 minutes so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,049
reason behind is remain unknown so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

37
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,089
couldn't know here because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am really</font>

38
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,610
making an overstatement so when people

39
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,680
to observe it slow then there are some

40
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,630
people including us we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out</font>

41
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,270
what the problem so we do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

42
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,990
papers some previous work that discuss

43
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:07,829
the problem we order button on here is

44
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,810
when it come to operators like us and

45
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,690
when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to our own table transfer</font>

46
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,950
comes to our own<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit appreciations how</font>

47
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,050
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know our</font>

48
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,030
on table chamber of packet by the

49
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">province that reported in the previous</font>

50
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,180
literature are there any new<font color="#E5E5E5"> province</font>

51
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">that specific to our own network or do I</font>

52
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,250
really need to do some sort ideas on

53
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:32,160
step I mean reporting the previous work

54
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,739
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> province so the go</font>

55
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,519
over this talk is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

56
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:41,760
way to identify<font color="#CCCCCC"> the delay time more</font>

57
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:45,080
systematically or more efficiently so

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,780
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is to look at the TCP layer</font>

59
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,400
behavior so after<font color="#E5E5E5"> all bgp is just like</font>

60
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,849
application that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong on top of TCP</font>

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,910
so why TCB<font color="#E5E5E5"> trace here i put the example</font>

62
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:02,339
of a simple bgp table chain for this

63
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:05,489
dough tcp trace so what we can see here

64
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:09,120
is a table transfer that contains the

65
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:14,420
wrong like five mega data but it takes

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm sitting 560 second even like a wrong</font>

67
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,608
66 minutes to finish and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

68
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:23,430
slow so Yuri just roughly calculate the

69
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:26,310
average<font color="#CCCCCC"> easterbrook is only wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 76</font>

70
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">kilobit per second pretty slow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what's</font>

71
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,260
the problem they're here so from the

72
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,350
trace this we can see there are many

73
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:39,170
research mission / be caused by packet

74
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,170
loss and there are some also some period

75
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,489
back here so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> animals period here</font>

76
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:50,489
and they have different<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff is because</font>

77
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:53,100
they they caused by the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp receiver of</font>

78
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:55,500
the ballast window or<font color="#E5E5E5"> layers it's</font>

79
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,630
limited by<font color="#CCCCCC"> center window just after the</font>

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,180
retransmission so all these they

81
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,599
contribute different a banged-up delay

82
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,450
in this table transfer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp I sure is</font>

83
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:11,328
doing vertical here so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do is</font>

84
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:11,328
work on recover the packet loss and

85
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:17,370
limit the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP throughput but the problem</font>

86
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,548
is today here is that we look at PTP

87
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:25,289
usually at a pre kitchen table message

88
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:27,750
only so i put here as example t 30 sorry

89
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:32,130
is a message<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

90
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:34,410
collect and look at today so here we we

91
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,440
have a bunch of update and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

92
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:39,840
tungsten in<font color="#E5E5E5"> unit stem time step and the</font>

93
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,660
other prefix and the bgp paths that are

94
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,580
in the update and the delay i<font color="#E5E5E5"> put here</font>

95
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:50,220
is the delay that the time the test em

96
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:52,830
of this update<font color="#E5E5E5"> related the first update</font>

97
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:57,210
will receive here so looking at this

98
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:59,880
update only this challenge is a little

99
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,489
bit challenging to to see what what

100
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">already problems behind this and it's</font>

101
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,380
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conclude that these</font>

102
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,720
delays<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> caused by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP routing</font>

103
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:13,350
convergence<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely if we don't have any</font>

104
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:15,419
other data for this but actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

105
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,850
all update<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are just come from there</font>

106
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:20,549
retransmission so all these are they all

107
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,380
this delay the optical<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP is doing the</font>

108
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,680
region's meeting what we call the

109
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,680
transport<font color="#CCCCCC"> introduced delay here and the</font>

110
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,840
problem here is that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> just make</font>

111
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,060
the false attribution say this delay our

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,179
caused by the bgp convergence and

113
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,540
another part problem of disease that we

114
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,990
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlook the chance to fix these</font>

115
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,000
transport layer province for here if we

116
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,610
see the street usual nation probably we

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,950
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just raise to see what causes what</font>

118
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:52,470
caused this virtual meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

119
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,780
just beginning so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

120
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:58,680
then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be done reduce</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

121
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,840
delay here another problem is even we

122
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,090
agreed that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at that his</font>

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:09,719
betrays then how it is good like we can

124
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,789
just do the video inspection that we

125
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,729
like we show here we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> look there</font>

126
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:18,090
directly at a trace but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be</font>

127
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:21,210
scale across like especially in some

128
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,580
larger<font color="#CCCCCC"> asp we have many many routers and</font>

129
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,870
we need like this table transfer samples

130
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:30,240
and it's because it also hard to qualify

131
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,479
like looking at this trace only<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

132
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,680
that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> all develop a DNA analysis</font>

133
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:40,349
tool here so the tool we did about we

134
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,060
call it t date so just stand for<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp</font>

135
00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:43,849
didn't

136
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:47,030
none of this tool so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that a</font>

137
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,160
winning this tool that taking the road

138
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,440
trash TV trays and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,110
automatically tell us who are the

140
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,480
contributors for the delay so by

141
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,389
contributors we mean the property of

142
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,820
which like which layer in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beat a</font>

143
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,700
breakage in there so in this context<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

144
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:07,250
a pgp sending process and equip it the

145
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">TCP implementation of the router or</font>

146
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,139
maybe the network interface and also the

147
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,000
where so it's the sending router or the

148
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">resume and outer or the network pass</font>

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,229
that are responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the delay and</font>

150
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,359
for the detail in permanent

151
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:23,510
implementation of the tool we just take

152
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,490
a serious bad approach so what we do is

153
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:30,500
we convert the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCB trays into a bunch of</font>

154
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,290
events serious so the event is like

155
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:36,139
maybe maybe the arrival or the

156
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:39,590
inter-arrival a data packet egg packet

157
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:42,169
or some retransmissions and we record

158
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in two thousand so the even</font>

159
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:49,849
duration and even data so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at</font>

160
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:53,120
the very simplified<font color="#E5E5E5"> trays here we have</font>

161
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:56,930
the egg and we have the data packet so

162
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,110
we can help we can have for example

163
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:03,530
series like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to track the evolution of</font>

164
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:06,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">advertise window so here we receive the</font>

165
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:10,190
egg at T 3 and T Phi so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll record</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

elaborate<font color="#CCCCCC"> eyes window is four and also</font>

168
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,350
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have other series for example the</font>

169
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:21,560
outstanding packet here to recall the

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:24,590
package that has have been sent but not

171
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,440
in acknowledged so here we also have a

172
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:30,530
serious to recall this so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font>

173
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,250
that after<font color="#CCCCCC"> this conversion we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> menu paid</font>

174
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:41,449
we operate on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> series to to infer</font>

175
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:44,390
the delay contributors and the actual

176
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:47,000
implementation is more complicated so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

177
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,880
tried to<font color="#CCCCCC"> briefly talk the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high-level</font>

178
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,130
idea in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this figure so in this one we</font>

179
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">have examples second mentality to be</font>

180
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,920
traced the

181
00:08:54,020 --> 00:09:01,220
top<font color="#E5E5E5"> health here so we have a data packet</font>

182
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,550
the blues or square here and we also

183
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:07,490
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the AG that the X sequence or the</font>

184
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,959
TCP elaborate eyes window and we also

185
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,840
have bunch of regions packet

186
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:18,200
retransmission here so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of the</font>

187
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:21,290
tool is to convert convert the trace to

188
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:26,180
a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> event series what we put here</font>

189
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:29,810
below here the conversion a different

190
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:32,569
series they some-some for some serious

191
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:35,089
the conversion is pretty easy so we can

192
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:37,910
just attract the information pump<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

193
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:40,550
packet header for example the TCP

194
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,949
sequence or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP at the adequate eyes</font>

195
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:45,709
window size but for some serious it

196
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:47,960
could be more difficult we need to like

197
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,170
consider the relative<font color="#E5E5E5"> size of the window</font>

198
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:54,350
and I'll send packet or even the inter

199
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,829
arrival time or packet but anyway after

200
00:09:54,350 --> 00:10:00,740
all these conversions will have bunch of

201
00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:04,600
series as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> put here in a square</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wave</font>

202
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:07,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">form so while we show here on each</font>

203
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:10,970
square wave still represent a<font color="#E5E5E5"> dealer</font>

204
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,730
instance and the ends of the wave is

205
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,580
just is represent the delay that

206
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:19,280
introduced here so simple example is for

207
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:22,130
the retransmission here so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

208
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:25,339
nine retransmission packet so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

209
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:27,980
this will be captured<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a serious here</font>

210
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:32,330
so we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine square waves here</font>

211
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:36,760
so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> denser of each wave is to</font>

212
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:40,430
the time we spent in you transmission

213
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:43,670
after we after we have all these series

214
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:46,339
then we calculate the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dirac delay</font>

215
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,310
contribution so how we do this because

216
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:52,280
we already have this like wave phone

217
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:54,739
series so we just calculate some of the

218
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,530
lens of all the waves and we can divide

219
00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:01,550
it by the another spirit which is the

220
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:06,470
ttp<font color="#E5E5E5"> bgp table transfer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infusion in this</font>

221
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:07,290
case so output of the tool we have like

222
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,800
eight

223
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:14,730
they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hooters</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the pgp for</font>

224
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:17,639
the PDP<font color="#E5E5E5"> center bgp receiver to for the</font>

225
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,480
tcp TP center<font color="#CCCCCC"> key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speed receiver and</font>

226
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:22,560
fold for the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it stems</font>

227
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,990
represent the transformation time and

228
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,649
the loss occur at the receiver side

229
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">center site or in the network pass the</font>

230
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:33,839
ratio here is calculated using the way i

231
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,680
just described so we calculate use the

232
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:41,540
site of a series / another's period so

233
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:46,489
the 25-27 here means for this particular

234
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:49,860
table transfer we spend 27 personal time

235
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:53,160
that is limited by their standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> pdb</font>

236
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:56,220
process so it's a meaning of here and in

237
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:59,790
addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 late contributors</font>

238
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:03,300
we summarize them in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> country</font>

239
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">position country buting groups for the</font>

240
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,219
center side receiver side and the

241
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:11,220
neighborhood<font color="#E5E5E5"> side so what we do is we</font>

242
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:14,730
just take the contributors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

243
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:19,370
occur<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the center and we merge them</font>

244
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:22,170
together and have a new ratio here so

245
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:24,720
this looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a simple addition but</font>

246
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,000
it's not so we what we do is we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

247
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,029
time series<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we take the union of</font>

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,579
them so we consider overlap of them so

249
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:36,149
that the video here could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a little</font>

250
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:40,410
bit lower than the addition of the three

251
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:44,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">values here and we to ascend for the</font>

252
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:49,410
receiver side and the lingo side so the

253
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,120
purpose here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we apply this tool on BP</font>

254
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:54,839
table transfer and we can have these

255
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:58,970
high level indicators<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell us where</font>

256
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:58,970
and who should responsible for the delay

257
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:07,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so moving on through the data set</font>

258
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,399
we apply the tool on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data set we</font>

259
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:14,009
collect<font color="#CCCCCC"> from one isp and reviews and we</font>

260
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,910
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of the excision which</font>

261
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:19,949
will be monitoring setting so in is PA

262
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:20,499
there is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already be too big</font>

collector

264
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:26,019
we shall hear like a pier with

265
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:32,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">aboriginal of original routers and save</font>

266
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:34,989
bgp update and for Rob use we take a gun

267
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:37,629
collector so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the collector</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

268
00:13:34,989 --> 00:13:41,169
Rob use has in the Oregon exchange point

269
00:13:37,629 --> 00:13:44,829
so on top of this we collect on<font color="#E5E5E5"> TTP</font>

270
00:13:41,169 --> 00:13:48,869
traffic and sense to the guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> in is PA</font>

collect the duration and the lumber the

corrector for the software collectors

279
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,858

we use a site fool or you do to what we

289
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:46,720
call a pcap to PDP so we reconstruct the

290
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:49,419
keys beep ice cream from the packet so

291
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:53,019
consider the retransmission amazing

292
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:54,489
package or other order delivery of this

293
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,619
kind of stuff and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't reconstruct</font>

294
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:59,499
the string<font color="#E5E5E5"> and from the stream we</font>

295
00:14:56,619 --> 00:15:02,189
attract<font color="#CCCCCC"> btp message and store them in</font>

296
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:06,129
there a multi-format so based on these

297
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:09,219
constructed a multi files then we apply

298
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:11,859
the method again and to identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

299
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,659
type of transfer so the identify table

300
00:15:11,859 --> 00:15:18,309
transfer the number of a dinner<font color="#E5E5E5"> table</font>

301
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:21,159
transfer summarized here so next up we

302
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:25,118
apply the tool of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tea date that on</font>

303
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:30,309
this table transfers and this is the

304
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:32,409
result folder is PA so to em to repeat

305
00:15:30,309 --> 00:15:33,819
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we have the tape we identify</font>

306
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:36,310
the table transfer

307
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,920
and for each type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> transfer we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apply</font>

308
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:42,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the teat a tool to give us some</font>

309
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:45,370
high-level ratio here the group of a

310
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:47,620
ratio so if level here just means the

311
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,660
sending router responded for<font color="#E5E5E5"> seventy</font>

312
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:54,550
percent for this particular table

313
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:57,219
transfer and for this one supposedly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

314
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:00,099
need to plot in 3d dimension because we

315
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,740
really have three values for each table

316
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,260
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we what we observe is that usually</font>

317
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,360
the network part the delay<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

318
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,780
introduced by the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty low</font>

319
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,090
pretty pretty low so for the ether

320
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,540
presentation I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just put it to the cicada</font>

321
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:18,820
part here so in the figure here the

322
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:22,599
excess is is the sender side ratio and

323
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:24,940
the y y axis is the receiver side ratio

324
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:27,640
and each data point here is a table

325
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,700
transfer so the location of this point

326
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">in this figure tell us who should</font>

327
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,830
responsible more for this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if for</font>

328
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:39,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the data point for the table transfer</font>

329
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:41,470
that at least site at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this corner then</font>

330
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:46,210
it means the receiver which is the

331
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:48,610
cracker here counter hbu more delay for

332
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:52,060
the table<font color="#E5E5E5"> jennifer and of course for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

333
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:55,410
still slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh but another quote the</font>

334
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:58,420
other corner here is for the slow sender

335
00:16:55,410 --> 00:17:01,390
this figure is<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the data from the</font>

336
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:04,119
quagga collector so just one high level

337
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:07,300
of the ocean we can make here is for the

338
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:10,089
vendor collector<font color="#E5E5E5"> trays multiple chain</font>

339
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:12,698
probably a limited by the sender size

340
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:16,560
factor and for the quagga is more<font color="#CCCCCC"> likely</font>

341
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:20,230
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> equally responsible and we do</font>

342
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:23,379
additional step to understand the reason

343
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,790
so for each table<font color="#CCCCCC"> transfer here we</font>

344
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:27,339
further check whether the type of

345
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:30,129
transfer is triggered by the sender of

346
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:34,810
the receiver so you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> table tranfer</font>

347
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:37,960
but which side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router fail to</font>

348
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:40,750
trigger is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a table transfer and we call</font>

349
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,230
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we all related them using the Red</font>

350
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:47,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Square here so each red square here</font>

351
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:50,950
means we have table transfer that is

352
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,810
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the st. inside relative of files</font>

353
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,900
and trigger the following table transfer

354
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:58,780
and once we can learn here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

355
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:01,980
veil inside looks like it seems like

356
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:04,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's more responsible further for the</font>

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,540
delay of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> table chamber and this</font>

failing daughter when II try to restart

360
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:16,180
then each<font color="#CCCCCC"> re start to receive and send</font>

361
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,000

362
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:23,470
straight on itself and make itself more

363
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,590
likely to be the bottleneck but when it

364
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,660
come to the reviews or<font color="#CCCCCC"> Oregon Oregon</font>

366
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:34,360
the trend here and this will you do

367
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:36,580
because for this Oregon collector it

368
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,189
appears<font color="#E5E5E5"> its operators is operational</font>

00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:48,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">really see the trend here so what the</font>

373
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,070
tool can help us here is we just pick

374
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:55,600
one table transfer and the tool can

375
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:57,790
automatically give you some just is

376
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,340
trend we should respond for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

377
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:04,000
in this particular table Jennifer it's

378
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:08,409
been 30 seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> to finish and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reason</font>

379
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:12,100
is that in this case like we show using

380
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:15,640
their contributor here so this every six

381
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:20,040
percent is being their receivers TCP

382
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:22,900
window<font color="#E5E5E5"> responded fall for this feeling</font>

383
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:25,810
so we can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the troopers text</font>

384
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:29,190
notes because the super is just like the

385
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:32,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">rest window / the ground three time the</font>

386
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:34,690
second the second case here is just a

387
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:39,600
slow sender so in this particular case

388
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:42,030
it took 10 and 60 second to finish and

389
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:45,909
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason is that i sent the router</font>

390
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:47,410
often stop so for some reason so even

391
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:50,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">giving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the table</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transfer just stopped</font>

392
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:53,200
sending and this could be due to some

393
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems that we another another</font>

394
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">group-date</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> report</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

395
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,440
in 2009 they found out there sometime

396
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:04,389
orientation of the router so it's only

397
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:07,980
likes in update periodically and the

398
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:10,660
third case here is just a typo duck or

399
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,840
delay but a lot of retransmissions

400
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:15,100
probably due to like packet loss so we

401
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,980
can see that other regions ministry in

402
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,949
here and its capture by the low spirits

403
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:23,710
here the point i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will try to make here</font>

404
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,620
is that we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> not identify this case</font>

405
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:30,310
manually so we apply the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pay</font>

406
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:33,580
down the high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary number we</font>

407
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:36,850
get and then we go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show the</font>

408
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:42,879
trace here to learn for the to show you

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:45,550
the detail tcp and if you like to to

410
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,490
like further investigation this is the

411
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:51,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">screenshot for the software so if you</font>

412
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:55,150
have a TV trays you can generate this

00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,850
sequence figure like a resin left hand

414
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,340
side here and you can use to date to

415
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,740
generate the sequence serious figure

416
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,139
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> i show here and you can use in the</font>

417
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,210
regulation tool to put a positive and

418
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,340
these two windows they are synchronized

419
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,760
which mean you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> give me in route now</font>

420
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:15,730
in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and the time range you</font>

421
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:20,020
specify we also many single<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye to the</font>

422
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:22,890
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so a quick summary why just</font>

423
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp DNA another another</font>

424
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,540
analysis tool and we demonstrate the

425
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:32,230
usage using the kijiji monitoring data

426
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:35,230
in one isp and reviews and suppose the

427
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:37,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can apply on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the operational data so</font>

428
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:39,610
the result could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> even more meaningful</font>

429
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:43,929
in the tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the detail report will</font>

430
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:47,229
be make available at this URL and if you

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out it will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be even more</font>

432
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:52,180
awesome because like I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> limited by</font>

433
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,010
the data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have probably you can</font>

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:58,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">find more part even more interesting</font>

436
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,550
there there are some potential usage of

437
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:06,939
the tool so if you already have a wrong

438
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:08,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">in PDP monitoring settings lucky where</font>

439
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,740
we have PDP characters

440
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:15,360
then you only what you need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

441
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:17,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">just like to capture edit ESP sniffer to</font>

442
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,229
capture the traffic then we'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

443
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,990
bunch of tools to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to process</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCB trace and meet you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> light them on</font>

the t-day to analyze the delay and also

446
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,240
possible if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can you can just sniff</font>

447
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,570
the traffic during to<font color="#E5E5E5"> aboriginal routers</font>

448
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:38,400
and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really need a squad</font>

449
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,320
car collector for example then we'll

450
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,720
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TSB trace we can each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

pieces you<font color="#CCCCCC"> keep a message it for you so</font>

452
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,790
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can really see the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font>

453
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,560
messages delayed during their own

454
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:55,620
messages change between two original

455
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:57,450
authors so for the ongoing<font color="#CCCCCC"> work here the</font>

456
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,760
true can really use some improvement so

457
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,520
we have a bunch of parameter setting

458
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,760
that could be couldn't it need to be

459
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,760
tuned if using in different network

460
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,350
settings and another is that one

461
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,379
assumption i didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mention is that</font>

462
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,939
currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will assume</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

463
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">combinational t three versions so we're</font>

464
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,500
assuming that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP is comes Roy based</font>

465
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,950
on the center<font color="#E5E5E5"> side condition window and</font>

467
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:28,140
this should be fine in this context of

468
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">BGP given that usually routers they</font>

469
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,210
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have fancy his village</font>

470
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:37,470
implementations but if you do know some

471
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:41,160
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know and we also</font>

472
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:46,200

477
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,740
that's it so the point<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this work is</font>

478
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,750
really not too for the result part<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

479
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,260

480
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:10,740

481
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:12,390
to do here it to motivate that or you

482
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:17,010
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're there there's</font>

485
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,680
and you better if you can try the tool

486
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:35,620
or share your peachy color<font color="#CCCCCC"> TTP they</font>

487
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:42,460
taught with us so that's it questions

488
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:44,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the audience a couple detail hi I'm</font>

489
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:50,860
sorry state<font color="#E5E5E5"> your name affiliation Susan</font>

490
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:55,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">hairs long term pgp person my way tcp</font>

491
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:57,879
you made a couple statements and you

492
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,160
worked with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leisha right yeah yeah okay</font>

493
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,750
so a couple statements<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure you have</font>

494
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,190
because you worked with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leisha you have</font>

495
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:06,400
more of the details that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might be</font>

496
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide or post to the list one</font>

497
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,590
is you used if I understood everything

498
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,070
the quagga<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP based on a Linux version</font>

499
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:17,320
you probably have a linux version

500
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,389
specification it would be good if you

501
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,370
would post that or if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would send</font>

502
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,470
that to list or maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm interested</font>

503
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:26,709
because the TCPS as you mentioned do

504
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,990
matter the quagga and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux don't</font>

505
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:33,120
necessarily have the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in house</font>

506
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:36,250
yeah yeah did you second question so

507
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,310
you've done that good please post second

508
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:42,070
the TCP syn the routers are probably

509
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:44,379
more tuned than you think for bgp least

510
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:49,689
to the reports that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've had so that</font>

511
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:52,750
assumption might bear review so have you

512
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:55,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">done any testing with any commercial</font>

513
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,610
router<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCPS actually for your first</font>

514
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,730
question I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check with the data</font>

515
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">source to see if I can really post the</font>

516
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:04,900
detail configuration for<font color="#CCCCCC"> there like a</font>

517
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:09,850
version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the Linux part of the quota</font>

518
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:12,670
and for the second question no I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

519
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:17,169
reject to see each individual routers

520
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:20,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">TDP invitation and how that you are how</font>

521
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:23,740
did you if they have a need like optima

522
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,840
optimization in their routers it might

523
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,540
be good to check have you let me be more

524
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,840
specific and more clear in my question<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

525
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:34,928
apologize if I'm unclear you have

526
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,090
a particular have you done any testing

527
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:41,500
with any commercial routers on this prop

528
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:43,149
on this tool are in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this result they</font>

529
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,760
were sent inside there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are commercial</font>

530
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,679
routers it's just the collector the

531
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,370
receiving side there is one software

532
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,740
routers<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Treasury would it would</font>

533
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:56,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">be good then to also publish the</font>

534
00:26:53,740 --> 00:27:00,630
parameters for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP as that will</font>

535
00:26:56,169 --> 00:27:00,630
matter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what type of</font>

536
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:06,370
parameters you set on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the routers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

537
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:11,049
because that pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of detail</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>

538
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:12,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the difference yeah I agree and does</font>

539
00:27:11,049 --> 00:27:15,340
the receiver take any specific

540
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:18,309
additional code or additions to<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP and</font>

541
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:20,199
is it fourth question since I'm queuing

542
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:25,090
up the questions have<font color="#E5E5E5"> you done it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

543
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:27,789
any of the newer<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCPS you mean when you</font>

544
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:33,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">say newer participe you mean as TCP some</font>

545
00:27:27,789 --> 00:27:35,379
of the other changes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP no so</font>

546
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:38,830
further like I say they are two type of

547
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:42,159
receivers here what is the quagga so for

548
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:44,949
that one probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can have like has</font>

549
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,529
the new TDP meditations but if the

550
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:50,200
collector is just a vendor box then it

551
00:27:47,529 --> 00:27:53,409
really comes to how what<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the TC</font>

552
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:56,500
implantation in those of routers and we

553
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:59,490
don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answers SS to change</font>

554
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:02,529
those are his visitation in vendor box

555
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,809
because they are not sure they're not

556
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:08,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">our box we only take the data and we're</font>

557
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:10,240
analyzing so for this tool to work you

558
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:14,080
do you did say it takes changes to

559
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Quokka tcp stack at current stage now we</font>

560
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,120
only observe their output so we do a

561
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,279
lousy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I develop with TCP dump thank you</font>

562
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,350
very much this is interesting work it's

563
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,179
just the details would be also

564
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,939
interesting since you've piqued the

565
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:31,350
curiosity yeah we have also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

566
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,510
report together at the website and but

567
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:37,418
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really have like the parameter</font>

568
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:39,940
setting in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> report so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can post</font>

569
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:42,399
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would do that without that the</font>

570
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:45,230
data isn't really useful what's a

571
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,590
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the parameters of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP it</font>

572
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,970
hard to judge against other past

573
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:51,230
statistics in this area so<font color="#E5E5E5"> would if you</font>
