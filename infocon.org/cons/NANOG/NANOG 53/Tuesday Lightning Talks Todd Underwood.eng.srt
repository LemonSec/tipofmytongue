Underwood with my co-conspirators Jim

<font color="#CCCCCC">cowie and Tony capella this is a some</font>

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,779
thought experiment plus some initial

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,070
work that we've done to build on some of

6
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,390
the previous<font color="#E5E5E5"> work some of you saw</font>

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,460
presented Nanak 49 in in San Francisco

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:28,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that work was prefixes as</font>

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,850
probabilities<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a modest proposal</font>

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:34,350
to radically extend the life of ipv4 the

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,850
general notion just to remind people

12
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,500
because if you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that talk</font>

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:38,910
this one won't make much sense there's a

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:42,329
good chance this one won't make much

15
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:44,849
sense anyway but the basis of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that talk</font>

16
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:47,520
was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we would allocate unique</font>

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,070
resources only to those<font color="#CCCCCC"> who need unique</font>

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,860
numbering resources and to do so at a

19
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,899
very very very steep premium and then

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,399
recognize the reality that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

21
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,949
as we know it already has lost

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,469
uniqueness of addressing right there's

23
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:05,489
not there are collisions there's

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:07,770
hijacking the there's any<font color="#CCCCCC"> caste all of</font>

25
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:10,740
these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> are addresses in the</font>

26
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet being reused and so we propose</font>

27
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,839
simply extending that to canonicalize

28
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,149
that in the address assignment system so

29
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,009
that if you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really need a unique</font>

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">address you could get an address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

31
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,570
had say 23% probability of being unique

32
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,210
and we had a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of systems anyway</font>

33
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was good work on that</font>

34
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:30,419
keep that in your head because that's

35
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,460
what we're building on people were told

36
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,540
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know that so what happened was we</font>

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,720
gave this talk I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a lot of</font>

38
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,090
discussions afterwards and there were

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,100
some legitimate criticisms one of them

40
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,810
was that prefix collisions when they

41
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened would be in obvious traffic</font>

42
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,350
goes to where it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and something</font>

43
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,420
might just be working and then not

44
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,770
working this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is obviously true</font>

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,570
like so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that we need</font>

46
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">to think about I mean obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

47
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,559
our intent that you might not get fully

48
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,600
functional prefixes all the time but

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,670
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> really thought about strategies for</font>

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,280
mitigating that so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an important</font>

51
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,960
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what this work does so</font>

52
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,909
transmission errors in redirection are

53
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:08,128
difficult to detect and we provided no

54
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,200
mechanism for safely mitigating them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

55
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,730
also heard a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say this</font>

56
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,390
can't possibly work that's obviously

57
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,239
nonsense

58
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:19,149
so there's additional work one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

59
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,240
wonderful wonderful things about the

60
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,890
European Union and China and India in

61
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">the United States as they fund all</font>

62
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,690
manner of research so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no idea</font>

63
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">too silly that has not had a number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

64
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:34,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">important papers published years ago</font>

65
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,410
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it right so I guarantee let go off</font>

66
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,270
and sit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corner and come up with</font>

67
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">the goofiest thing you can come up with</font>

68
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,980
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will find you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> five PhD theses that</font>

69
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:43,830
were published more than four years ago

70
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,869
on that exact subject so this one is

71
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,300
enhanced<font color="#E5E5E5"> spread-spectrum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp right so</font>

72
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,640
the the general idea here was

73
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:54,670
specifically addressing topics of

74
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,738
privacy and topics of use of hostile

75
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:58,510
networks but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good stuff I mean</font>

76
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,670
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is in fact</font>

77
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:03,010
almost exactly what we need so we're

78
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,660
going to reuse these notions for basic

79
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,190
functionality to solve the problem that

80
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,350
we've discussed which is we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

81
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,030
have these addresses they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably be</font>

82
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,329
reused somewhere what are we going to do

83
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so here's the problem statement</font>

84
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,680
ipv4 addresses are increasingly rare and

85
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,480
there is contention we all know this

86
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,320
ipv4 prefixes are no longer quite as

87
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,590
unique as they used to be there's a

88
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,540
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Neil's you got that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Yeah</font>

89
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you thanks</font>

90
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll we'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hargrave did that one um</font>

91
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,730
ipv4 and ipv6 are going to be a

92
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:39,640
coexisting for some time unless ipv6

93
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:42,548
goes away Lorenzo's told me it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

94
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,768
going away but anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're still hope</font>

95
00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:47,260
and there's currently no mechanism for

96
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:50,440
collapsing the matrix of possible or

97
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,720
probable adjacencies across a set of

98
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,570
prefixes or protocols into a usable<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

99
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,070
connection right so there will be math

100
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:58,180
later and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry but there's going to</font>

101
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,920
be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of math but it's going</font>

102
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be okay and Tony can explain it to</font>

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,320
you later<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so continuing the problem</font>

104
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:08,140
statement right if you host content on a

105
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,000
single ipv4 prefix this is serious

106
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,559
vulnerabilities it can be hijacked it

107
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,239
can be spoofed your traffic can be

108
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,430
stolen man-in-the-middle attacks right

109
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,870
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> YouTube Pakistan thing and</font>

110
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:21,340
they're just endless I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> F route</font>

111
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:23,710
absolutely this is only a security

112
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,690
problem as long as you define<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that</font>

113
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,229
way as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you weren't expecting</font>

114
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,560
your prefixes to be high

115
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:32,960
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so prefixes as probability</font>

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,580
has solved<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem of address</font>

117
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,289
allocation but it is not solved the

118
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,270
problem didn't provide graceful

119
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,400
degradation this is a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> similar</font>

120
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,380
problem to what<font color="#CCCCCC"> radio already has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

121
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">even got this unreliable set of</font>

122
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,310
mechanisms and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font>

123
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,480
reliable transport across this so we're

124
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:49,100
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a fixed borrowed from</font>

125
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,250
radium and spread spectrum technologies

126
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,130
to create prefix and<font color="#CCCCCC"> path agile TCP</font>

127
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,260
stack so here's the proposal if you can

128
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">say it's a hat I'm sorry all right so</font>

129
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,710
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to say sparse matrix</font>

130
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,479
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through this and</font>

131
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:03,739
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok I know it's</font>

132
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">lunchtime but we're going to get through</font>

133
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:07,370
the math just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things we're going</font>

134
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,590
to point to you so if you consider<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

135
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">dressing to be a sparse matrix</font>

136
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,560
representing minimum entropy between a

137
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,299
set of endpoints that want to

138
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,570
communicate then your central problem is

139
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:20,240
convergence how can we converge on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a set</font>

140
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these that will work for you and I or</font>

141
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,930
on one that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move later so</font>

142
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,440
the conventional model is push I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

143
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:29,240
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you here use this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you use it</font>

144
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,890
this doesn't scale particularly well so

145
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,560
things like Lisp and I think it's called

146
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,849
sham six and six rat or something<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway</font>

147
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,400
those are all of more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a pull model</font>

148
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,530
like here I'll decide what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

149
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,630
use so our proposal is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use multiple</font>

150
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,039
in multiple out techniques to probe all

151
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,219
of the possible source address

152
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:47,690
destination paths including even ipv6 if

153
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:51,950
you don't have internet and you want to

154
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:54,650
use ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's fine too right so so</font>

155
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:57,050
here's here's something ongoing

156
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:59,479
discussion right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you're aware of this</font>

157
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,800
like smart edge dumb core that's sort of

158
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,900
the mantra that's where we come from

159
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,540
that's like what we believe in this

160
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,909
widens that gap considerably right so

161
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,820
now there's a prefix agile edge and a

162
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:14,420
stochastic core the core doesn't really

163
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,790
exist in any strict sense it exists in a

164
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,620
series of probabilities that need to be

165
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:21,290
probed and calculated right so this is

166
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,790
fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the edge essentially it's</font>

167
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,190
almost like a Schrodinger's<font color="#CCCCCC"> network the</font>

168
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,620
edge creates the core by virtue of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

169
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,030
probing selection strategy right so this

170
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">is fantastic</font>

171
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these Jim Kelly came</font>

172
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:38,529
up with the term the location oblivious

173
00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:40,180
spectrum technologies so this enables

174
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,349
probabilistic clients and servers to

175
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,389
find each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and build reliable</font>

176
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,729
communication as I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font>

177
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,379
simultaneously explore so that you would

178
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">have you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know multiple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> endpoints found</font>

179
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,580
on multiple prefixes on each client and

180
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:56,620
then simultaneously probe all the a and

181
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:58,389
quad a records a this will use math to

182
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,479
reduce the collision rate associated

183
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:04,419
with a prefix and then the ipv6

184
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,770
transition instead of being an undefined

185
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:08,469
transition to an incompatible network

186
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:12,039
protocol it becomes a probabilistic path

187
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:13,870
right over time as people roll out new

188
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,029
networking technologies to replace the

189
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:18,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet then you'll be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to use</font>

190
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:21,430
those on your internet-connected devices

191
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:23,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is a one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tony's slides</font>

192
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,509
here I don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell you the</font>

193
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:27,639
internet is an unknown lossy<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel</font>

194
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:30,189
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of academic work on this</font>

195
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:33,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">hosts are now represented as sets of</font>

00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:47,258
available afterwards for questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

199
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:48,729
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so just a quick just</font>

200
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:52,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">a quick comment on path detection</font>

201
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:54,099
dynamics so some terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

202
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,529
this work so endpoints have exits and

203
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:58,449
entries<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a path is a mapping between</font>

204
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:00,430
an exit and entry and an endpoint

205
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:02,319
address receiver is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> subsystem for</font>

the swag is the data structure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

209
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,930
stores the weights including<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero right</font>

210
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">cuz some of these paths may not work</font>

211
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:14,770
there's an orthogonal vector entry

212
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:17,289
receipt or orthogonal vector X at

213
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:18,909
receipt which is the algorithm for

214
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:20,469
adding a path to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the swag and then</font>

215
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:22,899
there's a backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> entry exit Network</font>

216
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:24,849
dynamic which is the algorithm for

waiting and constantly<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading you don't</font>

218
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:28,899
want to visit these once you don't want

219
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:31,300
to like land on a path and have it go

220
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,610
away right so the availability of a

221
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,979
received size entry or exit is dependent

222
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,649
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup entry network dynamic in</font>

223
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:42,810
the orthogonal vector entry or<font color="#E5E5E5"> C and</font>

224
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:42,809
that works the same for exit by the way

225
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,470
so I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was fast just a couple</font>

226
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,990
comments about future work there's a lot

227
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,690
of unanswered questions I have some you

228
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:56,430
may have some as well so we need a<font color="#E5E5E5"> proof</font>

00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:58,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">of concept on the original work of</font>

232
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:05,640

235
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,580
be work we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need a refinement of the swag</font>

236
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,440
system better modeling of the loss

237
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,990
metrics and some prototyping and

238
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,690
real-world implementations and if there

239
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:21,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">are any questions thanks guys how how</font>

240
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">did the requesters</font>

241
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:31,439
okay Lorenzo<font color="#CCCCCC"> khalidi google I think this</font>

242
00:09:26,609 --> 00:09:33,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">is great work I i see i see strong</font>

243
00:09:31,439 --> 00:09:36,839
parallels between between your work and

244
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,019
the happy eyeballs work that the ITF is

245
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:41,759
is already working on so i really

246
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,220
suggest that you take this to the ITF

247
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,470
and so we can standardize it and we

248
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,669
don't want intro non interoperable

249
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,589
implementations of this right because

250
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:51,299
you we have all this probing going on

251
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,679
and it's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we should you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

252
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,619
really standardized it and move forward

253
00:09:52,679 --> 00:10:02,730
of them so no non interoperable probing

254
00:09:55,619 --> 00:10:05,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">i understand that's right mark cost-mart</font>

257
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:16,230
probit<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually this is</font>

258
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:19,589
amazing breakthrough work thank you so

259
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,689
much time so my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

260
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:24,329
come up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this what sort of course</font>

261
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:27,238
services does one need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide from</font>

262
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:29,638
this sort of venture I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of</font>

263
00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:31,410
framing and dealing with clocking for

264
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,540
example how would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually deal with</font>

265
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,850
that yes so Tony and I talked a little

266
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,029
bit about it one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that</font>

267
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:41,309
this actually it's possible to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

268
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:42,809
with no clocking in particular right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

269
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:45,809
you can do it completely clock<font color="#E5E5E5"> less</font>

270
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:49,339
synchronization mechanism tony was doing

271
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:51,779
it that also had math so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll like man</font>

272
00:10:49,339 --> 00:10:54,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'll admit to not following it entirely</font>

273
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:56,639
but he's the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> tall bald guy so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

274
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,110
could you should go talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Tony but</font>

275
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,419
thank you and we're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

276
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:02,309
forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some support in Aaron for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

so

281
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,230
so math math is really hard i really

282
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,360
only understand how to multiply like 44

283
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:26,430
cents at a time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was wondering is</font>

284
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,560
there a way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can possibly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use this</font>

285
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:30,149
to deliver more than one a hundred

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,290
percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the available bandwidth in</font>

00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,410
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to us to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stop you don't you</font>

289
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,490
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to answer that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

290
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:44,100
that's just dumb just sit down<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

291
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,510
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you sir Chris Luke comcast so</font>

292
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:50,610
we've actually been looking at work like

293
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:52,740
this for real and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually took but</font>

294
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,810
we like going down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the road of using an</font>

295
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:56,010
infinite improbability drive to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

296
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:59,638
I was wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you've done any</font>

297
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:01,680
interoperability studies for this no the

298
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,959
work that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do significantly</font>

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,790
more sophisticated modeling I'm not yet

300
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:07,260
but thank you for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion will</font>

301
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,490
tell we were just running over lines if

302
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,350
your package that everywhere all the

303
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:11,850
time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't have to worry about</font>

304
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:13,500
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> probability for actually showing up</font>

305
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,209
anywhere well that's right so that's

306
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,649
right if I mean one approach we looked

307
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:20,819
at and we discarded simply because we

308
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:23,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">couldn't I there was also a mouth but it</font>

309
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:25,110
had something to do with every packet

310
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,170
can be almost everywhere but not all

311
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,029
packets can be everywhere at all times

312
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:31,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">in any way we designed like my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> high</font>

313
00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:33,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">level physics now yeah well exactly</font>

314
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,939
and then Tony's like blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah</font>

315
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,500
signal blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah you're going to</font>

316
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:39,660
burn up the universe or something I

317
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would wish in a working</font>

318
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:43,110
group and we know there would never be

319
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:45,360
any usable results for years to come

320
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,660
well I mean I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's actually what</font>

321
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,970
Lauren's are just suggested was a very

322
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,610
sophisticated social sabotage right this

323
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">came up at the FCC as well avi Friedman</font>

324
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:58,350
server central to answer marks question

325
00:12:55,949 --> 00:13:01,139
my home network which is consists of

326
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,779
half<font color="#CCCCCC"> protons and half micro routers uses</font>

327
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,730
a protocol called directed intercarrier

328
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,630
clocking so I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

329
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,370
thing that you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make ours what is</font>

330
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:16,529
to make ours most useful is a little bit

331
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:18,510
of dick<font color="#CCCCCC"> and on that note it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> almost</font>

332
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,490
impossible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> argue with that comment so</font>

333
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,750
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're done here anybody who</font>

334
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,310
would like to contribute to this work

335
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,769
please come<font color="#E5E5E5"> find me or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jam more Tony</font>

336
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,829
later thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very much</font>

337
