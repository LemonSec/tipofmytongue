1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:11,130
okay i am chris griffiths<font color="#E5E5E5"> comcast the</font>

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,768
talk briefly about what our work on DNS

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:17,240
SEC is and what we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on so</font>

4
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:20,430
last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I spoke at nanog 51 we were</font>

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,500
kind of talk through specifically we're

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,529
doing about five percent of our DNS

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:34,730
traffic was actually do doing performing

8
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:37,970
validation thank you cool thanks

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:40,339
so we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about 5% validation for</font>

10
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:44,059
and this is all of our residential and

11
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,530
commercial subscribers we also had a

12
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple hundred zones that we were</font>

13
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,989
managing and doing key rollovers for we

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">are now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing roughly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty-five</font>

15
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:56,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">percent of our footprint is now</font>

16
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:57,739
performing validation that's a pretty

17
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:59,239
significant number and we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> continuing</font>

18
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:02,300
to ratchet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that up over the next couple</font>

19
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:05,149
months the other thing and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Matt</font>

20
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,820
just pointed out so we're actually now

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,430
signing several thousand zones so we've

22
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:13,000
been doing a significant number of our

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:15,979
authoritative zones doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns X signing</font>

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,289
that's taken a lot of operational time

25
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:21,350
and process to build over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last few</font>

26
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:23,930
years but we're now basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing this</font>

27
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:27,199
in real scale the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we've</font>

28
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,910
worked with our registrar to actually

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,970
automate the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

30
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:34,280
one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> big significant timing issues</font>

31
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,410
for getting all of our zone signed and

32
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,149
getting things<font color="#E5E5E5"> completed so we've</font>

33
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,740
actually spent a considerable amount of

34
00:01:38,149 --> 00:01:41,539
time automating that process so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,000
now sign much faster and actually get

36
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:49,399
you know the many thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of zones</font>

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,810
that we managed DNS SEC enable so wanted

38
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put a little example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we've</font>

39
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:56,390
what we've been doing on our and you can

40
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:00,020
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the nog lab which we</font>

41
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,880
actually have over in the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> room but</font>

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:04,039
this this actually shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">anycast</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> resolvers that we that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

44
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,479
deployed on our network and it actually

45
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,910
shows one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our like top domains</font>

46
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,950
xfinity TV com so this is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

47
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,140
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> production domains that actually</font>

48
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,619
service a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of our customers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

49
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,450
specific TV services and you know this

50
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">is now assigned zone it's actually fully</font>

51
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,790
validated and you know we set the ad bit

52
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,470
and everything looks as as it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should but</font>

53
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:32,629
this is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're seeing in</font>

54
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:34,670
production now so another thing we've

55
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:36,379
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on as well you know he may</font>

56
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">have heard that we've been involved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

57
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:41,149
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the ipv6 items over the last few</font>

58
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:43,700
years as well so one of the things we

59
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">just recently launched is our ipv6</font>

60
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,829
anycast resolvers as well so

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:50,079
these are now available for our

62
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:52,330
customers that as we ratchet up our

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,430
trials and eventual deployment for ipv6

64
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,250
for our customers we'll be deploying

65
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,750
these specific any case resolvers to our

66
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:01,750
customers as well these are also

67
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:04,810
validating resolvers so whether you're

68
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:06,520
using ipv4 or ipv6 as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> double stack</font>

69
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,280
environment will be getting DNS SEC

70
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,880
validation so essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> also we've</font>

71
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,820
dual stacked and enabled glue for all of

72
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,460
our domain specific to resolution so as

73
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,079
you're doing dual stack lookups over v6

74
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,330
you're also able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate against the</font>

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
glue records as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's about just</font>

76
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,810
had an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example up here specific to</font>

77
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,459
comcast.net but as you can see we have

78
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:32,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">the quad a records and everything is</font>

79
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:35,050
enabled within that<font color="#CCCCCC"> within that zone so</font>

80
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:37,030
again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted to point out also you can</font>

81
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,410
actually and you can go to the nog lab

82
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,240
and actually test this directly because

83
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,049
that that lab is actually sitting off of

84
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,850
one of our production drops<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

85
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:47,890
essentially you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do dig directly</font>

86
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,440
against our anycast ipv6 resolvers

87
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:52,329
against the same domain xfinity TV<font color="#CCCCCC"> calm</font>

88
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:59,920
and you know essentially validate that

89
00:03:52,330 --> 00:04:02,140
zone it it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just works so so briefly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

90
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,910
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know kind of point</font>

91
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,399
the fact that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are doing this</font>

92
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,900
at scale so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean we have you know 17</font>

93
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,540
million plus subscribers and we were

94
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,010
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not only do validation and we've</font>

95
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,540
taken a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time and effort to do</font>

96
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,659
this but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would recommend you know</font>

97
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:18,310
certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a large medium or</font>

98
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,989
small<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP you should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely be</font>

99
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:21,910
taking a look at doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> validation and</font>

100
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:27,299
possibly signing your domains as well

101
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,300
it's good for everybody so thank

102
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:49,220
any questions for Chris Peter Peter

103
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:53,810
washer is C so just so just to check so

104
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:56,600
if i type say ww comcast net<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

105
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,160
able to get valid it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm wearing a</font>

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,980
validating resolver<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should be able to</font>

107
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,260
get response so come kiss and net we're

108
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,270
actually that's one of our really<font color="#E5E5E5"> high</font>

109
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,820
level domains so we're still in the

110
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:09,530
process of signing those but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I</font>

111
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">expect to have those signed very soon</font>

112
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm because I tried like Xfinity</font>

113
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:18,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">calm which redirects to xfinity comcast</font>

114
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,909
com or net or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we saw</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

115
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:21,740
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the very high value domains we're</font>

116
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,710
still in the process of making<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that</font>

117
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,270
we get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> process correct but again i</font>

118
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,169
would expect very soon that those will

119
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,169
be signed<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

120
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:37,750
I've got a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> for you are there</font>

121
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:43,540
any sort of DNS SEC related<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk</font>

122
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:44,830
stories you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can share</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with us on I yeah</font>

123
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,100
you don't forget specific but I'm just

124
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:50,260
did you notice anything or well

125
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly you know especially in the</font>

126
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,120
validation<font color="#E5E5E5"> side i mean it's there are</font>

127
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,900
certainly some top-level domains that

128
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,460
have not spent nearly enough time with

129
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,159
their operational processes that they

130
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,500
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have so we have seen</font>

131
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:09,130
some breakage specific to domain so we

132
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have had to disable validation</font>

133
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:14,380
specific for those<font color="#CCCCCC"> sub domains within</font>

134
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:17,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">them so we've automated a lot of that</font>

135
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,560
process but again it's you know few and

136
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:22,419
far between but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do see it you know it</font>

137
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,880
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> we just have to disable</font>

138
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:28,060
validation and notify those folks to fix

139
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,290
their domains and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you find</font>

140
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:35,620
that it's easy or difficult to identify

141
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:38,230
DNS SEC as the cause I think it's more

142
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,880
associated to the management<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

143
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,860
specific domains whether it be key

144
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,040
management or record management so i

145
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:47,800
think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know dns</font>

146
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:53,340
administration more than specific DNS

147
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:58,240
SEC type items yeah sopia washer again

148

149
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,190
matter of course do your recursive

150
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:06,099
servers or caching servers both allow

151
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:10,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">ETA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ed and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s arrow and allow up to 40</font>

152
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:16,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">for kbyte responses on UDP and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP yes I</font>

153
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,070
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you as part of your</font>

154

deployment schedule have you sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

155
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:24,670
informed your customer service<font color="#E5E5E5"> teams or</font>

156
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,610
whether it be business or consumer about

157
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:30,280
the fact that their dns servers may not

158
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,560
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to resolve comcast net or</font>

159
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,820
comcast com because all of a sudden

160
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,730
their responses are bigger because

161
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,260
you're including the DNS SEC signatures

162
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:39,400
yes so we've actually spent a

163
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:40,890
considerable not until I'm actually

164
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,820
detailing a lot of the different

165
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:46,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">customer care and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

166
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:49,570
the things it we probably the last

167
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,000
couple years we spent you know informing

168
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:53,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">all you know and writing up you know how</font>

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,630
to how to troubleshoot and deal with

170
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:58,419
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things so that it's a you know</font>

171
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,340
hopefully not a surprise when you know

172
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,840
items come up it still will be a

173
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:08,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">surprise to a lot of people believe me</font>
