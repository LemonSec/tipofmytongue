it represents for us the start of a

long-term program it's an we viewed it

6

acquiring data on the legacy PSTN but in

that broadband networks have not been

to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the most significant</font>

33
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,199
thing recently was that the 1996 the

00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:40,140
Telecommunications Act was rewritten and

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,119
section 706 of that act required an

annual report<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the availability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

40
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,990
interesting because today most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us</font>

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,210
take broadband technology and Internet

44
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,420
in information specific on the

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">is done on a yearly basis now there's a</font>

47

form called form 477 that goes out to

48
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:16,739
all ISPs and they required under

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,840
law to report back to the FCC on the

50
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,610
deployment of broadband technology and

51
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,800
that's been expanded and adapted over

52
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:26,010
time so the FCC has a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fairly good</font>

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,430
understanding of the capital impact of

deploying broadband technology more

55
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,920
recently the FCC released the National

2010 and that plan for the first time

58
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,660
proposed that we ought to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out more</font>

about performance measurements<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

by a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different areas there was</font>

75
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:31,230
two thousand ten suggested that the

76
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,590
advertised rates to consumers were

77
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:37,320
sometimes overly optimistic some of the

78
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,360
reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we had identified suggested</font>

79
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,519
that carriers delivered only fifty

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,400
percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the advertised rates and</font>

81
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,180
certainly this was the measured result

00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,459
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> England so the work that we began to</font>

undertake evolved out of the National

84
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:57,030
Broadband Plan this was really the first

<font color="#E5E5E5">effort by the Commission to do this we</font>

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:11,760
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go forward with this and we</font>

91
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,100
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would bet we better to do it</font>

92
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,690
in an open transparent fashion and work

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:18,209
with a broader<font color="#CCCCCC"> range of interests as</font>

94
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,399
possible rather than do this with wholly

95
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,890
within the Commission so we approached

96
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,380
the number of ISPs we approach to

97
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,570
academia consumer groups

98
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,270
we put out public notices regarding our

99
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,060
intent regarding this and these

100
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,240
interactions as that you fall this

101
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,680
initial study and I'll emphasize the

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,270
broadband measurement work is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

103
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,250
progress it's still ongoing at the

104
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,710
present time we're continuing some

105

107
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,720
again we view this as the stuff very

108
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:57,090
formative and exploratory start of a

109
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:00,390
program so what did we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do we</font>

110
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:02,130
enlisted<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cooperation of 13 ISPs that</font>

this program we covered eighty-six

in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States we formed an ad hoc</font>

128
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,219
minus the good intent and but over time

129
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:52,410
because this was a very eclectic<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

130
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,930
of people so a lot of distrust beginning

131
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:57,360
but over time working over a period of

132
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,910
six to eight months<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did form</font>

134
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,710
among the participants we reached an

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,900
agreement on what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to measure</font>

and how to measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I should have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">but what what the measurement technique</font>

139
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:17,609
involved was sending out routers to each

volunteer consumer participant each

141

measurements on a periodic basis they

143

225
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:16,390
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could have resolved down to a census</font>

the highlights and perhaps the most

243
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:58,869
interesting result is that we what we

244
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">found is that most isp's deliver close</font>

to advertised rates even<font color="#CCCCCC"> during peak</font>

00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,920
hours now shortly before we issue our

250
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:14,430
even after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess our report came out</font>

251
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:17,820
we had some dialogues with certain

252
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,829
groups that this result was not correct

253
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,839
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody has seriously attacked</font>

254
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:23,670
the study that we did and on a personal

255
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,070
level I believe the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> are accurate</font>

256
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,319
and differ dramatically from what we saw

257
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,209
in Europe<font color="#E5E5E5"> for several reasons perhaps</font>

258
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">most significantly is our carriers tend</font>

259
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:36,329
to advertise a specific rate we're in

260
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:38,550
say England they advertise a service and

261
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,319
you take whatever rate you're capable of

262
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,209
running at so they tend in that

263
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
environment the opportunity to emphasize

264
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:46,410
optimistic or to advertise

265
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,110
optimistically is much greater here

266
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:53,069
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> more of a service contract</font>

267
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:55,889
paradigm and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think most ISPs actually</font>

268
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,380
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deliver reasonably close to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

269
00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're advertising if that one hundred</font>

270
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:02,279
percent line you see there is the

271
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,290
hundred percent advertised service line

272
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,600
those rates are normalized against that

273
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,290
line and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the carriers are above</font>

274
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,339
eighty percent even during peak hours

275
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,000
there's a different view of the same

276
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:18,269
data and some carriers don't deliver

277
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,610
what they're promising and we saw a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

278
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:22,199
of variability between carriers in terms

279
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:29,279
of the engineering rules that they

280
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:30,540
applied performance varies by ISPs one

281
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,329
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can pick out in the</font>

282
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,310
data is that the ISPs not surprisingly

283
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:38,160
each have their individual performance

284
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:40,619
objectives and a large number of their

285
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,019
service<font color="#E5E5E5"> tears group within those</font>

performance objectives occasionally

287
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:47,370
you'll find a service tier a rate that's

engineering rules that<font color="#E5E5E5"> their people</font>

00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:09,839
was always friendly and collegial one of

295
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,040
the biggest battles we had in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

296
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:17,220
discussion was a cable telco fight over

00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,870
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you define speeds the cable</font>

298
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,760
companies

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:24,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">ties and offer something called burst</font>

300
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:26,360
speed which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> queuing technique</font>

301
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,230
providing a temporary speed increase

302
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:33,380
from what we found less than 15 seconds

303
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:35,600
so and we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great deal of argument</font>

304
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:40,670
over whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> include that</font>

305
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">as a rate and we did a truly Solomon</font>

306
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:45,469
like decision we did split the baby and

307
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:47,240
we offered up both<font color="#CCCCCC"> speeds so if you read</font>

308
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,940
our report we have both what we call

309
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,720
sustained speed which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a long-term</font>

310
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:55,370
duration speed as well as a burst speed

311
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,620
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically measured over a period of</font>

312
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,890
30 seconds after a<font color="#CCCCCC"> start-up interval and</font>

313
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,570
the first five seconds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that 30-second</font>

314
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,360
interval was taken as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> burst speed</font>

315
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:07,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the final five seconds of that</font>

316
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,190
30-second interval was taken as a metric

317
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,170
for the sustained speed we do believe

318
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:14,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">that for certain types of services the</font>

319
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:17,060
cable industry has a valid argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

320
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:19,190
for certain types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of applications birth</font>

321
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,939
speed can be meaningful and therefore we

322
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:25,040
agreed to include it but it can

323
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,779
generally be applied to DSL we are

324
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,750
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the sink rate or the maximum</font>

327
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,370

thirty seven megabits to seventy five

329
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,640
megabits a provision bandwidth so so it

330
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:46,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">really is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a cable industry offering at</font>

331
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:50,180
this time and we did include the results

332
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:53,420
we looked this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this particular</font>

334
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:58,490
normalized impact of birth speed so in

335
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,760
effect what I'm showing here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

336
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,890
performance improvement over sustained

337
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,560
speed that bursts makes and you can see

338
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,209
that most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact of birth speed</font>

339
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,619
can be seen between six and<font color="#E5E5E5"> twelve</font>

340
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,060
megabits per second from what we

341
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:13,370
measured in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cable industry and</font>

342
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:15,920
declines as the higher you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go the effect</font>

343
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:19,400
drops off in term in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of impact on</font>

speed its highest<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate is its highest</font>

345
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,949
impact is around six to eight megabits

346
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,959
another thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw in the study is</font>

347
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,599
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are still an a symmetric</font>

350
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,110
ISPs that we looked at download speed is

351
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:43,859
limiting factor and continues to be

352
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:46,709
limiting factor in the industry we

353
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:50,879
looked at reliability packet loss rate

354
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:52,739
was generally less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1% and there was</font>

355
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,179
some correlation between peak periods

356
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,569
and packet loss with higher loss

357
00:15:54,179 --> 00:15:59,249
occurring of course during peak hours

358
00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:02,128
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even during peak periods most</font>

359
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:04,740
companies a packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> loss rate was less</font>

360
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:07,800
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> point four percent and the worst</font>

00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:11,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">case seen during our formal study month</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> March was point eight percent we did</font>

363
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,629
see some results we work as I said

364
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:18,839
collaboratively with a couple of

365
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:21,720

of one percent packet loss and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll note</font>

saw was<font color="#CCCCCC"> webpage downloading we</font>

377
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:54,259

00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:57,809
measured the time required to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that</font>

379
00:16:54,259 --> 00:17:00,420
what we started to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see was that at</font>

380
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:03,839
higher rates you start to have

381
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:06,569
diminished comparative performance so if

382
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,220

<font color="#CCCCCC">they're advertised consumers can't get</font>

440
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,360
that performance level yet in the

441
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,890
internet you know what are the

442
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,760
performance metrics we should be looking

443
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:30,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">at them so I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> higher speeds</font>

444
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,660
may challenge industry to examine

445
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:34,670
performance bottlenecks and certainly it

446
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:36,290
will challenge the Commission to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

447
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,700
performance metrics in terms of what's

448
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:42,290
meaningful another thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to do</font>

449
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,240
and I emphasize again well you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font>

reported on but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things we</font>

456
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:00,159
tried to do was ask industry luminaries

457
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:03,310
generally chief technologists or CEOs of

458
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:07,450
other companies how much speed is needed

459
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:08,770
for want and as the Commission<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

at the Commission all my life but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

470
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,750
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> took advantage of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and surveyed</font>

and reliability the connection is

525
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,520
important cool things we tried to

526
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:55,050
measure within the study and I think all

527
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,050
things will focus on in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> term</font>

529
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,260
measuring the performance of the ISP so

530
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:05,110
what we're measuring is the performance

531
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:07,600
from somebody's basement to the first

532

the over that some of the current

551
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:00,429
is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FCC has released its rules</font>

on an open<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet one of them focuses</font>

service performance to consumers so

557

we've told<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet service providers</font>

everybody gets annoyed sometimes people

even get fired so<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are networks</font>

we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a realistic request to</font>

study at least one more time so we'll

probably in March redo the study will

603

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,720
delivering to the end user we don't know

00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:36,680
I logs now with ISPs on that whether we

00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:40,220
keep the same measurement criteria

623

whether we evolve it<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're ready talking</font>

about possible linking up to different

want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take the people out of it the</font>

630
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:00,409
first effort was very manually intensive

631
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,510
we had to vet each panelist each

that's all can be automated that's part

of this process this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,200
long-term effort that we're undertaking

638
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,699
discussion with the ISPs we're still

associated with those thousand ISPs it's

653
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,760
a different challenge than doing 13 you

654
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,490
can't apply the same methodology the

655

survey survey approach we're starting to

656

proxies that we can use to work with

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> still being debated another thing</font>

691
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,060
outreach to MIT and Georgia Tech and we

692
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:38,010
worked with the ISPs who brought almost

693
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,740
as many engineers as lawyers to the

694
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:42,570
table which was which way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the beef</font>

695
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:45,120
it now be fair to the Internet service

696
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:48,600
providers they really<font color="#CCCCCC"> did a wonderful</font>

697

job on this they brought their a team we

00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,449
had access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to their engineers we started</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">with a schema that a company called Sam</font>

702
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:04,560
adapted it based upon the discussion so

703
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:08,280
we originally envisioned this as a

704
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:10,770
six-month project and less collaborative

705
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,270
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry and after some initial</font>

706
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:15,780
discussions that we saw an opportunity

707
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:17,370
to work with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry we changed the</font>

708
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,100
methodology so instead of doing this

709
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:22,290
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ofcom did we decided to do it</font>

710
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:23,610
embrace the embracing industry which was

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the objectives the Broadband Plan</font>

713
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,930
suddenly we had 13 companies we had to

work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the academics</font>

715
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:35,430
and in addition to consumer groups we

716
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,080
had suggestions from MIT and how to

717
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:38,130
change some one of the things a mighty

718
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,800
brought into the pot they were

719
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:42,540
interested in latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> under load so if</font>

you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not brought out in</font>

the report formal report is in the data

of discussion it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a big split within</font>

CC with Solomon you'd have the story

728
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,160
ending with a baby split in half because

we that was our solution to the problem

730
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,310
each got what they wanted and there was

731
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,780
some interesting discussion and I'm not

to take this into a standards body we

process for ipv6 adoption there's been

764
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:53,409
some discussion that especially from the

765
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:56,290
ISPs that the the current metrics were

766

using don't really capture faithfully

767

the the adoption rates that are going on

768
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:04,120
and and the other issue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

brought back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us was better government</font>

which is the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> major government</font>

774
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:20,990
stakeholder in this area we've agreed to

775
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:22,580
work collaboratively on this in fact

776
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:24,680
we're trying to organize a workshop I

777
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:29,240
don't we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a date for it yet</font>

778
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:32,410
that would focus on policy metrics for

779
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:36,230
tracking ipv6 evolution as well as a

780

recount of ipv sins learned IV v6 day is

781
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:42,740
the broad objective so we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting</font>

782
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:44,630
to approach that issue from there and

783
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,420
how we would institutionalize it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

784
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:50,270
would be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer-term question so God</font>

does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer your question kind of</font>

786
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,850
yeah thanks good afternoon good

787
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,399
afternoon Dan Ellis from pentola data do

788
00:33:55,850 --> 00:34:00,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recommendations for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the you</font>

789
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,140
know any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ISPs other than</font>

790
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,150
the 13 on how to possibly proceed with

791
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,100
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information the FCC is</font>

792
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:10,159
requiring such as the realistic speed

793
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,719
numbers I mean as of<font color="#E5E5E5"> November the FCC</font>

794
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,639
wants us to publish that information to

795
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:16,339
the customers but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you guys</font>

796
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,679
know the complexities<font color="#CCCCCC"> of trying to well</font>

797
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,350
I mean I can tell you what first of all

798
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,300
we're not prescribing any specific way

799
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:26,299
so this is not do it my way or the

800
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:28,280
highway so what we we've given whatever

801
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:31,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think is an engineer is a regional</font>

802
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:35,090
objective<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay give give some reasonable</font>

803
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,399
expectation of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the average service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font>

804
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,840
but your customer should see<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay now</font>

805
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:40,549
then we've also gone on and said if you

806
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,889
want to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like what we</font>

807
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,659
didn'ts and those one you can you can

808
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:47,659
certainly roll your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own because we've</font>

809
00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:49,190
published the methodology so if you want

810
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:51,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you and you</font>

811
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:53,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to make the investment you can you</font>

812
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:54,770
know build your own there are outside

813
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,389
companies if you want to do that

814
00:34:54,770 --> 00:35:00,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach Sam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knows being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them</font>

815
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:02,750
that you can contact to perform such a

816
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:07,100
measurement or as I said you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

817
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:10,280
internal resources so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> started with a</font>

818
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,080
broad approach as we get better guidance

819
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,090
from industry maybe we'll be able to

820
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:17,569
refine that but we tried not to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

821
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:19,580
onerous so we gave options to a number

822
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:20,900
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different companies we also by the</font>

823
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">way if you said if you're very small</font>

824
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,640
company

825
00:35:21,749 --> 00:35:27,279
I'm we were suggesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's an</font>

826
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,420
out that that if currently if you're a

827
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">very small company you can point to one</font>

828
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,019
of the bigger guys and say well you know

829
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,989
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> typical performance for this</font>

830
00:35:35,019 --> 00:35:39,879
technology except one other question

831
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:42,789
have you considered looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at any of</font>

832
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,890
the data from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns that may be able</font>

833
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:48,369
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> also give you performance data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ate</font>

834
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:52,538
something up let me put this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my terms</font>

835
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:54,519
it's something I'm interested in and to

836
00:35:52,539 --> 00:35:56,380
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we've used a very voluntary</font>

837
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:59,499
process so yeah it's something I'd be

838
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,599
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing we're expecting to</font>

839
00:35:59,499 --> 00:36:04,238
increase the dialogues we're having with

840
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:10,749
with broader interests over time thank

you high enough you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco let me</font>

845

kind of things but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meantime a</font>

carrier-grade not functionalities

849
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:29,710
certainly in the mobile space this is

850
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:33,579
being used heavily and people are

856
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,230
what I've already said and then reported

the government agencies that that's our

immediately on a table no are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

starting to focus on moving in the

direction where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a say a</font>

part of the goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least that that the</font>

00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">tack is recommended I guess my point is</font>

00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:34,119
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular in the mobile industry</font>

877
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,529
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is heavenly you</font>

878
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,970
so if you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the moment</font>

879
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:44,499
this would help this with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:57,849
related to wire line connections correct

884
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:02,740
are you looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at expanding the program</font>

we're talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> let me not looking--</font>

888
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:13,869
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the possibility of</font>

889
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:16,808
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do in mobile</font>

890
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:19,420
mobile is much more complex for the

891
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:20,799
reasons it's of the variability<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

892
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,400
technology the fact that people are

moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> around we are probably going to</font>

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something this year I'll just leave</font>

895
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">it this we had it's an area of interest</font>

896
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,799
to question whether we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can engage on</font>

897
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,269
something that's practical but we are

898
00:38:35,799 --> 00:38:39,670
looking at it as well I can really say

899
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:43,058
so does when you say mobile does that

900
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:45,579
include Wi-Fi I know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the initial</font>

Dylan green Microsoft quick question

905
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:04,569
about user experience when you're

906
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:06,759
running these tests did the users report

907
00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:10,029
adverse impact to their normal

908
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:13,210
experience the tests were<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed to</font>

909
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:15,970
grab the pipe when the user wasn't doing

910
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:18,220
anything and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user came online</font>

911
00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:21,279
if they exceeded a certain threshold the

912
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:23,618
test would cease statistically we got

913
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:25,420
enough data that we were transparent to

914
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:28,180
the user and still able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> acquire a ton</font>

915
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,349
of data but the idea was we didn't want

916
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,019
to we didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get in front of the</font>

00:39:29,349 --> 00:39:34,779
user another issue we had to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

918
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:36,758
account which which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an evolving issue</font>

919
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:40,480
our bandwidth caps some of the tests for

920
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:42,249
example download tests are starting to

921
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,900
run up against bandwidth caps and we had

922
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:45,910
to adjust<font color="#E5E5E5"> the scheduling of the tests</font>

923
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,810
such that they wouldn't come close to

924
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:49,430
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> we wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font>

925
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:55,460
act any any significant impact on

926
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:58,870
bandwidth caps thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay all right</font>

927
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,870
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you very much</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks</font>
