1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,319
thanks and good morning and think of the

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">opportunity to come and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you this</font>

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">morning this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly a technical</font>

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,830
presentation because it dives around a

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole bunch of topics that I hope are as</font>

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,990
much interest to the folk in the Aaron

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,570
community around address policy-making

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,859
as it would be to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the folk in nanog</font>

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:30,539
around the area of making it all work so

10
00:00:27,859 --> 00:00:33,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about</font>

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:37,770
address exhaustion but let me first give

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:40,620
you some context you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all part</font>

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:44,489
of an industry that has existed for an

14
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,959
awfully long time the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time we</font>

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,589
tried to actually transmit information

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,800
down copper wires for profit and fun was

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,329
probably around 1836 1837 when we

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,980
figured out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if we could make and</font>

21
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,799
telegraphy took over the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

22

actually changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world enormously I</font>

days by telegraph it was amazing it

transformed society of course it was

30
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,030
transformational in many other ways each

telegram cost the equivalent of three

32
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,049
weeks working wages and because a lot of

folk who spoke Pashtun rather than

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,699

<font color="#CCCCCC">forty percent but nevertheless it</font>

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:58,979
transformed the place but then we

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,210
in America AT&T was the world's largest

54
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,180
just bonkers it never stood a hope and

revolutionized our lives in recent times

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:27,720
was accidental SMS guys was never meant

67
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,220
to happen a hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty bites is</font>

68
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,130
not enough to say anything meaningful

69
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,950
just look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole IP</font>

70
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:37,049
thing was not a<font color="#CCCCCC"> plan d a planned</font>

71
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:39,179
conquest of the world it was an

00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:43,250
experiment<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were just trying to figure</font>

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:52,230
the industry despite its<font color="#E5E5E5"> size was never</font>

75
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,910
good at getting things right and so when

76
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,570
you look at the challengers we're facing

77
00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:00,480
today how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we going to do with the</font>

78
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:03,120
latest challenge because in running out

79
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,470
of v4 addresses and trying to bridge the

80
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,140
gap across<font color="#E5E5E5"> to v6 it's not clear to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me at</font>

81
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">any rate that we're going to do this</font>

82
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,500
with accuracy precision and success to

83
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,890
my mind it's still a bit open as to

84
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,358
which way that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go now you</font>

85
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:22,620
know the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of question when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

86
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,239
get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't Jeff you're just</font>

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,890
obsessing about crap mate you know do

88
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">you really have to worry about this kind</font>

89
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,150
of stuff I make sure

90
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,850
it's just going to happen surely when we

91
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,620
address when we exhaust<font color="#CCCCCC"> v4 surely that's</font>

92
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,900
the only option<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this planet right</font>

93
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,570
once the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pressure on V for exhaustion</font>

94
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,669
gets high enough then v6 is simply going

95
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">to happen I've seen it on your mailing</font>

96
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:45,900
lists I've seen it on mailing lists all

97
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:49,350
over the planet all you have to do is

98
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,950
wait exhaustion is going to drive v6

99
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:57,060
deployment or is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> just meaningless</font>

100
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:59,420
mantra is that just stuff we recite to

101
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,210
ourselves as some optimistic hope

102
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:06,780
without substance is the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

103
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,239
to follow that plan or not so when you

104
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,390
look at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you kind of think what</font>

105
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,390
things in the past were inevitable and

106
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,729
is this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them you know the first</font>

107
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:20,250
way we tried to do telephony was by

108
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:22,050
wires and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more people wanted to talk</font>

109
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:24,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">the more wires you had to string up and</font>

110
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,670
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what New York got to some time</font>

111
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,460
in whenever it was back<font color="#CCCCCC"> then that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

112
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,770
real limiting factor was a putting

113
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,020
enough copper in long strands and be

114
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,090
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough wood up there to hold all</font>

115
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,219
the copper up in the air and quite

116
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,900
frankly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineering nightmare of</font>

117
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,620
stringing another wire up for the next

118
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,020
subscriber must have been phenomenal so

119
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,990
of course from then the move to virtual

120
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,180
circuits from where we sit today was

121
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,790
completely inevitable there was no more

122
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:58,200
space in the air for more copper so then

123
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:59,430
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> moved to virtual circuits yeah the</font>

124
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,050
problem is of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a picture</font>

125
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:04,440
of a virtual circuit so you know blank

126
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:06,240
screen sorry and from then on<font color="#CCCCCC"> we moved</font>

127
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,160
to packets and again sorry there's no

128
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,169
picture of packets they don't have a

129
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">physical thing but that in that</font>

130
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:15,870
progression from wires to virtual

131
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,000
circuits two packets each time the

132
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,180
inevitability and the acceptability

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,850
looks obvious because virtual circuits

134
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:28,460
made the conversation at least a

135
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:32,730
thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> times cheaper and IP itself</font>

136
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:35,520
when you strip out everything it wasn't

137
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the beauty of the protocol just about</font>

138
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,620
any other packet switching protocol

139
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:43,889
would have done the<font color="#CCCCCC"> job</font>

140
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,229
except appletalk that was apart

141
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:47,550
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> apple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk almost any other</font>

142
00:06:46,229 --> 00:06:49,800
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> would have done it because</font>

143
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,169
packets are cheaper than circuits that

144
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,570
whole timing thing and set up actually

145
00:06:52,169 --> 00:06:56,490
made networking cheaper so this progress

146
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,880
of inevitability was actually a progress

147
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:02,630

simple yes it's just more bits in the

spend money inside your network to do a

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:51,120
and if you buy that equipment you're not

<font color="#E5E5E5">after a while the word</font>

your mindset<font color="#CCCCCC"> you will have forgotten</font>

234
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:18,720
because once you spend those millions of

235
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,850
dollars that will be an integral part of

236

your business<font color="#E5E5E5"> planning rather than a</font>

transition rather than a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little loop</font>

239
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:31,170
starts to look a lot more like a black

hole and if there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> any Hawking</font>

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:55,019
is that I'm like it's great as a piece

248

of slide where how real<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it what are</font>

the tensions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that produce uncertainty</font>

331
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,880
when given the choice what's the problem

332
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:07,560
where's the structural brokenness in

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,380
here well it's the last mile access

<font color="#E5E5E5">isn't it obviously it's the last mile</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Hell so that they only turn on v6 when</font>

339
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,610
the access provider delivers it then and

340

only<font color="#E5E5E5"> then will they prefer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

341
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,890
why aren't the access providers turning

342
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:33,570
it on I offer you some choices based

343
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,520
largely on what I've been hearing<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

344

various presentations each of these

346
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:41,850
choices has some credibility but let's

347
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,470
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice here let's be nice you're not</font>

348
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,230
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stupid because a</font>

349
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:50,400
trillion-dollar industry is not stupid

350
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:53,970
by intent we do employ extremely smart

351
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:57,860
people somewhere and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we do</font>

352
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:00,930
ultimately does have serious intent and

353
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,050
the serious issue here is not because

354
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:08,310
we're stupid lazy and uninformed we are

355
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:11,099
broke we are really broke and that means

356
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,619
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an awful lot of freedom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

357
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:17,520
engage<font color="#CCCCCC"> in risky ventures because we're</font>

358
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:21,270
broke so the regime here right now makes

359
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,459
v6 really really unattractive as an

360
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,680
investment because<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font>

363
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:34,500
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and don't forget your revenue margin</font>

366
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,840
say I've just got the v6 blue screen of

367

369
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:52,860
easily so this regime is horrible

370
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,590
v6 is a really unattractive business

371

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:03,990

could you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make v4 last forever well I</font>

money in novel and innovative services

401
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:10,350
like 1 900 and fax and used those

402
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,840
mountains of money to subsidize every

403
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:14,520
other part of their activity as what

404
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,429
vertical integration was all about

405
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:20,060
that's why collectively they were the

406
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:23,100
largest single enterprise on the planet

407
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:24,960
that's why AT&T was so big back in

time they go home if only they got their

433
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:42,459
money back so where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">invest in v6 they haven't got it but all</font>

they want it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so rather than looking at</font>

00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:49,889
life in<font color="#E5E5E5"> such a depressing way let's try</font>

437
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:52,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and look at it in a different way</font>

438
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:54,279
because I'm sure somewhere there in the

439
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,080
access carriage market someone is

440
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:58,299
preparing a PowerPoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide that looks</font>

441
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,799
a lot like this only<font color="#CCCCCC"> they didn't use</font>

442

443
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,940
fancy fonts because that's what makes it

00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:06,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">believable so what actually happens out</font>

445
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,440
there in the economy there are a whole

446

you're running a constriction point

because when you put in that CGN what

463
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:57,879
you're actually doing is rationing

that's the current play that is

<font color="#E5E5E5">happening in front of our eyeballs</font>

508
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:08,660
that's the current play that takes open

509
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:11,330
networks and hermetically sealed them so

510

<font color="#CCCCCC">that even the devices aren't open let</font>

accuracy and depressing inevitability

back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I was because we're trying</font>

that both sides over there in transit

and down there in your device they

how can you transition these access

carriage providers across into v6 how

527
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:04,950
can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that we all actually</font>

528
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:07,020
end up with one network that is open one

network that doesn't require permission

from every last NAT gateway on the

531
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,350
planet to work one network that allows

creativity and innovation from each and

every one of us one network that

addresses what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is appropriate a</font>

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:27,750
v6 network that actually allows you not

550
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:11,040
answer because right now point three

so let's have a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at some of these</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">challenges just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually make sure</font>

574
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:13,590
cars and everything planes and so on the

575
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,720
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my lifetime is similarly</font>

576
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,970
amazing I don't know where I'd be

577
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,160
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google I don't know where I'd be</font>

578
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,350
without GPS in my pocket lost somewhere

579
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,330
out there in Philadelphia those changes

580
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,629
have happened rapidly and quickly be all

581
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:30,419
because of deregulation and competition

582
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:32,510
but where are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we now stop trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

583
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,790
think of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet as an industry</font>

584
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:38,790
it's not shall we do v6 or shall we not

585
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:41,970
it's not as if this industry has one

586
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:43,830
view there are content providers there

587
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,540
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> carriage providers there are folk</font>

588
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:47,850
who build a<font color="#E5E5E5"> six there are folks who make</font>

589
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">cpes there are folks who make laptops</font>

590
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:55,020
there are folks who make iPhones etc etc

591
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:56,610
everyone is trying to compete they're

592
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,379
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to compete ultimately for my</font>

593
00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:00,300
money but they're competing against each

594
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:04,620
other as well they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to optimize</font>

595
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:06,840
their own<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective so every last</font>

596
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:11,129
approach is going to get explored by

597
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:15,899
this industry inevitably there is no

598
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:18,540
plan there is no plan there is no

599
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:20,160
monopoly telco saying everyone its left

600
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,020
now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go down this street</font>

601
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:27,180
because that's where we're going there

602
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:29,070
is no plan and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no regulator to</font>

603
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:35,370
tell us what to do either there's just

604
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:40,649
market pressures I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea how they</font>

605
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:44,899
will play out and neither do you no one

606
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:49,350
here has<font color="#CCCCCC"> any idea how they will play out</font>

607
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:51,510
that's the problem secondly i said i

608
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,429
talk about v4 address exhaustion so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

609
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:54,820
suppose<font color="#CCCCCC"> i better that's actually the</font>

610
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,830
second challenge and it's a bit

611
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:58,809
a ripper<font color="#CCCCCC"> too because the problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

612
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:02,168
we're not all running out at the same

613
00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:04,029
time here's a piña the blue line is

614
00:29:02,169 --> 00:29:06,960
basically the amount of addresses we had

615
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:09,100
left and that's time at the bottom

616
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,139
that's about a good a definition of

617
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:12,789
panic as you'll ever find all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

618
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:15,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">sudden when I Anna ran out everyone in</font>

620
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:18,909
addresses and so we gave out a

621
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,460
phenomenal amount of addresses in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

down to our last / a fine what<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

others<font color="#E5E5E5"> gee Aaron's got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 / eights left</font>

628
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:38,649
about yesterday you know at least all

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">the best squares fit and so on do first</font>

630
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:43,149
order polynomials do a weighted squares

631
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:45,008
fit and so on the answers are pretty

632
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:47,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple you're going to run out sometime</font>

633
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:51,340
I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually tell you approximately</font>

634
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:53,439
when in ripes case with its 3.91 / aids

635
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,019
it looks like right now you're going to

636
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,690
run out in june of next year it used to

637
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:01,139
be march but the Greeks have done you a

638

favor

639
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:06,500
send them a thank you card next time you

350 million folk with an appetite for

iPhones iPads androids and everything

651
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,430
maths and variability analysis blah blah

652

the rest of the world apart from<font color="#E5E5E5"> europe</font>

is going to run out way over then and if

<font color="#E5E5E5">you can persuade the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Greeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to really</font>

660
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:58,010
maths but what does it actually mean

661
00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:02,750
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think this industry has</font>

662
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:04,370
its quota of two-year-olds because you

663
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:07,160
really have a hard time with reality

664
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,530
sometimes I keep on seeing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> press and</font>

668
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:17,330
exhaustion is a sort of some time in the

669
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,100
future problem and sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

670
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,740
asia-pacific knowing that it's happened

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:25,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">i find this kind of weird because for me</font>

672
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:28,190
its history not a future so you know I

673
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:29,660
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of think this industry has a whole</font>

bunch of folk you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think well if it</font>

675
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:35,000
hasn't happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me it hasn't</font>

676
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:37,280
happening at all and all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden you</font>

677
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,060
don't believe it until it's actually on

678
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:44,000
you and what happens to others is other

679
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:47,409
people's problem it's a network guys

680
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,470
it's a network what happens to me

681
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:56,060
effects you what happens to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> affects</font>

682
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:58,820
me but you know this industry despite

683
00:31:56,060 --> 00:32:01,629
the fact it's a networking industry has

684
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:05,240
a massive credibility problem to itself

685
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:08,390
we create our own myths that mpls is

686
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,550
really good that VPNs are wonderful that

687
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,290
we can make this stuff work that we can

688
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:14,240
do routing systems that leap over tall

689
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:15,139
buildings and talk to applications on

690
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fly we</font>

691
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:21,050
create these myths and then believe them

692
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:23,180
reality<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a lot harder most often and</font>

693
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:25,520
those varying address exhaustion

694
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:28,820
timeframes have their own sets of

695
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:31,790
problems so let's explore them because

696
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:34,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">regional diversity is about to rear its</font>

697
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:37,010
ugly little head let's go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

698
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,689
black hole of death that transition loop

699
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,870
and actually look at each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

700
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,130
regions as they progress through if you

701
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:47,929
want more addresses in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the asia-pacific</font>

702
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:50,900
region<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a simple answer no or you</font>

703
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:52,760
can buy them or you can try but there

704
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:55,670
are very<font color="#CCCCCC"> few sellers out there so the</font>

705
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:58,310
basic answer is no so what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you going</font>

706
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,600
to do next year Apple believes it's

707
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,040
going to sell another two hundred and

708
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,929
twenty odd million of their devices

709
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:05,960
Android is going to sell another<font color="#CCCCCC"> X</font>

710
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:09,560
million of those etc etc the silicon

711
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,270
industry doesn't care they're still

712
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,520
going to produce the same volume and

713
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,080
more next year as this<font color="#E5E5E5"> year they're</font>

714
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,060
still on their way so what's the

715
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,340
industry in asia-pacific going to have

716
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:22,669

717
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,800
to v6 that's not going to work so hello

718
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:27,200
mr. CGN vendor I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ship are</font>

719
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,500
likely to ship me a truckload make it

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,670
two truckloads I'm getting desperate<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

721
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,860
then if you sort of drive it<font color="#E5E5E5"> through the</font>

722
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:35,570
next year the folk in Europe and that

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,719
set of businesses have exactly the same

724
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:42,310
problem because the basic answer is I

725
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:46,970
want more<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses dear mr. right no</font>

726
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:48,530
not able to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it no and all of</font>

727
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,840
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden they're exploring that same</font>

728
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:53,090
dark space of what happens when you

729
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,709
truly run out of addresses and have to

730
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:57,020
completely change your capital

731
00:33:54,710 --> 00:34:01,520
investment strategy inside your network

732
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:04,670
and start down this weird ipv4 forever

733
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:06,710
track and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you keep on playing it further</font>

734
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:09,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">and each of us are going to be exploring</font>

735
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:14,810
these things at different speeds and

736
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:21,850
different places one network one

internet one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google one service or not</font>

738
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:28,960
because all of a sudden things will<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:31,299
different very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different because of</font>

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,830
different market pressures each of those

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">places is going to start devising</font>

742
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:38,739
solutions because well good or not we

743
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:40,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">are very creative people we will solve</font>

00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:42,729
our problems day today because we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

to but will it actually result in one

746
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:48,550
network what's the rate at which those

747
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:51,730
differing trajectories actually creates

748
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:53,440
different outcomes in each region well

749
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:57,640
we still end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with one network as a</font>

767
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,740
the longer the transition the more

768
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,120
likely you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget that it</font>

769
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,540
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> meant to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a transition at all</font>

770
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,970
because at some point<font color="#E5E5E5"> you just lose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:03,100
consistency this is a net with a bunch

773
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,590
of folk who are continually distracted

774
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,910
by light and motion whatever comes in

775
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:08,830
through the door and flitters in front

776
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:12,250
of our eyes something else let's perfect

777

CG ends let's make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> LG's work we don't</font>

00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:17,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">maintain trajectory over long periods of</font>

779
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:21,150
time we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that kind of industry so</font>

780
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:24,700
how's the network gonna fair well badly

781
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:26,860
because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heading off in</font>

782
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,589
different directions<font color="#E5E5E5"> in ipv6 is going to</font>

783
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,750
recede off to the closer to galaxy

784
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:33,490
because the longer it<font color="#CCCCCC"> takes for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> less the</font>

785
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,200

<font color="#E5E5E5">maintain trajectory</font>

787
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,919
so this regional diversity actually

788
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:42,250
means you're never going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">this in an assured fashion that it's all</font>

790
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,150
going to be one<font color="#CCCCCC"> network at the end</font>

791
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,609
market pressures over extended period

792
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,920
are going to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it tough so that's the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">extent of how difficult this problem is</font>

794
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:57,510
it is mind-bogglingly hard so it's one

795
00:36:55,570 --> 00:37:00,220
of these if then kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of statements I</font>

796
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:02,619
like the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years I had a ball</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,169
hope you did too you look as if you have

800
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,770
open and accessible networking the

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,570
vibrancy of competition the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:16,180
come in with a new idea and sell it to

your peers just makes life exciting and

804
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:21,460
wonderful doesn't it we like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

805
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,200
customers love it<font color="#E5E5E5"> too as a customer I</font>

806
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:27,030
mean or of what you guys have put in my

807
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:31,049
pocket it's brilliant right I want more

808
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:34,380
so to our customers they want more too

809
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:38,380
but we need for that open accessible

810
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:41,260
networking not permission-based 1970s

811
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:45,270
greyness and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm sorry</font>

812
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,619
ipv4 forever is not an option for you

813
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:50,500
because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> option is only an option</font>

814
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:53,829
for the carriage providers to retain a

rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> gray ascendancy if you want</font>

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> different how are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we going to</font>

817
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:00,399
get there how we're going to make that

<font color="#E5E5E5">happen how we going to help the internet</font>

819
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:09,700
through this transition or at least not

820
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:13,540
stuff it up completely yeah I have no

821
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:16,779
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely no idea which is</font>

822
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:18,160
really sad but maybe I'm just as person

823
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,440
of a very small brain and maybe

824
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,890
somewhere out there someone's figured it

825
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:26,740
out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have you've kept it a</font>

826
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:29,348
secret from the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us because only</font>

827
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:32,259
point three percent of the network is

828
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:34,359
actually going anywhere useful the rest

829
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:38,760
is jammed in that transitional white

830
00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:43,210
space I have no<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fix this</font>

831
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:47,020
none and neither does anyone else as far

832
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:49,150
as i can see whether you go up to ygf

833
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,619
meetings whether you go to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> oecd</font>

834
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:56,230
no matter where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go even to the IETF</font>

835
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:58,480
you see confusion and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain amount</font>

836
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:02,520
of fear and<font color="#CCCCCC"> panic but you certainly see</font>

837
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,440
confusion what you don't see is clarity

838
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:09,099
so I can't offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> you solutions and I</font>

839
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,010
won't pretend to what I will do is give

840
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:13,390
you just a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thoughts that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

the folks staying here through<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

843
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:19,538
of you going home after<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog you might</font>

844
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,700
want to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about because I hope</font>

thoughts solving your problems isn't

847
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:33,940
enough in networking it's a network it's

not be one network at the end of this

857
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:03,039
not we built the 1970s deliberately

858
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:07,299
1980s in networking was a nightmare we

859
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:09,730
can do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and we will if we don't</font>

860
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:12,640
start acting together we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

861
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,680
common interest work in convergence with

862
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,529
local interest because it is a

863
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,899
deregulated market out there no one's

864
00:40:17,529 --> 00:40:22,630
telling you what to do you have to

865
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:25,420
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of you where common</font>

866
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:27,789
interest lies because if you don't we

867
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,589
won't have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet we won't have an</font>

868
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:32,470
open network we won't have a neutral

869
00:40:29,589 --> 00:40:36,430
network and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't have an accessible</font>

870
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:37,930
network for us or our children keep an

871
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,808
eye on the bigger picture it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

872
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:47,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">you it's not just North America it's</font>

873
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:51,369
everyone um there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> too many men in</font>

874
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">this industry way too many men why I say</font>

875
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:57,130
this is that after<font color="#CCCCCC"> watching my wife go</font>

876
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:58,839
through childbirth three times I have to

877
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,750
say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no woman would ever want pain</font>

878
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:03,430
prolonged pain is best experienced very

879
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:06,579
very shortly and gotten over with as

880
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:09,460
quickly as possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> why because pain is</font>

881
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:13,170
terrible and scarcity produces pain and

882
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:16,660
uncertainty so if you try and prolong

883
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:18,670
scarcity then all you're doing is

884
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:23,038
prolonging pain and prolonging

885
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:25,990
uncertainty so the harsh lesson here and

886
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:28,750
I refer back to at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> three years of</font>

887
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:31,470
tortured policy discussions is that

888
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,690
scarcity and fairness are not synonyms

889
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:37,839
you can't be fair when their scarcity

890
00:41:34,690 --> 00:41:41,049
stop trying you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasting your time and</font>

891
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,808
prolonging pain and the longer you make

this industry suffer and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the longer you</font>

893
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:49,059
offer the illusion that v6 is something

894
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:52,119
I can defer to tomorrow the longer you

895
00:41:49,059 --> 00:41:54,640
increase the levels of uncertainty that

896
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:58,869
folk are going to build wacko solutions

897
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:01,868
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for themselves the longer we</font>

902
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:15,160
randomly uncertain all over the world

903
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:17,859
that's not a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so for my third</font>

904
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:20,710
thought I would actually say stop trying

905
00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:23,259
to ration out the last few<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses not</font>

906
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:24,640
only wasting<font color="#CCCCCC"> your time you're actually</font>

907
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:27,910
working against your own long-term

908
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,808
interest bring it on make it happen

909
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:33,279
because the faster we can get over this

910
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:35,680
the faster we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move on</font>

911
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:38,079
because the more time money and effort

912
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,029
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> distract this industry and offer</font>

address they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get their hands on I</font>

915
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:47,470
can defer v6 for another few hours the

916
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:50,020
longer you create<font color="#CCCCCC"> that diversion the</font>

917
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:52,029
worse it all gets all you're doing is

918
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,069
causing pain to your customers and a

919
00:42:52,029 --> 00:42:56,680
higher risk of yourself<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually losing</font>

920
00:42:54,069 --> 00:43:00,220
the plot the chances<font color="#E5E5E5"> are if you continue</font>

921
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:04,470
down this track v6 will be a fleeting

922
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,470
and we're all stuffed<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font>

923
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:16,090
now normally at this time I'd be tempted

924
00:43:13,690 --> 00:43:20,320
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> cut and run but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will take some</font>

925
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:22,120
questions and try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> defend them um</font>

926
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,690
thanks Jeff that's a great presentation

927
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:30,759
I have a really bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> question at what</font>

928
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:34,150
point would I said Bill Morton about at

929
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:36,370
what point would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say v6 has failed</font>

930
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:40,630
we need to work on something to replace

931
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:42,730
that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not an option</font>

932
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:46,510
for this industry at this point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

933
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:51,010
we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have time left we honestly</font>

934
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:54,340
don't if we lose the momentum of an open

935
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:56,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">network now the only thing that is going</font>

936
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,830
to recreate the environment we enjoyed

937
00:43:56,890 --> 00:44:03,640
the last time is a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology that</font>

938
00:43:59,830 --> 00:44:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a minimum of a thousand times cheaper</font>

939
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:08,200
per unit cost than the current one the

940
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,709
internet only took over telephony

941
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:13,899
because it was really really cheap if

942
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:18,040
you rebuild the walls of monopolies

943
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:19,840
around the current framework of v4 the

944
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:22,240
only way we're going to dismantle it in

945
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,280
the future is by some<font color="#E5E5E5"> super duper</font>

946
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,640
technology that is a thousand times

947
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:29,350
cheaper and guess what guys neutrino

948
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,259
based networking won't work in the

949
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:34,930
near-term future and I have no faith in

950
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,480
quantum networking so bill going

951
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:39,940
research have fun but don't make the

952
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,010
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us wait</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

953
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,770
that time and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to build</font>

954
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:47,890
instead I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we will regret I'm sorry</font>

955
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:52,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwagon is it's v6 that's all we</font>

956
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:54,670
have middle microphone there<font color="#CCCCCC"> drunker'n</font>

957
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,880
president/ceo<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron two quick questions</font>

958
00:44:54,670 --> 00:45:01,900
Jeff regarding your final couple of

959
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:04,990
slides the first one is you discuss it's

960
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:09,370
not worthwhile to try to conserve those

961
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:11,200
final addresses and I guess in Aaron of

962
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:14,710
course we we now are issuing them in

963
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,810
three month blocks I guess I'm wondering

964
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:19,450
if we were to issue them in 12 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

965
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:21,610
24 months would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually change</font>

966
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:23,740
anything because the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space would</font>

967
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:25,930
still be in the ISPs

968
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,310
it wouldn't be visible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron but it</font>

969
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:30,160
would still be being used for v4

970
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:33,210
services just not in a way that everyone

971
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:37,170
else would see is the appearance a

972
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:39,820
sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it worth considering</font>

973
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:42,130
personally yes I believe so that I think

974
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:44,619
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term death that you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

975
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:47,140
inside Aaron and<font color="#CCCCCC"> right or prolonging the</font>

976
00:45:44,619 --> 00:45:49,570
agony is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sending false signals all over</font>

977
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:51,609
this industry ok so my own view and it's

978
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:54,280
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very personal view is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just simply</font>

979
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:56,680
bring it on there is no alternative out

980
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,690
there rationing is a very strange

981
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,730
outcome as any economic theorists would

982
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:04,180
tell you once you start rationing a

983
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:06,880
resource everybody gets less than what

984
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:09,339
they wanted oddly enough in your effort

985
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:11,920
to be fair you pissed everybody off and

986
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:14,230
I'm sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not the most</font>

987
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,840
constructive outcome for us as an

988
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:18,160
industry so it's not Aaron doing this or

989
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,170
Aaron doing this don't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

990
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">all industry self regulatory measures</font>

991
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:26,560
but guys you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

992
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:29,050
entire picture not just trying to

993
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:31,299
perfect scarcity and perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

994
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,190
transition but beyond that so I would

995
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:37,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually say bring it on make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fast</font>

996
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:39,850
let it happen thank you Michael so not

997
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,310
Michael Sinatra yes net um thanks it was

998
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:45,190
another great presentation I'm when I

999
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:46,660
look at the part where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of circle</font>

1000
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,180
around for the transition and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

1001
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,609
of go off around the CD ends it makes me

1002
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:53,379
kind of think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work that van</font>

1003
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:55,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">Jacobson and others are doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1004
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:57,760
content centric networking an ndn and

1005
00:46:55,510 --> 00:47:00,580
the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting rid of addresses all</font>

1006
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,690
together is kind of interesting and I

1007
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,009
was wondering what you thought of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1008
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:04,480
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> you kind of answered it a little</font>

1009
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:07,030
bit when you answered bills question but

1010
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:10,060
do you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might end up kind</font>

1011
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:11,500
of if things go diverge well could we

1012
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,380
converge along something along those

1013
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:16,540
lines is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a possibility</font>

1014
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,369
architectural<font color="#E5E5E5"> II it's very possible but</font>

1015
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,820
it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business side of this you've</font>

1016
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:23,470
really got to worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Akamai</font>

1017
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:26,830
basically started populating the rack

1018
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:29,470
space inside ISPs and paid the ISP

1019
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:32,710
nothing because the ISP couldn't sell it

1020
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:35,740
any other way but<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a world of scarcity</font>

1021
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:37,930
all of a sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rackspace assumes</font>

1022
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:39,669
an incredible value

1023
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:41,799
and you could call it extortion at

1024
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:43,809
pricing but what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen is</font>

1025
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,750
those architectures will start to exist

1026
00:47:43,809 --> 00:47:50,829
and service providers will be forced<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1027
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:53,559
pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> an excessive onerous and dismal toll</font>

1028
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:56,410
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> life time that we've enjoyed in</font>

00:48:00,069 --> 00:48:05,400
shocking business model somehow we need

google that was a wonderful talk as

1035
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:15,430
always Jeff a couple of thoughts first

1036
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:19,420
of all you mentioned massive

1037
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:21,279
expenditures to implement ipv6 we

1038
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:24,010
haven't experienced that at Google it's

1039
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,829
taken time but it hasn't taken huge

1040
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:29,020
amounts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost so if you have I don't</font>

1041
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:30,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you could respond on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the at</font>

00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the moment and maybe it will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

1043
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:34,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something later to say</font>

1044
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:37,240
something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> why that's such a</font>

1045
00:48:34,569 --> 00:48:38,829
massive investment you think is needed I

1046
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,328
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions but</font>

1047
00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:41,950
I'll hold them until<font color="#E5E5E5"> you answer that one</font>

1048
00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:43,569
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the cost</font>

1049
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,129
right now is actually dealing with the

1050
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:46,839
help desk calls of customers they

1051
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,240
typically cost somewhere between 60 and

1052
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,920
65 dollars to answer with someone who

1053
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,569
speaks English<font color="#E5E5E5"> and vaguely competent in</font>

1054
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:55,030
this country and as many other countries

1055
00:48:52,569 --> 00:48:57,099
it's the same problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

1056
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:58,869
three or four calls and setting up v6

1057
00:48:57,099 --> 00:49:01,480
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just lost everything and that</font>

1058
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:04,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of cost one to two hundred dollars</font>

network it isn't even necessarily in

00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,849
doing the cpe it's all the ancillary

1062
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:14,950
costs of supporting folk whose passion

1063

isn't networking their passion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

sudden<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meter starts ticking that's</font>

1069
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,200
where the cost lives ok if it's firm

1070
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:31,750
permitted<font color="#CCCCCC"> may I ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple more</font>

1071
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,779
questions the other thing which strikes

1072
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:36,309
me as being on target is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> economic</font>

1073
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,530
arguments are the only ones that are

1074
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:40,589
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to win here and you've already</font>

1075
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">made the strong point that scarcity</font>

1076
00:49:40,589 --> 00:49:46,119
creates opportunity for the network

1077
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:48,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">suppliers there's an element of scarcity</font>

1078
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:50,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't remember</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you mentioned</font>

1079
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:51,609
that's the routing tables when we run

1080
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of those they start charging for</font>

1081
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:55,660
that

1082
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:58,060
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> becomes a big issue the question</font>

1083
00:49:55,660 --> 00:50:01,210
then is what economic arguments can be

1084
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:02,950
mounted that will persuade<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network</font>

1085
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:05,830
providers that their interest in

1086
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:08,350
scarcity should be overtaken by the

1087
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:10,750
utility of getting to a uniform<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">doing network we have to convince them</font>

1089
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:14,410
that it's in their economic interests to

1090
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:17,200
build the network we want not the

1091
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:18,940
network that they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they like it's a</font>

very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good question vent and one that</font>

1093

I've grappled with for many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't have an answer I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leaned</font>

1095
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,700
towards the theory that that particular

1096
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of the puzzle is what is</font>

1097
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:33,189
technically called a market failure

1098

we're open<font color="#E5E5E5"> economic forces actually</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">need various forms of intervention</font>

these folk will solve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem but in</font>

1107
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:57,040
ways that i think are weird perverted

1108
00:50:54,250 --> 00:51:00,070
and create an unnatural control over

00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:21,820
we're now inside a deeply technical area

oops with a deeply political or at least

1118

something constructive and it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

asking folk who are already gun-shy but

we do need more folk to look at this

from a wider perspective it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

else and our mechanisms to get through

00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:55,090
this I think VIN going to involve a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:59,319
more stakeholders than just the industry

the crux of part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you were saying</font>

is there's essentially this run out

people are running out at<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

start to create solutions inside various

cg ends like crazy because there are no

1184

their supply chains what they're asking

it's about hundred dollar per CP more or

proposition and you might well have gone

1243
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:15,430
a long way with it and then we had the

it might be a fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea but you go near</font>
