there we go hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone so I'm Neil</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Shelly with dine I want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font>

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,650
bit but a problem we were having this

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">year we were approaching some issues</font>

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:27,090
with one of our platforms just in terms

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:29,510
of binds<font color="#E5E5E5"> a load time be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> root I think we</font>

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:32,009
had about 110,000 zones at the time and

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:39,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately our servers were just taking</font>

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:41,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">over a long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a me up so</font>

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,140
at the time just starting that aren't

11
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,120
one of our name servers on this on this

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,460
platform take about 45 minutes and

13
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,899
sometimes longer which from an

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,879
operational standpoint was just really

15
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:52,770
annoying we would be sitting there

16
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,690
waiting to wat you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know watching it to</font>

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:59,520
make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when was really up it was</font>

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,959
it was up in our case that doesn't

19
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen terribly often but whenever we</font>

20
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,400
had some sort of patch or some sort of

21
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,290
reboot necessary for on those<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines or</font>

22
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,760
just regular maintenance it was it was a

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,850
lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> weight than it needed to be on</font>

24
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,619
our team and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we were also</font>

25
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,500
looking at importing a lot more zones to

26
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">this platform so whereas it was 110,000</font>

27
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,159
zones we had the potential of in

28
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,009
importing<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> couple hundred thousand</font>

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,159
zones soon and obviously future growth

30
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,450
is also useful so we were looking at

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,640
this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and trying to figure out</font>

32
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,390
what we can do about the name server

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,400
load times a couple the ideas that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:38,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">had come up with mounting the</font>

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,880
configuration in the zone files<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to</font>

36
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,020
their own partition with no a time set

37
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,060
we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple spots around</font>

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,610
our network already just anywhere you're

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,590
looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at loading a lot of files not a</font>

40
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:52,470
big files but just doing a lot of small

41
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,049
file access then that that's helped us

42
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,729
the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> in particular here was</font>

43
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,490
getting a little dated we were

44
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,860
approaching into warranty on machines it

45
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:03,059
was due for refresh and obviously just

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,729
buying new hardware is going to buy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,310
something on that new hardware we looked

48
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:11,680
at getting SSD discs because again

49
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,239
if we can make the actual loading of the

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">zone files a little bit faster would be</font>

51
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,099
worth it<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us and while we were</font>

52
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,290
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this the one of the more</font>

53
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:23,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things was that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> C sent us</font>

54
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:29,140
a note about a new patch that come out

55
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:31,030
and find 9981 so kind of got added in

56
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,089
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last second as one other idea we can</font>

57
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:36,940
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to really improve the load time so</font>

58
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,310
this patch had to do the link there is

59
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,709
to a blog post<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it but ultimately</font>

60
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,840
they told us about up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a ninety-eight</font>

61
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:46,269
percent improvement in load time which

62
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:51,100
seemed like kind of a big deal and it

63
00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:53,680
was so we started evaluating things I

64
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:56,530
hope I'm not surprising<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone too much</font>

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,720
by saying that the bind patch from ISC

66
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,690
really did work it was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-line patch</font>

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,519
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the other results I'll show</font>

68
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,530
both with and without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the patch because</font>

69
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,239
generally speaking they all improved

70
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,170
things but they also all improve things

71
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:13,780
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more with the patch so it with</font>

72
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,268
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> no anytime we looked at our servers</font>

73
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,640
like I said started off taking around 45

74
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,820
minutes to load just changing that mount

75
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,410
option on those on those partitions got

76
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,519
us about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cut down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the high 30s</font>

77
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,980
wasn't a huge improvement but what it

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,569
did help and the improvement would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

79
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,540
been a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more significant with the</font>

80
00:03:31,569 --> 00:03:36,488
patch<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so that was relatively easy</font>

81
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,929
that was painless that was free that's

82
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,280
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do</font>

83
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:40,480
if they just happen to be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DNS</font>

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,220
server that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really get a lot of</font>

85
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,380
love but happens to have a lot of zones

86
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:46,500
on it and you start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have issues with</font>

87
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,500
it

88
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,780
so the hardware platform this slide

89
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,570
seems to have gone off the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bottom here</font>

90
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,190
sorry about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so the hardware</font>

91
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,720
platform like I said we were using some

92
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,240
machines that were starting to get a

93
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,940
little dated they were dual core dual

94
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:09,270
dual core processors for gigs of memory

95
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:13,079
and aceite mirror for where they store

96
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:14,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">what they used for desk so we had been</font>

97
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">working on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not deciding some new</font>

98
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:21,270
platforms for some of our name servers

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we went with was a dual X 5650</font>

100
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,190
processors so<font color="#E5E5E5"> six scores each and the</font>

101
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,950
machines themselves had 12 gigs of

102
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:31,650
memory and we also like I said we were

103
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,990
looking at SSDs so they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a SAS</font>

104
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">disk just for normal use them and we</font>

105
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,400
also got an SSD in there to soar the

106
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,750
configuration on them so no real

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,219
surprise when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you upgrade the hardware a</font>

108
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,370
couple years more in the future things

109
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,620
go faster so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make a pretty</font>

110
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:48,210
good improvement just by that again when

111
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,340
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it in combination with the</font>

112
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:52,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">patch we were able to get even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

113
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,390
significant<font color="#CCCCCC"> improvements so you know now</font>

114
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,950
that 45 minutes that an engineer was

115
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,130
sitting there waiting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a server to</font>

116
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,260
load we could just with the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware</font>

117
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:05,780
upgrade we were down the 15 minutes or

118
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">so definitely a lot more preferable I</font>

119
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,440
hope I'm not surprising<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone to say</font>

120
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">that SSDs tend to be kind of fast so</font>

121
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,570
when we take that new hardware and we

122
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:17,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually use the SSD I you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> firt</font>

123
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,219
last slide was just using the SAS<font color="#E5E5E5"> disk</font>

124
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,599
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mayor so yes fast but made a big</font>

125
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,220
difference to actually swap over to the

126
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,250
SSD but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure is worth showing a</font>

127
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,500
graph for that but yeah now you've got

128
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,590
your disk access speeds a lot less

129
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,770
noticeable well and again load times

130
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,760
start going more and more down and that

131
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know the</font>

132
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:43,219
eight-minute range so already got pretty

133
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,830
significant improvements and finally the

134
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,050
98 that one patch so this was literally

135
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,150
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> one line patch to Bynes code and it's</font>

136
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">relatively easy to backport if you don't</font>

137
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,140
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity to upgrade right off</font>

138
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,340
the bat or<font color="#CCCCCC"> fist up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that holding you back</font>

139
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,930
to the 96 or 97 series the patch has to

140
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
do with the way internally<font color="#E5E5E5"> bind does</font>

141
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,470
some

142
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reading and internal task management</font>

143
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:09,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">had basically been hard coded at eight</font>

144
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,080
tasks at a time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would take care of</font>

145
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:14,359
whatever things the names ever had to do

146
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,949
with it any<font color="#E5E5E5"> moment so the actual loading</font>

147
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:19,010
of zones and all that stuff came into

148
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,510
play<font color="#E5E5E5"> nine that ate that one who has</font>

149
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:22,430
changed to an automatically calculated

150
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,889
value but you could also<font color="#E5E5E5"> just pick a</font>

151
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,090
number and if you picked a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

152
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:29,300
happened to be better<font color="#E5E5E5"> than you would get</font>

153
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,560
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> better improvement so I tested</font>

154
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,020
with a couple different<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers the the</font>

155
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,990
instructions in that blog post were

156
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:38,060
something alone lines of i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

157
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,400
for the number of zones you've got

158
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,479
divided by a hundred and then a slight

159
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,070
advantage if you pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a prime number</font>

160
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,930
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found just using any big number</font>

161
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:49,520
honestly made a really big improvement

162
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,169
so it didn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> so much that you</font>

163
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,289
picked the right number as much as you

164
00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,719
just moved it up for me so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

165
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:59,150
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the patch combined with all the</font>

166
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,160
different things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were doing just the</font>

167
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:02,690
old servers<font color="#CCCCCC"> hung raid like i said you</font>

168
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:06,430
see at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left starting in almost 45</font>

169
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,389
minutes the new servers using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SAS</font>

170
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,460
again you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an improvement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

171
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:11,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost uh well easily less than half the</font>

172
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,320
time just switching to the patched

173
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,660
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bind again a free upgrade the</font>

174
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,280
new servers with the SSD goes down from

175
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,060
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that eight-minute load time to</font>

176
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,400
think was about a minute<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifty and the</font>

177
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,979
last one I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just throw in there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

178
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,989
if you one thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> noticed with the new</font>

179
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,490
systems we've got with about 12 gigs of

180
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,800
memory they actually had enough memory

181
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,440
in them to store not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entirety</font>

182
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,760
of his own files but also the entirety

183
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,520
of the disk cache that<font color="#E5E5E5"> contained the</font>

184
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">zone files so when my testing</font>

185
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,880
methodology was going through them and

186
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,349
it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> started up named killed it</font>

187
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,380
started up named killed it and was just

188
00:07:45,349 --> 00:07:51,289
timing how long it took to start it made

189
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,000
for a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> comparison of just how fast</font>

190
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:55,789
it was bind was loading those zones

191
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,229
because the subsequent modes it would

192
00:07:55,789 --> 00:07:58,969
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything in disk cache it would</font>

193
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">never even bother reading this even if</font>

194
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,770
it was um SSD it was still fast or just

195
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:05,630
coming on straight memory so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gives</font>

196
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,280
you an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's exactly just the</font>

197
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,280
patch right there that that takes out

198
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,140
the disk subsystem entirely on the the

199
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,448
furthest to the right slide there so

200
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,800
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> that patch makes a</font>

201
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:18,529
big difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> and again it's a free</font>

202
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,240
upgrade you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can change one line in the</font>

203
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:23,719
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> code when you install it and</font>

204
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,330
you're good this is details about the

205
00:08:23,719 --> 00:08:27,860
the disk cache itself that just comes

206
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">with being able to have enough memory so</font>

207
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:31,129
that your disk cache doesn't get cleared

208
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,078
but it from a realistic standpoint

209
00:08:31,129 --> 00:08:36,919
that'll never happen in production from

210
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:39,169
a useful standpoint here it was good to

211
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,228
show just how much improvement is coming

212
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,110
directly<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that patch as opposed to</font>

213
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:49,370
otherwise the hardware improvements in

214
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:51,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a time improvements so anyway</font>

215
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,170
the conclusions we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were able to pick up</font>

216
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,089
at eleven percent just with<font color="#CCCCCC"> no a time so</font>

217
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:57,079
that was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the free ones combine</font>

218
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:58,670
that with a patch and you've got

219
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:02,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">twenty-five percent improvement in load</font>

220
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:04,010
times that alone was worth it just from

221
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,300
our engineers just sitting there

222
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:07,790
twiddling my thumbs waiting for name

223
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:10,130
server to load especially as we started

224
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,709
adding more zones these tests were<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

225
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:16,010
done loading almost 200,000 zones from

226
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:18,229
one of our platforms so you know it that

227
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,399
43<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes just to sit there it was kind</font>

228
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:24,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">of painful but dropping that down to</font>

229
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:27,230
let's be about 33 minutes I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

230
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:29,630
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> two options</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alone and you've at</font>

231
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,670
least made a pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> big dent the new</font>

232
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,870
hardware if you've got aging hardware

233
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,550
and it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> time to upgrade anyway</font>

234
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,959
then yeah again you get a big

235
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,310
improvement combine it with the patch

236
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,420
and that improvement becomes even more

237
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:43,310
significant SSDs helped a lot but in the

238
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,260
end you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes just all those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

239
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,050
we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring that load time</font>

240
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,670
from well from<font color="#E5E5E5"> that 48 minutes to I</font>

241
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,949
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a best time about a minute 50</font>

242
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,329
seconds and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the exact</font>

243
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:55,579
same thing it just happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing</font>

244
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:58,760
it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster for relatively little</font>

245
00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:00,500
investment so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

246
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,430
any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions but ultimately that yeah</font>

247
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,430
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was pretty helpful</font>

248
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:17,829
questions for Tom Neil sorry looked

249
00:10:12,589 --> 00:10:17,829
right at you<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks a lot deal</font>
