162
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:30,189
segue into a little bit about the

163
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,500
network connectivity because as those of

164
00:08:30,189 --> 00:08:35,319
you were here two years ago we hosted

165
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:38,379
nanog we did we the internet

166
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:40,750
connectivity 100 gig into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the I think</font>

167
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:42,188
we're at the Marriott and it took a lot

168
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,900
of coordination to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that hundred Giga</font>

169
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,520
it was pre standard

170
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:49,569
but it was a you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a true router</font>

171
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:52,960
interface across optics at distance that

172
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:55,600
was two years ago and today we still

173
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:58,720
have trouble getting acquitted gig out

174
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,850
at a cost effective scale so a message I

175
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,950
want to send to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vendors and Dave's</font>

176
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:05,560
going to Dave neck so he's one of those

177
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,480
vendors is really to remove I think

178
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,390
we're moving too slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> we you know</font>

179
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,880
hundred gig i think is late<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need it</font>

180
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:14,860
we needed it two years ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to</font>

181
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,250
emphasize<font color="#E5E5E5"> that with a few facts of</font>

182
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:21,730
things that we run so four years ago

183
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:23,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">within comcast if we if i added up all</font>

184
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:25,390
the ingress that we had coming into

185
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,810
comcast it equals one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our city to</font>

186
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">city pairs today where today we're</font>

187
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,560
carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> four terabits a second across</font>

188
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the core and then when it gets to the</font>

189
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,280
metro it doubles with regional based

190
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,510
services all the way to the edge we have

191
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,060
to double that infrastructure about

192
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,700
every 18 months as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine with</font>

193
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,500
that level of scale 10 definitely

194
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,600
doesn't cut it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> d</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bailey cuts it</font>

195
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,960
again we needed we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100 gay two</font>

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:52,450
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago if we take and extrapolate</font>

197
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:54,490
some of that that standard growth path

198
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,950
at the internet seeing with a lot of

199
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">high volume content our city the city</font>

200
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:01,870
link pairs will be in the five to six

201
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,939
target range in four or five years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as</font>

202
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,890
we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at how do we really</font>

203
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,480
drive the industry what I encourage a

204
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,770
lot of the folks here a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

205
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,990
operators that deal with a lot of

206
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,850
traffic is to look three to<font color="#E5E5E5"> five year</font>

207
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,470
plans understand what your needs are

208
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,050
going to be and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure you help drive</font>

209
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:19,120
the vendor community to deliver on on

210
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:22,150
some of the futures<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the internet</font>

211
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,530
needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle really with we need more</font>

212
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,980
than incremental change we need some

213
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:30,130
some some big pushes to outside the box

214
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,800
thinking okay I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get off my</font>

215
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,150
soapbox because again i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have five</font>

216
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes and probably already over that</font>

217
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:39,220
so really<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I want to say is you know</font>
