2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,990
always a tough act to follow so I'm

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,519
going to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit maybe a little</font>

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit different tact on this although</font>

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,540
people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably wondering again what</font>

00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">are we doing talking about economics at</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nano conference and the short answer</font>

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,820
for me is I decided to take a little bit

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">of time away from the industry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and do</font>

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,580
some graduate work at Seattle University

11
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:31,820
so being in network engineering for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:35,280
while and trying to blend the two had me

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,250
thinking a lot about how could I try to

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,100
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by you know combining</font>

15
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,040
what I was learning with what I knew<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:48,059
since there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot of literature or</font>

17
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,219
a lot of overall thought about how the

economics underlie this this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,390
attempt<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to bring light to an area</font>

20
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more at least on a on a basic</font>

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,709
level so my goal for this talk for

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,019
everyone here is that we at least just

24
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,990
start thinking about how these

25
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,420
principles sort of affect us because

26
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:13,530
they do affect us in pretty much

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,259
everything we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the money that flows</font>

28
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,360
around this industry is large and it

29
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:21,570
affects<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything we do and when we</font>

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,650
push against the economic principles

31
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,990
behind it it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard if you're a</font>

32
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,780
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> person or you're a small company</font>

33
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,880
and you can control all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inputs and</font>

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,689
outputs then it can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier but when we're in this massive</font>

36
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:42,889

industry pushing against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers is</font>

38
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:51,149
really hard so a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the brief</font>

39
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:54,420
history of how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got to the market for</font>

40
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:59,310
ipv4 addresses and dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with scarcity</font>

41
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,369
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is mostly recap but for a</font>

42
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,450
long time we've used need as our measure

43
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">of who should get address space and over</font>

44
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,119
time that became<font color="#CCCCCC"> RFC's and the rars were</font>

45
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,040
formed

46
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,870
and the policies have changed and

47
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,390
morphed over time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have five</font>

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,510
separate<font color="#CCCCCC"> rars now producing different</font>

49
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,339
policies somewhat coordinated but

50
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,329
largely independent in each of those

51
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:27,340
regions coming toward the exhaustion

52
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:29,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we saw coming up we develop</font>

53
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,700
policies for the exhaustion period for

54
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:36,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">the transition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> period and those in basic</font>

55
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,149
understanding was<font color="#E5E5E5"> while we needed to</font>

56
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,060
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort of market to deal with</font>

57
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:46,660
the exhaustion phase how to reallocate

58
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,470
some portion of the resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> to where</font>

59
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:53,379
they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> go or might be best used so</font>

60
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:57,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of a market was allowed and we</font>

61
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:59,590
are starting that to allows some

62
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,420
underlying economics to affect where

63
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,870
address space goes in the post

64
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:06,640
exhaustion period so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the pros</font>

65
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,940
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cons of a market just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a really</font>

66
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,200
simple perspective for ipv4<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the</font>

67
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,599
pros are we going to bring economic

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,500
forces into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the arena we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to let</font>

69
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,679
money decide where address space goes

70
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,799
well that has some possible benefits it

71
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">has the ability to put address spaces</font>

72
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,280
into organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

73
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:33,760
them to generate services for people the

74
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:36,970
big con that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see from this area is</font>

75
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:42,179
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has the potential to perhaps</font>

76
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,180
delay or maybe even deter v6 adoption

77
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,720
I think as Jeff was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about you</font>

78
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:02,550
know if we don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how the</font>

79
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,810
market is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to affect us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term</font>

80
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:09,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the transition the market mindset</font>

81
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:12,510
that will just be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to solve our</font>

82
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,790
problems by using a market puts us into

83
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,969
a position<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we don't get the</font>

84
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:20,880
outcome that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> desire they're sort of</font>

85
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,980
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a caveat that chopping up into lots</font>

86
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,060
of little blocks has some consequences

87
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:29,280
for network engineering lots of people

88
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,090
talked about the routing table how real

89
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,469
a problem it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> or isn't well when we</font>

90
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,020
get to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll have to figure it out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

91
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:40,770
guess but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> consequences to</font>

92
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:42,630
chopping things up into little blocks so

93
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,580
what do we know about the ipv4 market to

94
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:46,560
date well there's one very large

95

<font color="#E5E5E5">well-known transaction that came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

100
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,310
yesterday released the list of all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

105
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,250
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what blocks went</font>

106
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:23,520
where and from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my math there's about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">three / six teens in addition to the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">microsoft transaction that have been</font>

109
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:32,820
traded since the directed transfer

110
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:35,760
policy went into effect so not a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

111
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:39,570
spaces<font color="#E5E5E5"> moved around but some spaces</font>

112
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:41,219
moved around so what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in the</font>

113
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:42,900
market well there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> address brokers that</font>

114
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,340
are forming there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of</font>

115
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:47,940
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that see a potential</font>

116
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,770
commercial opportunity here and on this

117
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,650
slide there's one of them who has

118
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,570
graciously decided to list their bid and

119
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,270
ask prices on the front page of their

120
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:59,250
website and as you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here I have</font>

121
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">no way to verify what if these are</font>

122
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:03,510
actual bids or actual offers but if

123
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,550
they're posting it publicly it would

124
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,530
seem that they're probably pretty

125
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,730
serious about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what these prices are</font>

126
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:12,380
underlying

127
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:14,540
so what about demand from an economic

128
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,460
perspective well this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> history of</font>

129
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,970
how much address space were been

130
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,039
consuming over the past 15 years yes

131
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,100
it's up<font color="#CCCCCC"> and to the right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are using</font>

132
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:27,949
more address space every year and we've

00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:30,380
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it for a long time and it's</font>

134
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:33,560
based on what we know it's probably

135
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to continue in that way and you</font>

136
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:39,919
can see here the asia-pacific<font color="#CCCCCC"> region has</font>

137
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:45,320
really been driving the usage of address

138
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:47,150
space in the past five years well one

139
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,060
day I was thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> that last chart</font>

140
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:52,130
and thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what what</font>

143
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,070
out and I graphed it against that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,489
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the annual rates and graph them</font>

145
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:06,440
against world GDP and you got something

146
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,220
that was well up into the right a little

147
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:14,060
bit and somewhat correlated so to some

148
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:17,720
extent this makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense right people are</font>

149
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,700
getting more services more mobile

150
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,250
devices are going out there more address

151
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:25,190
spaces basically from my perspective

152
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,260
what does this mean it means as we get

153
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,270
richer as as people we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to need</font>

154
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:34,340
more address space and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

155
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:38,090
to change over time so what about

156
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,979
employment deployment incentives well

157
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,320
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my bar chart of what it costs to</font>

158
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:49,120
deploy ipv4 and what it costs to deploy

159
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:51,740
ipv6 and for this I took five categories

160
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,340
reliability what the hardware<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

161
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,940
software costs people training support

162
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,580
and the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space since we're</font>

163
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,460
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv type II address</font>

164
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,789
markets so and every one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

165
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">categories except for address space I</font>

166
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:13,849
believe the cost of deploy I pv6 today

167
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,340
is much larger than ipv4 and so what is

168
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:18,380
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is that telling us it's</font>

169
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,210
telling us that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go beyond</font>

170
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

171
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,479
look at how we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> put ipv6 out there</font>

172
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:29,000
now in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the economic literature</font>

173
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,849
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman called harold</font>

174
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,760
hotelling who did some work in the 1930s

175
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:36,770
about exhaustible resources and

176
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,159
specifically he was looking at oil

177
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:42,380
reserves and his postulates was that we

178
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:44,839
wouldn't transition to a new technology

179
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,750
or a new resource until the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

180
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,120
old resource exceeded the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

181
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,990
new resource so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that look like</font>

182
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,589
in terms of ipv4 and ipv6 so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

183
00:08:53,990 --> 00:09:00,770
graph showing ipv4 and ipv6 over time

184
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:03,080
and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> for illustrative purposes we</font>

185
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:07,339
started with ipv6 being twice as

186
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:10,550
expensive as ipv4 and over time ten

187
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:13,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ten percent down for ipv6 and ten</font>

188
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:18,099
percent up for ipv4 this is sort of like

189
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:21,470
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> best-case scenario in my opinion that</font>

190
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 becomes into its being it becomes</font>

191
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,200
cheaper over time and ipv4 becomes more

192
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">expensive it becomes less desirable for</font>

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,940
people and that can help us move forward

194
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">into a world where ipv6 is allowed to be</font>

195
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,010
a big part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the one network that we</font>

196
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,560
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some other</font>

things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US economic</font>

198
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">principles well there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of talk</font>

199
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,040
about substitutes in some of the

200
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:51,020
economic literature and a substitute is

201
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,000
something that you would choose one over

202
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,130
the other the best well-known one in

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,079
court a common literature would or

204
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,540
common practice would be coke or pepsi

205
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:05,599
and taking your personal preference

206
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:09,579
aside<font color="#CCCCCC"> there a beverage of choice so if</font>

207
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:13,130
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at that for ipv4 and ipv6 today</font>

208
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:15,949
ipv6 is not a perfect substitute it's

209
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:19,040
more expensive it doesn't do the same

210
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,110
thing and you can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk between</font>

211
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,800
the two networks without the transition

212
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:26,660
technologies another element in there is

213
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,819
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a network effect and</font>

214
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,860
network effect is basically the more

215
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,360
people that you have on one network the

216
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,220
more valuable it is

217
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,810
the more<font color="#CCCCCC"> people on facebook makes</font>

218
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook more valuable to each</font>

219
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:41,250
individual person if you're on Joe's

220
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,829
social network it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not very valuable</font>

221
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:47,190
because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only six of you there so</font>

222
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:49,800
all of us are<font color="#E5E5E5"> on v4 right now and ipv6</font>

223
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,269
is largely a<font color="#CCCCCC"> green field so it's not as</font>

224
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,670
valuable there's there's a network

225
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:56,339
effect going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there that is making</font>

226
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:59,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">before seem more valuable than it is and</font>

227
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:01,140
in order to push toward v6 we have to

228
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,410
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at sort of how that goes underneath</font>

229
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,970
those and the other big elephant in the

230
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,439
room of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is NAT and we've talked a</font>

231
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:10,399
lot about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in terms of carrier-grade</font>

232
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,010
NAT and how that might impact our world

233
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,260
but unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> from an economic</font>

234
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:19,950
perspective NAT is a pretty good

235
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,240
substitute for ipv4 small scale<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

236
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,519
we've seen this in the home environment

237
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,519
for a long time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

238
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,100
been allocating before addresses to TVs

239
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,230
and all sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the home for</font>

240
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,899
four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you policy even permits</font>

241
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:36,959
this but we haven't done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

242
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,860
chosen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the cpe model where we do</font>

243
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,689
not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind a single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address that</font>

244
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:48,060
allows<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to share one address per</font>

245
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:50,279
household so what about the market

246
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,170
itself what are the dynamics well first

247
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,000
of all the ipv4 market is never going to

248
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> perfect competition it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never going</font>

249
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,800
to be that perfect supply and demand

250
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:02,040
graph because they're switching and

251
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,050
transfer costs the supply in the market

252
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,329
is limited we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to</font>

253
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,160
operate our networks as they are there's

254
00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:11,670
some efficiency we can pull out but

255
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:14,550
there's not an available large supply

256
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,890
from what we can see as we looked at

257
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,079
earlier demand is continuing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> grow so</font>

258
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,870
demand is continuing to increase even in

259
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,790
the background so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a really</font>

260
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,589
complicated chart but I was trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

261
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:29,279
illustrate something about efficiency

262
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:32,370
here so at the top left hand corner you

263
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,560
can see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RIR run outs in the pink and</font>

264
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:38,070
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> red and we sort of get to that for</font>

265
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,290
simplicity purposes in 2012 for this

266
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:43,620
graph and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying to myself</font>

267
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:46,860
well we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not we're not totally used up</font>

268
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,720
every address<font color="#E5E5E5"> space if we got to exhaust</font>

269
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,480
there's some efficiency that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get</font>

270
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,640
in terms of you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some</font>

271
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,730
address space in the corner that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

272
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">being well used or we found some over</font>

273
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:02,160
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we could put somewhere else</font>

274
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:05,540
in a better way so if you say we're

275
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,310
about seventy percent efficient in 2012

276
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:11,640
that leaves us with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the brown line which</font>

277
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:14,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">is about 850 million addresses that are</font>

278
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:17,910
sort of sort of available but locked up

279
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:21,060
in existing organizations now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we drew</font>

280
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,370
that down over time how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long would it</font>

281
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,500
take for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do that at the current</font>

282
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,900
growth and demand curve that we've been

283
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:31,740
seeing and while that takes just two

284
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:34,380
about 2016 before we've gone from a 74

285
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:38,730
sent you deficiency<font color="#E5E5E5"> utilization to a</font>

286
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:41,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred percent utilization so then we</font>

287
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:44,130
have some the purple purple blue that

288
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,680
moves up into the right that's sort of

289
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,830
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> after we run out of v4 we got to</font>

290
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,069
put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto v6 so that's the number of</font>

291
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:55,400
addresses that we deploy in v6 after we

292
00:13:53,070 --> 00:14:00,480
run out of this one hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

293
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:03,000
efficient v4 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> lastly on this chart</font>

294
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,970
there's this kind of light blue line

00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,030
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> starts about 2015 and moves up to</font>

297
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:15,959
you use this model to show how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many v6</font>

298
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,689
addresses get get put in as a percentage

299
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:23,130
of v4 addresses if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

300
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:25,830
demand numbers meaning about 250 million

301
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,800
addresses this year and growing at about

302
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:31,080
ten percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> per year so that says that</font>

303
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:36,120
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> about twenty twenty or twenty twenty</font>

304
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:38,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">one fifty percent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all addresses and</font>

305
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,980
use on the internet would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be</font>

306
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:43,939
ipv6 if we let the current demand

307
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,940
numbers continue

308
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:50,750
so one other area of economics is called

309
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,060
game theory and game theory is about how

310
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,130
organizations make choices in their

311
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,410
environment and perhaps that can help us

312
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,920
understand a little bit about what's

313
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:03,600
going on in our industry and one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

314
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,969
common games that you talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

315
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,430
coordination game in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

316
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:10,649
different payouts for different

317
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:13,969
organizations depending on what choices

318
00:15:10,649 --> 00:15:16,170
they make in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our industry it might be</font>

319
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:18,600
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at in terms of what</font>

320
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:20,849
would happen if you adopted a specific

321
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,240
protocol and if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about this in</font>

322
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:29,420
terms of a minor gonna adopt<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 rd or</font>

323
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,459
dual stack light or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that</font>

324
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,370
these are commonly written in this 4 by

325
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,229
4 matrix where you have these outcomes

326
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:39,029
and on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide the blue represents a</font>

327
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,370
competitor a<font color="#E5E5E5"> and B represents a</font>

328
00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,439
competitor B or earth and the red

329
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,300
represents competitor be and there are

330
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,440
different outcomes in terms of profit

331
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:51,240
that occur based upon what different

332
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:54,149
competitors choose and in this case if

333
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,510
both adopted protocol be that would be

334
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:59,730
better for<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone but if one chose to</font>

335
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:02,010
adopt one and the other chose to adopt a

336
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,770
different protocol it would be worse<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

337
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,689
both of them and so in some ways I see

338
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:08,939
this is sort of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with the v6</font>

339
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,579
transition because we don't sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of have</font>

340
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,880
a clear path forward in in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

341
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:17,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology for transition you know</font>

342
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,500
there's too many options what are we

343
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:25,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing what is the plan that we have you</font>

344
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:28,410
know in terms of could we all agree in

345
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:31,170
some way that one was the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font>

346
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,939
forward I know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard in a</font>

347
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,520
competitive environment but maybe that's

348
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,930
the best way the problem with standards

349
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,649
is that there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> too many to choose from</font>

350
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,449
and in this case I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> true we</font>

351
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:46,649
need to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how we can coalesce</font>

352
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:49,849
toward a plan that produces a possible

353
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:52,589
outcome that's good for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone and</font>

354
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,220
perhaps we're delaying adoption because

355
00:16:52,589 --> 00:16:59,149
we can't come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a plan that</font>

356
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">everyone seems to find</font>

357
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:06,709
palatable from from a long-term

358
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:09,270
perspective and in other ways we look at

359
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:12,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea of an economic commitment and</font>

360
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:15,930
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a side topic but the large</font>

361
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,420
provider was to basically say I'm going

362
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">to choose this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as my method of</font>

363
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:25,050
transition that<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be a way</font>

364
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">to move the industry forward if a large</font>

365
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:31,620
provider chose to adopt one protocol as

366
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:33,900
a transition it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the effect of</font>

367
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,719
getting everybody on the bandwagon and

368
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,750
moving to our single destination so

369
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,500
lastly three hypotheses about what could

370
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:47,250
happen here in terms of from an economic

371
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:51,090
perspective so one could say<font color="#CCCCCC"> large-scale</font>

372
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:53,160
adoption of v6 won't occur until the v4

373
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,990
exhaustion is complete well it's almost

374
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,790
seems inevitable at this point<font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font>

375
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,530
where we are but this would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an</font>

376
00:17:56,790 --> 00:18:04,710
application of the scarce resource

377
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:06,420
rundown model finally a number to the

378
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,340
transfer prices and different reasons

379
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,340
are going to vary due<font color="#CCCCCC"> to different rules</font>

380
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:14,059
different supply and demand and

381
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:16,740
different restrictions and

382
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:20,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">inter-regional transfers could change</font>

383
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:24,420
this could affect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> marketplace but</font>

384
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:26,510
this has the possibility of affecting

385
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:32,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transform transfer price market</font>

386
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:34,530
third how much is an IP address worth so

387
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,440
you could do it some modeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a</font>

388
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:40,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit a couple models that I came</font>

389
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:44,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">up with show the price</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be about 150</font>

00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:46,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">to 1,100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US dollars per IP address</font>

391
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,240
there's a paper link at the end of the

392
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,780
slide deck<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can figure out how i</font>

393
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,790
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> those numbers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a IP</font>

394
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:57,629
address in a manner that is what

395
00:18:53,790 --> 00:19:00,420
required to be unique such as hosting or

396
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:03,840
some sort of specific uniqueness

397
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:07,230
requirement so what's the conclusions

398
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,820
real quick economics are part of our

399
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,750
life so we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> aware of how</font>

400
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:15,899
they're affecting us and

401
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,900
how we can deal with this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> situation</font>

402
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,950
just understanding it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us make</font>

403
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:24,669
better decisions overall in the long

404
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:27,400
term and economics can change over time

405
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that's that's possible when</font>

406
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the rules change in the game we can</font>

407
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:35,429
change our environment and perhaps turn

408
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,810
the economics toward our advantage so

409
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:41,080
looking at what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do as engineers</font>

410
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,909
operators<font color="#E5E5E5"> policymakers to change the</font>

underlying infrastructure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

412
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:51,130
underlying cost models can benefit<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

413
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,380
industry by allowing us to promote the

414
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:58,480
adoption of v6 and potentially get

415
00:19:53,380 --> 00:20:01,900
ourselves out of this situation we're in

416
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:04,800
so that's us so I'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> some questions</font>

417
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,800
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't</font>

you or seem to be focusing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on cost and</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the only economic factor in</font>

00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:12,980
cost isn't sometimes isn't even the

432
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:18,960
dominant factor sometimes revenue is and

433
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:23,490
so how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that play into all of what</font>

434
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:26,700
your your economic model so i would say

435
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:31,669
economic<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs of course is the dollars</font>

436
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:34,140
but it's also opportunity cost so

437
00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:37,740
there's the non dollar component of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

438
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:39,510
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of revenue i think we</font>

439
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">are in an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area where revenue is really</font>

440
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,970
restricted and that does have an effect

441
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:48,510
on how you could model some of these

442
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:51,390
things out I didn't specifically spend a

443
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:54,720
lot of time looking at that from a

444
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:57,090
long-term perspective but it could be

445
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,630
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at how we could</font>

446
00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:02,279
change perhaps the ability to move

447
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:04,559
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward if the revenue models</font>

448
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:07,919
were different in the cost the way we

449
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:12,049
were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to produce enough revenue to</font>

450
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,049
offset the cost of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the transition</font>

451
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,820
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much push it</font>
