group of forward-looking individuals ask

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,360
the question why doesn't Pennsylvania

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,550
have a statewide research and education

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,760

issues with collaboration between state

agencies public and private concerns and

31

always ownership and control so when the

33
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,869
so this group here sorry about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

not have any electronics sorry

147
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,840
strategy is to build out the backbone

looking forward to implementing some new

deployed hasn't been deployed at all in

197
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,880
some places yet so one of the things

198
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:51,790
that's new about the the kimber network

199
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,020
is the fiber selection it's a OFS true

200
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:58,510
wave reach fiber it has some some pretty

201
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:01,030
advanced capabilities we expect it to be

202
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:04,240
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perform well for a very very</font>

203
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:05,680
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and to be able to increase</font>

204
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,630
the bandwidth on it as technology

205
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:13,449
improves dramatically over existing

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">fiber selections so we went over this a</font>

207
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,740
little bit that it's a member-based

208
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,060

partnership with advil optical and

214
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,680
juniper networks to build the network

00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:42,670
each one of those segments is forty

eight strands total of sixty nine sites

219
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,089
that includes those access nodes that

<font color="#CCCCCC">going and the most exciting part is that</font>

223
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:56,410
as GM pls develops we fully intended to

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the most exciting part to</font>

places are a little bit challenging

229
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:12,280
because of the desires of various

230
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,020

requires multiple pairs to be used

can move resources around the network

00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:10,290
without having to move jumpers around

274
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:13,260
and make other changes but it helps us

actually two different paradigms

00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,089
depending on the distance we're looking

280
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:30,420
at any particular link in some places

281
00:13:27,089 --> 00:13:32,010
will have<font color="#CCCCCC"> gray optics fed into a</font>

everything will be on ipv6 so GM pls

314
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:55,199
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting again I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

321
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,610
is standards complaint and that's how

322
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:17,150
we'll have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Juniper gear and the</font>

integrates into that what nicely as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

328
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,330
so again everybody knows you know how

329
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,580
mpls kind of brings the benefits the

330
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,500

343
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:16,830
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to do is protect against</font>

344
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,570
isolation of any particular node and we

345
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:21,300
want a 50 millisecond recovery time

346
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:23,700
because that's the golden recovery time

347
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:27,569
that sonnet has trained us to want right

348
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,860
so but how can we do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with zero</font>

349
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,120
additional<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs right we want to be</font>

350
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,650
able to put all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in without having</font>

351
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,540
to put in a whole bunch of extra optics

352
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,920
and a whole bunch of extra lambdas

353
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:39,449
across the network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're reserving</font>

354
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,650
bandwidth for this so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> too this is</font>

355
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:43,110
kind of a scenario and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> fits</font>

356
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,240
together in this case there's two core

357
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,020
routers with GM pls that are talking to

358
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">the optical network and it's a failure</font>

359
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:53,460
scenario where there's 25 or cuts in the

360
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:55,439
network so first we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is just</font>

361
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:57,030
our example network it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

362
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">similar network to what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> penryn will be</font>

363
00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:02,189
building of course our first regular old

364
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">path through the network goes through</font>

365
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:08,040
the top sets of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rodin's and the backup</font>

366
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:09,300
path is through the bottom the LSPs are

367
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,970
built across that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's your</font>

standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast reroute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> scenario the dash</font>

line is just your your your standard

370
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:22,230
mpls LSPs so we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> our first cut cuts</font>

371
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:24,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">the top fiber just like again in</font>

372
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,970
standard fast reroute traffic just flows

373
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:31,050
across the back of LSP but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then what</font>

374
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,760
happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> when we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the second cut in</font>

375
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,840
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases we would be down for some</font>

376
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,250
period of time until someone got a

377
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,600
chance to look at this and most networks

378
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:38,970
depending on how you've architected it

379
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,429
but in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these cases we're running GM pls</font>

380
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,380
we now signal or<font color="#E5E5E5"> across from the Juniper</font>

381
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,120
router or any whichever router it is up

382
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,950
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network to build a new optical</font>

383
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,300
path through the network to support this

384
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:53,220
traffic new path is built and entropic

385
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:59,040
begins flowing across that path again as

386
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:01,230
it did before repair scenario it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

387
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:04,320
of the reverse of that once the first

388
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:07,190
cut is repaired still<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't use the the</font>

389
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,720
LSP because the endpoints are still<font color="#CCCCCC"> busy</font>

390
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:11,610
we have to get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second cut to be</font>

391
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,970
prepared and then the traffic is moved

392
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:18,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the to the LSB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too and make before</font>

393
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">break planner then the old LSP is torn</font>

394
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:23,270
now in the optical LSP and we can

395
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:25,679
recover back to the way we were before

396
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:27,780
so kind of an example<font color="#CCCCCC"> that here's where</font>

397
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:32,350
we left off

398
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:33,820
11 link is repaired the the link is

399
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,389
noticed to be back<font color="#E5E5E5"> up by the optical</font>

400
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:41,679
gear and it turns that link back up

401
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:44,530
notifies through<font color="#CCCCCC"> G</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mpls second link is</font>

402
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,080
repaired that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is then notice the LSP is</font>

403
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,940
rerouted back across that<font color="#E5E5E5"> path now that</font>

404
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,770
that's working we tear down the the

405
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,190
temporary LSP that we had through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

406
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:56,290
primary the old about the third path

407
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,570
right that we created<font color="#E5E5E5"> through G mpls</font>

408
00:18:56,290 --> 00:19:01,450
that returns to normal and then we have

409
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">back into the initial state where where</font>

410
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,340
we have our standard fast reroute set up

411
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:09,340
again this is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> brand-new stuff this</font>

412
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,810
is completely in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lab so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far the</font>

413
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,720
network is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still under construction</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

414
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:15,790
we're anticipating that these features

415
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,040
will be available<font color="#E5E5E5"> at or near around the</font>

416
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:20,770
time that we're turning up kind of maybe

417
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:22,960
the third and fourth paths through the

418
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:25,150
network so we can utilize this initially

419
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,800
as the network is built you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there's</font>

420
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:29,350
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only a limited amount of fiber</font>

421
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:35,860
so we're thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time lines</font>

422
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:38,409
converge nicely yeah so so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the</font>

423
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">point is is that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can have all</font>

424
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:42,730
this recovery in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network without</font>

425
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,189
installing additional interfaces without

426
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:48,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to build a completely third path</font>

427
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,870
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network which which gets our</font>

428
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,770
costs way down and increases our

429
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:55,300
reliability and of course as in standard

430
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,310
mpls each service node in the network

431
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,370
the active equipment nodes are capable

432
00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:04,179
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> policy-based mpls stuff across</font>

433
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:06,909
the network you all know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and this</font>

434
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,370
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a summary of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the features that</font>

435
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:11,010
we expect to implement in the network as

436
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:14,860
they're available from<font color="#CCCCCC"> advan juniper</font>

437
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:19,690
again not discussing dates yet but we'll

438
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:21,520
get there and so I know as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

439
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,990
improved manageability and the improved

440
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,180
performance of scalability and reduced

441
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:27,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost of the reasons that Kimber and Tori</font>

442
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,550
point work together to choose this model

443
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:32,080
and I'm hoping that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know by the next</font>

444
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,450
nanog will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bits of this</font>

445
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,189
implemented in the program committee

446
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:38,290
will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us coming back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

447
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,650
give an update on what worked and what

448
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,649
didn't

449
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:49,030
yeah anybody have any questions mics are

450
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,940
open please identify yourself in your

451
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,639
affiliation dan<font color="#CCCCCC"> migori and Johns Hopkins</font>

452
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:57,060
Applied Physics lab has gone good um

453
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,440
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> so are you you're so you're using</font>

454
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:01,540
directionless as well as colorless right

455
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,640
proper your your restoration right

456
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,530
correct well we will but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the plan</font>

457
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,520
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> though this is built yet right</font>

458
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:11,620
now so your timers on GM pila is you

459
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,870
know your time for GM pls restoration is

460
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,459
a lot longer than your timers on the

461
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,689
protocols of course so you you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

462
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,550
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a route you know an</font>

463
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,480
outages it's not none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that's 50</font>

464
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,159
millisecond stuff so you know what's I

465
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,540
guess you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll come back pretty</font>

466
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,980
quickly but it's not going to be

467
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely transparent things will</font>

468
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:31,540
bounce right so yeah you you may very

469
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,100
well be right we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't</font>

470
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:35,290
gotten that stuff into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lab yet to</font>

471
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,230
see what we could get the timing to be

472
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:39,850
like so right hopefully by the next

473
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:42,400
netlog<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might have a good answer that</font>

474
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,740
sure and on 100 Gig are you building

475
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,630
that on separate stuff without decomp

476
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,640
and then your 10 gig network is with

477
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:50,230
decomp or you kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of trying to put it</font>

478
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,350
all on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same one and because normally</font>

479
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:57,070
with 100 you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> use become so</font>

480
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:59,679
um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's still to be determined</font>

481
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,480
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we're still we're still</font>

482
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,610
working through exactly how we're going

483
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,970
to do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so yeah don't know yet</font>

484
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:09,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thanks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right mics are closed on</font>

485
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,340
this side uh yeah Mon lady hurricane

486
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:15,880
electric you talked about using aerial

487
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,679
fiber<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus underground fly but can you</font>

488
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,030
talk a little bit about what you expect

489
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:24,340
quality wise on on you know 10 40 100

490
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gig type services when you could</font>

491
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">potentially get movement on that fiber</font>

492
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,080
is that is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a concern for you guys</font>

493
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take that</font>

494
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:42,899
um that's a great question I don't think

495
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:46,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm really able to answer that certainly</font>

496
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:48,180
try to talk you offline about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I think</font>

497
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,470
I think I mean from my opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you</font>

498
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:53,210
know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the standard answer of</font>

499
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:55,980
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ariel is going to be less reliable</font>

500
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:59,640
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network layout that will have</font>

501
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:02,040
and GM pls restoration on top of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

502
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,190
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we'll be able to mitigate</font>

503
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,580
some of the risk much worried about

504
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,990
actual cottage and you know truck taking

505
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,199
it out for example I'm more interested

506
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,840
in dispersion and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know sort of</font>

507
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,500
movement of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fiber and which has been</font>

508
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,070
a concern at 10 gig and above oh I don't

509
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:27,960
know guess we'll find out yeah leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

510
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:29,730
for some homework boy yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay</font>

511
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">with that we're right on time so bright</font>

512
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,929
brian brandon thank you
