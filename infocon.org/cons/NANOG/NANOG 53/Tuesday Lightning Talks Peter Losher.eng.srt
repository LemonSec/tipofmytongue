00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:10,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet systems consortium and I'm here</font>

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,750
to talk about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little incident that</font>

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,920
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 days ago so first I'm</font>

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,210
going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a little bit of an</font>

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:24,269
overview so that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate is he</font>

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,199
operates one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 13 DNS root servers</font>

8
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:32,968
out on the internet but we globally any

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:37,290
cash to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the service from as3 557 we are</font>

10
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,739
at over 55 sites worldwide and for those

11
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:43,890
nodes are what we consider global nodes

12
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:46,828
where asp 557 actually doesn't pier with

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,950
anyone directly anymore but we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have what</font>

14
00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:52,949
we call management a esas so in the case

15
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,980
of the global node it's fully within a s

16
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:57,629
1280 which is our wide area network

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,169
which if you're in North America

18
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,539
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> your are appearing with the</font>

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,500
remainder<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these nodes are considered</font>

20
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:09,330
local nodes and so the concept of a

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,270
local node is that we're serving a local

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,090
community whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a Nyack's network</font>

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,960
access point or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in a small</font>

24
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,240
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> in st. Africa the major telco we</font>

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,380
restrict the traffic be via the no

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,449
export bgp community string and for each

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,380
one of these local nodes we have a per

28
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,930
node specific management<font color="#CCCCCC"> AS which then</font>

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,990
peers with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the either the route server</font>

30
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:38,850
or appears directly with participants so

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,610
you see if you're looking at the route

32
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,149
path you're seeing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s3 557 our</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">peer on that particular IX or nap or a</font>

35
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,759
route sir group as the case may be we

36
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,179
tried to drat drive traffic wherever

37
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,579
possible to a local node we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:01,860
various reasons we want to disperse<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

39
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,600
DNS traffic as wide as possible and get

40
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,600
it closer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end users wherever</font>

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,940
possible so say someone in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bangladesh</font>

42
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,079
doesn't have to to query their traffic

43
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,320
and have it go all the way to California

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,760
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit Hong Kong or or if we had</font>

45
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,640
were in our case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have a</font>

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">local node into kha and the traffic</font>

47
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,079
should just stay inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country this</font>

48
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,600
also has other benefits in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cases of</font>

00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">D doses and so forth as have been seen</font>

50
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,370
over the years where we've been able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

51
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,560
mitigate the traffic by spreading it

52
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:35,410
over several local nodes rather than

53
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,920
have all the traffic trunk over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OC</font>

54
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:43,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">over the Atlantic or the Pacific to our</font>

55
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:47,369
global modes so we tried we do that by

56
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,770
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> we prepend r.a.s several times</font>

57
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:55,780
from our global nodes so you'll see like

58
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:57,670
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> s12 a s12 AAS 1280 and to make sure</font>

59
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the local nodes always have a</font>

60
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:02,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">shorter path so if you want more</font>

61
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:04,120
information about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we do have a blog</font>

62
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">post that my colleague Leo becnel wrote</font>

63
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,250
that explains this in a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

64
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,820
detail we also on the global nodes

65
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,730
advertise covering / 23 instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 24</font>

66
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:21,549
and that / 47 to cover those edge cases

67
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:23,859
so no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is left behind so a little bit</font>

68
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:27,720
about effort<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Beijing we actually</font>

69
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:33,910
operate two instances of<font color="#E5E5E5"> F in in China</font>

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,680
we've been there since about 2004 one is

71
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,329
sponsored by AP neck that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one</font>

72
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's been there the longest we</font>

73
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:43,830
recently turned up another one back in

74
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:48,100
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> summer which is sponsored by CN deck</font>

75
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:50,950
we operate the service but we the local

76
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,140
sponsors usually cover colocation and

77
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,600
handle network connectivity and and so

78
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,929
forth but I FC directly operates still

79
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,380
operates the service both of these nodes

80
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:04,989
have connectivity to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national telcos</font>

81
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:06,940
and research and educational networks so

82
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,070
we have access to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> china telecom</font>

83
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:15,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">china unicom you name it they have their</font>

84
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:20,320
own dedicated management asses so at PK

85
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:23,909
one we're at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> s 23-7 those 07 and NP a</font>

87
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:32,940
up streams of say<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s 3557 at those</font>

88
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:36,480
locations the PK one is still just ipv4

89
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:41,520
direct ipv4 only the other is dual stack

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:45,150
ipv4 and ipv6 and in PE k1<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

91
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,490
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the Beijing nap and PK two</font>

92
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:51,510
were actually hosted by CN neck and then

93
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:55,230
they export our routes over to to the

94
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,240
telcos and research networks so in

95
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:59,040
traffic in traffic numbers actually

96
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,830
Beijing is one of our largest local

97
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:08,160
nodes so what happened on October the

98
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:12,570
first at the time indicated there was a

99
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:16,380
leak of our ipv6 network block from PE k

100
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:20,580
2 to the ipv6 internet at large<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

101
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:23,340
leaker right originated from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a s3 3794</font>

102
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,200
for which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> China science and</font>

103
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:28,229
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network basically an are any</font>

104
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,289
network actually was easy to find out

105
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:36,270
because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently our only v6</font>

106
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:40,650
beer so the leak propagated from that a

107
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,390
s 2 a 2 hurricane over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hong Kong</font>

108
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:46,739
internet exchange and then from

109
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:48,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">hurricane to the world so is he was made</font>

110
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,010
aware of the issue about 24<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours later</font>

111
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:56,010
and once we verified the attack or a

112
00:05:52,010 --> 00:06:00,810
very verified the leak we pulled the

113
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:06,539
ipv6 announcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> straightaway and nanog</font>

114
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:11,430
goes wild so there was a nice long long

115
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:14,220
thread about this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to to</font>

116
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">clarify some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues some issues my</font>

117
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,840
colleague<font color="#CCCCCC"> Leah ilio bicknell addressed</font>

118
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:22,200
some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> already but just to point</font>

119
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,549
out there was no rewriting of answers we

120
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,640
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> checked this before we actually</font>

121
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,740
pulled the route there's no there was

122
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,349
any traffic that came from that

123
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">particular location wasn't getting</font>

124
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:37,910
rewritten by the Great Firewall of China

125
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,770
and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth and the other fact</font>

126
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,740
is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually affected less than</font>

127
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,659
0 point 0 point four of our global

128
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:49,790
traffic flows now granted this is

129
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:51,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">partially because it's ipv6 but the the</font>

130
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:52,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">other point is maybe you can say we've</font>

131
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,610
actually made some progress because at

132
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,790
ipv6 day everyone was chomping at the

133
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:01,480
bit that we got point<font color="#CCCCCC"> point2 of global</font>

134
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,950
traffic so hey we've made an increase

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,530
but in the particular case this is

136
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,760
basically mostly of global traffic if

137
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,590
you are actually appearing with us

138
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly at any one of our other local</font>

139
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:14,090
nodes where we already had<font color="#E5E5E5"> b6 where we</font>

140
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:15,860
already had a v6 session enabled in that

141
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,859
particular case you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would be most likely</font>

142
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,840
using that node anyway because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a s</font>

143
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:25,460
path<font color="#E5E5E5"> web and shorter than this then then</font>

144
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,200
the leaked a s path to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Beijing and we</font>

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,780
have seen no sign that there was a

malicious intent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to divert traffic</font>

147
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,830
someone's sticking a hijacked route or

148
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,690
or anything like that this looks to have

149
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,849
simply been<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone stripping</font>

150
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:40,219
accidentally stripping out<font color="#E5E5E5"> our no export</font>

151
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:44,060
and propagating the route to their up

152
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,650
streams and in fact we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually deal</font>

153
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,360
with about handful of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> every single</font>

157
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:56,780
and you find the routes gone halfway or

158
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:58,730
circled the world at least twice but

159
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,609
that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> we take very seriously</font>

160
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:06,200
and we investigate and we and it's

<font color="#CCCCCC">usually take taken care of so some</font>

162
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,090
takeaways from this there needs to be

163
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:14,539
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and better bgp monitoring</font>

164
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:16,729
especially with ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean we'd all</font>

165
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:18,590
like it if we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get bgp monitors on</font>

166

every a s and have a complete view of

167
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:24,469
the world but obviously that's that's

168
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,680
likely not possible we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

169
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,990
various options ourselves whether or not

170
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,450
we use something we've been talking with

171
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,799
ripe about doing some stuff with<font color="#E5E5E5"> atlas</font>

172
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:39,080
as a possible mechanism there may be

other other<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP type services that we</font>

may may may investigate in future

175
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:47,390
obviously we'd like more ipv6 peers

wherever possible

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:55,630

relatively flat and basically for ipv6

it's usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes but I have provider</font>

183
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,780
least a little bit more diversity so so

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,290
you say seems completely reasonable the

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is really straightforwardly</font>

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:45,219
and it's genuinely a question because I

215
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:48,079
don't understand why do root name server

216

too far and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a question</font>

over at that at that point now as we've

promise you their shenanigans going on

in fact the Chinese government<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

250
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,720
promised you and they've explained what

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:20,120
those shenanigans are and you've chosen

252
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:21,950
to pick those as you're up streams<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

253
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,990
so if this weren't a country if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you had</font>

political question i'm not saying

260
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,060
that you know the Chinese people don't

261
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:39,040
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a right to fast reliable name</font>

263
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:46,599
have a right to not have your answers

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:49,180
rewritten we make every effort wherever

265
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,220
possible thank you we make every effort

266
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,689
wherever possible I mean other thing is

267
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:56,080
is that we tried to keep the local

268
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,240
traffic local wherever possible and so

269
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,200
we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the no export once we find a leak</font>

270
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,870
we investigate and pull it at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

271
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,790
the day the end solution and I'm going

272
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:09,760
to sound like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a broken parrot is that</font>

273
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,589
DNS SEC needs to be applied at that

274
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,420
point you don't care where the bloody

275
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,310
answers come from as long<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you can</font>

278
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:24,400
there's also the issue of all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

279
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:26,890
sudden my 80 milliseconds got routed to

280
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:28,900
300 milliseconds the DNS infrastructure

281
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,370
will sort of self clean because it will

282
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:32,949
find a closer name server that will

283
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,710
there are 12 other root servers out

284
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:40,480
there they'll deep<font color="#E5E5E5"> pref us and go do</font>

287
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">last question then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I left a Godwin this</font>

288
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:49,360
thread all I was going to say I'm Jim

289
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,000
Martin with ISC as well the bottom line

290
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that we are providing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a network</font>

291
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,020
service we're not making any judgments

292
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,700
about what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> right or wrong in any</font>

293
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,930
country we don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's our</font>

294
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,550
place to be making a decision about

295
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:02,020
what's right or wrong because just

296
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,490
because we believe one thing doesn't

297
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,680
mean that that's the appropriate thing

298
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,320
in every environment what we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe</font>

299
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,540
in is providing the clean route

300
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,760
everywhere in the world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

301
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:15,069
because we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's something</font>

302
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:18,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that is fundamental for the growth of</font>

303
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:19,750
the internet and so it I think the basis

304
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:21,580
of your question<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

305
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,990
assumption that what they're doing is

306
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,040
wrong and we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not prepared to make</font>

307
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:28,630
that assumption so I will we get the

308
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">guillen asses track if you want to</font>

309
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">continue this further yeah yeah taken</font>

310
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:33,790
you were waiting patiently we have time

311
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,260
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the for the one more you were</font>

312
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:39,800
waiting like I actually have a fairly

313
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:43,170
quick technical question and actually

314
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,399
richard barnes BBN so you mentioned two

315
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:46,680
things you mentioned that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took about</font>

316
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,930
24<font color="#CCCCCC"> hours before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys became aware of</font>

317
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,640
the change in the routing here and that

318
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,469
you deal with several similar events

319
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,360
every year so I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering if you</font>

320
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:56,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">could comment on whether the delay here</font>

321
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,720
between the change in the routing and

322
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,459
your awareness and reaction to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

323
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,790
typical how that compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

324
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:10,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">events you typically handle um well part</font>

325
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:12,750
of it was is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was weekend and so</font>

326
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:17,850
I mean this is discussions we're having

327
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,560
internally 24 hours was a bit long so as

328
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,410
far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're concerned so we're looking</font>

329
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,359
at measures to try to it and at in this

330
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,790
particular case<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also a very slow</font>

331
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,279
drip it was v6 we were only seeing a

332
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">very small section of our traffic</font>

333
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:33,750
getting rerouted but<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seems</font>

334
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,939
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a route route detection</font>

335
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,640
change where all of a sudden all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

336
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:41,010
global v6 traffic is diverted to China I

337
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,110
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have probably are diverted to a</font>

338
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:47,689
particular location should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have thrown</font>

339
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:47,690
up a red flag so thanks
