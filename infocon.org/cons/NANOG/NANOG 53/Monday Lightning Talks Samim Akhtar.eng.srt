grafton guys are this is Chevy<font color="#CCCCCC"> mokhtar</font>

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,700
let's do some little teamwork over here

3
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:14,730
first of all welcome<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Philadelphia our</font>

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">hometown over here and I had a quick</font>

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">question for all of you is a trivia</font>

6
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:22,189
question how many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could have our</font>

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:27,539
juicy Philly cheesesteak this lunch

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:28,800
great great great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm sure next couple</font>

9
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,810
of days will be a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for you to</font>

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,750
at least not be the deprived one and do

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,180
back at home as well the next question

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,280
for the carrier says how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you</font>

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">have not taught with a hundred years</font>

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,450
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet good looks like if everybody</font>

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,550
has tried on a gig in some form or

16
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:50,239
somewhere or the other so with that I

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:53,459
would start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the topic of discussion</font>

18
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the fact that you know a smooth</font>

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:01:00,390
landing of technology requires some

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,019
level of expectation for our technology

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,380
partners we do expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to be working</font>

22
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,180
on certain set of rules and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

23
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:12,080
only applicable to 100k it's applicable

24
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,640
to any technology lifecycle you know so

25
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,860
the certain items probably know most of

26
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,020
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> always keep thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that you</font>

27
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the requirement which are our</font>

28
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:23,548

00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:26,189
getting are they getting in all in one

30
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,500

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,299
need and when we need that versus in

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,430
peace peels and I think we as carrier

34
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,960
definitely are in driver's seat in terms

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,350
of you know giving the end-to-end

37
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,509
is specific to the fact that we want on

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,490
a gig by this date we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

articulate the use cases which not only

captures the details around the network

41
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,339

45
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,280
carrier who is constrained by fiber

46
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,350
needs to have spectral efficiency that's

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,090
one use case but all the use<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases I</font>

48
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,310
have no space and power I<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have</font>

49
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,430
higher density and I do have 100 gig on

50
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:15,620
my routers or switches today

51
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,840
or likewise<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just do not like the</font>

52
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,700
connectivity story so far and it's very

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,920
expensive on you guys need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix that</font>

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem so of course you know different</font>

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,689
standard bodies we do participate on

56
00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:29,000
that and we tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dry some of the</font>

57
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:31,519
technologies but we as a carrier

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,469
definitely tend to have a good level<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

59
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:41,689
good sense you know of control over<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

we can say for every use case is

64
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,739
applicable and that's what I called you

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,040
know smooth lining of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh</font>

00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:57,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's talk about 100 gig it's a four</font>

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,450
there a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Fullerton would all of that but</font>

70
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:04,430
the question here is that when you talk

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,810
about you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know optimizing the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hanukkah</font>

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,040
optimizing in three different angles

74
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:12,530
there you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there was a need for a</font>

75
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,629
spectral efficiency and there was a good

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,370
place for<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovation to come in some</font>

77
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:18,620
proprietary dual carry on a gig came in

78
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,629
then the first generation and now comes

<font color="#E5E5E5">the second generation part of it some of</font>

80
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:25,429
the limitation was around asics are you

81
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:27,829
know the GSP part of it the CMOS solve

82
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,790
some of the problems the soft fake is

83
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:31,069
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this is all good stuff</font>

85
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:34,698
of it to whatever extent it good you

86
00:03:33,349 --> 00:03:36,198
know their limitation in terms of

87
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:40,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">shannon's sampling theorem we understand</font>

88
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:42,199
that but under the constraints we have I

89
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:45,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of going the right</font>

90
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:47,090
direction based on the fact that<font color="#CCCCCC"> oif</font>

91
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:49,790
together with itu<font color="#E5E5E5"> took over the</font>

92
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:50,750
challenge to do this time the photonic

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,470
and the line size a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

94
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,060
differently when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you talk about the</font>

95
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:57,739
vertical axis over here the mac

96
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:59,689
efficiency I think that's pretty

97
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,489
relevant it's getting very relevant for

98
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:02,720
the carrier like us who do triple play

99
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:04,370
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know triple play means we do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,019
triple<font color="#E5E5E5"> and quad play on the same</font>

101
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,489
infrastructures you have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> converged</font>

102
00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:09,500
network and that's true pretty much for

103
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:11,180
all the carriers day by<font color="#E5E5E5"> day where you</font>

104
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">know you tend to have one operation</font>

105
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,519
model against infrastructure what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got</font>

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,759
so again the smooth<font color="#CCCCCC"> landing expectation</font>

107
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,010
for that was if the moves law is really

108
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,219
applicable and is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty well on a</font>

109
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mac efficiency you know you would rather</font>

110
00:04:24,219 --> 00:04:29,990
have the asics coming in

111
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:33,410
and the right form factor and you know

112
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:35,900
if we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a baseline as a</font>

113
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,610
honey JJ sake or honey<font color="#CCCCCC"> gig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mac so of</font>

114
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,820
course that<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some hiccups yeah</font>

115
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:43,520
there's a gap between what gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> released</font>

116
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">the press and what comes in as a</font>

117
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,930
deployable technology that gap needs to

118
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:49,700
shorten and I think we as a carrier play

119
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,130
a big role in terms of level setting as

120
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:55,550
to what we need and what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that press</font>

121
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:57,350
release mean to me to us there are

122
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,460
complexities in terms of upgrades once

123
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,220
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have great our switches and routers</font>

124
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:04,460
we always have a big planning that goes

125
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:05,870
on to play as to you have the RG use the

126

revenue generating unit hooked<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the</font>

127
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:12,260
infrastructure and any outage even for a

128
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:14,150
half an hour is a big deal for us it's a

129
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,670
quality of<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience impact what we</font>

130
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,679
call a scorecard and and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> if that</font>

131
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,810
outage happens and a large scale of 15

132
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,420
millions of customers definitely has its

133
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:26,480
own own impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the fundamental</font>

134
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:28,670
architecture in terms of handling the

135
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,010
migration or a great path is not the

136
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:34,190
important constraint connectivity

137
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:37,580
connectivity has been a pretty trivial

138
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,860
piece of work historically being done in

139
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,229
a one gig 10 gig space but the honey gig

140
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:44,990
brought a new paradigm in terms of how

141
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can solve that problem and how</font>

course<font color="#CCCCCC"> I triple did a great job to begin</font>

fundamentally broke the whole cost curve

148
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,500
what we see in 10 gig space where things

have stabilized<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can exchange we kind</font>

155
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,469
that problem went to a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 tried</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that still trying it but the same time</font>

157
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,280
there was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing inherently there</font>

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:23,990
which most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> carrier's probably</font>

159
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,239
would appreciate the fact that the whole

<font color="#E5E5E5">multi multi mode active cable space</font>

161
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,750
which could have fixed any<font color="#E5E5E5"> person or for</font>

162
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,909
use cases as a low-cost

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,980
interconnectivity between the router and

164
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:36,410
transport which did which we didn't pay

165
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:39,380
attention to on the right time where you

166
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,510
had the standard bring develop a couple

of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> back but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> however you know</font>

168
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,740
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really execute upon that in a</font>

169
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,390
timely fashion and now we are party six

170
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,920
or nine months late in terms of having a

171
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,620
right connectivity or low-cost

172
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:53,120
connectivity for ourselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> so of course</font>

173
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:56,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they see three dimensions over</font>

there<font color="#E5E5E5"> 400 gag you need to land all these</font>

175
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,610
three areas of flexibility at the same

176
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,109
time so that's a function of time right

177
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,810
and that's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things which</font>

178
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,390
probably be carriers have a lot of heavy

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,820
lifting lifting to be done and probably

180
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,700
you know what I'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> too is that kind of</font>

181
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,770
talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a perspective about what how</font>

182
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,450
we can fix things in a terabit space if

183
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:19,250
you talk about terabit morning talking

184
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:22,849
brocade pretty good and terabit looks

185
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,590
pretty awesome but the same time we kind

186
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,210
of know the fact that 400 gig is a

187
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,859
pretty linear thinking you know we have

188
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,719
bill of material of what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and</font>

189
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,160
400 gig is going to be a reality even if

190
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,990
you don't want to take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right but</font>

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about a one terabit</font>

00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:49,640
you know we have respite you 2015 17 but

00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">I tend to agree about respite we had a</font>

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,710
respite knowing the fact we can linearly

thank and bring your honey gig out we

200
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:58,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about a terabit I think we need</font>

201
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have some out-of-the-box thinking we</font>

202
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,540
need to bring some thought process which

203
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,479
is not limited to just electrical domain

204
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:08,600
io speed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the circuit board we need to</font>

205
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,700
have full a bill of material or totals

206
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,260
TC of analysis in terms of how the end

207
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,770
to empower space and cooling needs to be

208
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:18,380
optimized at the same time the whole MLD

209
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:22,010
approach what we have and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole you</font>

210
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,380
know 25-yard gig vs our project which is

211
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,940
coming along I think it's a path towards

212
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,480
a good path towards for honey cake but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

213
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,940
think thinking beyond a terabit<font color="#CCCCCC"> Minister</font>

214
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,409
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I call that a terabit I do not call</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">it a bit by any means at the end of the</font>

217
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,280
story and that story of course needs

218
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:41,870
some you know fundamental chain thinking

219
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:44,630
in terms of how the MLD is being done

220
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:46,790
the multi-lane distribution fiber site<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

is always there super channel is going

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,040
to fix some of the problems the

224
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,620
temporary relief but the same time I

225
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have you know bigger challenge</font>

226
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,480
in terms of the

227
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,070
whole network architecture we had

<font color="#E5E5E5">morning session with Dave and Eve talked</font>

229
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,730
about the fact that I know application

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a network network complementing the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">done we carry understand the pain about</font>

234
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:12,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that if you empower the content</font>

235
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:14,180
providers a content developers to be

236
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
creative in terms of steering traffic on

237
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,439
the network we should be doing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

238
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,939
thing knowing the fact that an

239
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,250
application is running how each week on

240
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:24,080
network but they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> not collage they</font>

should<font color="#E5E5E5"> complement and that complement</font>

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,760
means a good bit of collaboration with

<font color="#E5E5E5">fix that problem early in the stage so</font>

246
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,480
that we can dampen the bandwidth XO

dampen the the one side spectral

249
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,949
efficiency concerned we have so we're

trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to elongate the life of our fiber</font>

at the same time having<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that it</font>

252
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">doesn't undermine the fact that we don't</font>

253
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,719
need a bit we need a terabit for land

254
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,550
applications that is connectivity of

255
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,040
machines connectivity of switches and

256
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,819
routers so that's my two cents about you

257
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,230
know the efficiency of turbit and you

258
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:05,690
know when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this whole</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">standers effort which has gone on in the</font>

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:10,400
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we left the work of the</font>

land side<font color="#E5E5E5"> why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Tripoli itu and why fix</font>

262
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,060
some of the land side I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this is</font>

263
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,010
pretty disjoint having to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a</font>

264
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,709
piecemeal ownership is not productive

265
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:20,510
and with that I'll probably open up with

266
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,190
some questions and I have plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

267
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,990
details around each of this hard process

268
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,760
of most of the talks have given this

269
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,120
here so probably can take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that</font>

270
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,120
as well

very nice thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much any</font>

272
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:40,770
questions we are right up on the hour we

273
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:43,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">have done quite well here all right</font>
