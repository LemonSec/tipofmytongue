<font color="#E5E5E5">10 Dilbert we went to a fancy tropical</font>

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,979
and drank mai tais and not quite

00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:43,250
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> we were in beautiful fremont</font>

37

california in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a corporate office park ms</font>

38
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,270
thanks for hosting us by the way we were

39
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:49,549
in their conference room we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> did</font>

40
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,759
have coffee and sandwiches<font color="#CCCCCC"> unless</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

41
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:54,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">part was good we weren't there either</font>

42
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,350
just to have a good time we were there

43
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,149
to actually work we spent a whole day

44
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,759
locked in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this conference room except</font>

45
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:05,780
for the walk in the middle and talked

46
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,509
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nanog is going to become and</font>

47
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,100
we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that moment but the</font>

48
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:13,488
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest thing that we</font>

49
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:17,060
talked about is this why why does<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

50
00:02:13,489 --> 00:02:18,920
not exist what's our purpose in life so

51
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,190
here's the quick answer now that is

52
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,149
educational and operational<font color="#E5E5E5"> and whatever</font>

53
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:24,350
by the time I'm done explaining this to

54
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,079
my grandma that she's gonna be sound

55
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,280
asleep so this isn't a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good answer to</font>

56
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:31,190
why this is actually a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to</font>

57
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:37,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">what perhaps but why is a more important</font>

58
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:39,170
question there so the facilitator of

59
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,530
this retreat spent a good deal of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

60
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,570
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us and it really resonated</font>

61
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:47,260
about how successful organizations start

62
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:50,019
off by figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out why they exist and</font>

63
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,040
work from there to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is they do</font>

64
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:53,390
most times<font color="#CCCCCC"> there for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example if you go</font>

65
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,890
out and<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy a computer computer</font>

66
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:58,130
companies going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say hey we make you</font>

67
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,929
computers by some he used apple as his

68
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:01,250
example can take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

69
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:03,890
appropriate grain of salt but maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

70
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,450
week is appropriate Apple has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vision</font>

71
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,160
for what they build why they build

72
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,660
things the way they do and that's what

73
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:13,070
this meant to you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just cool</font>

74
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:15,770
hardware so he challenged us to think

75
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">about why we're doing stuff why does</font>

76
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:21,290
then I<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist yeah we all come to</font>

77
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,450
conferences and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> mainly lists and</font>

78
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:26,120
we have endless arguments about stuff

79
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,399
but there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that mrs. what</font>

80
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,290
came up with we are here collaborating

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,340
to make an<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet better that's</font>

82
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">something I can explain to my</font>

83
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,620
grandmother I can explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people who</font>

84
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,640
need an elevator<font color="#E5E5E5"> they won't be asleep by</font>

85
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,470
the end of the sentence and it actually

86
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,480
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them we come here</font>

87
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:44,959
together to exchange information and

88
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,760
knowledge drinks whatever but we're here

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">because doing so we believe makes engine</font>

90
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,940
it better that's a good reason that's

91
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:56,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's easy to articulate easy</font>

92
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,170
to explain and it motivates kind of the

93
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,430
rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole</font>

94
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,600
week if you ask me anyway so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it gets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

95
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,320
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> through treating a bit</font>

96
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,700
but when you move forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bit I'm only</font>

97
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">spending one slide on what we've done</font>

98
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:14,810
over the last 18 months since we started

99
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:18,709
this whole adventure<font color="#CCCCCC"> with nothing we got</font>

100
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:23,610
some initial donations and support lots

101
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:26,729
of advice and we worked with

102
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,770
our partners of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Merit to figure out how</font>

103
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,930
to separate ourselves and become an

104
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,549
independent organization we did that we

105
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:34,500
expanded the sponsorship model so we

106
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">have real money coming in we have a</font>

107
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,159
positive cash flow<font color="#CCCCCC"> addendum toiled about</font>

108
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,319
that little while but that's a huge

109
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,849
thing for us we weren't trick the

110
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,219
beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do that but we did and</font>

111
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:45,569
this here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Philadelphia is the first</font>

112
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:50,210
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done completely on</font>

113
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:51,990
our own that has pluses and minuses

114
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:53,520
sorry there might be a few rough edges

115
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,259
here hopefully they're minor ones and

116
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,490
you won't even notice them but on the

117
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,520
whole we're here there's a room there's

118
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,669
lights there's sound miss tables that

119
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,169
means that things are actually working

120
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:05,549
also wanted to thank those<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you who</font>

121
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:08,479
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> in registered at the last possible</font>

122
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,289
moment that's my additional revenue

123
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,029
doesn't mean total type in the back

124
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:13,620
there for which we apologize but you

125
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:17,759
know too many people is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad</font>

126
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:19,319
problem to have if you ask me I was

127
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,449
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up with a slider list of</font>

128
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,319
people to thank but started getting way

129
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:27,659
too long so<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> start by just thinking</font>

130
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:28,949
everybody became all of you you're the

131
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:32,699
members who the community you're the

132
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:36,360
reason why we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> here collaborating to</font>

133
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:38,819
make the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet better a few specific</font>

134
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,919
not people but types of people I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

135
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:44,250
call out there were the initial people

136
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:47,279
who SAT again with us and helped us

137
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,580
figure out how to go forward how to take

138
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:53,009
this idea and turn it into a reality

139
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:54,628
there were those<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who told</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us we</font>

140
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:57,270
were a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of idiots and then</font>

141
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:58,830
explained by we were idiots and told us

142
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">what we could do better that was really</font>

143
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,159
useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> constructive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advice and maybe we</font>

144
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,790
didn't enjoy listening to it at the time

145
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:08,170
but a developer's got where we are

146
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:10,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks to you guys thanks to the people</font>

150
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:30,549
somewhere to do everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

151
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,960
finished on the operations side we need

152
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,940
to smooth out a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rough</font>

153
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,870
edges I guess I hope you're not seeing

154
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,630
too many of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> from where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

155
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,500

156
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:42,090
first meeting your things you can

157
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously do better the next time and</font>

158
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,200
that's all part of increasing efficiency

159
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,030
that we can avoid little problems

160
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,700
everything went smoother cheaper faster

161
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:55,090
whatever but we really need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

162
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,380
is what we spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the time</font>

163
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:59,109
doing in our board retreat which is a

164
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,909
strategic vision we need to figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

165
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,410
not where we are today because we were

166
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,550
here already we've been doing a lot of

167
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:06,390
the same stuff for years and years and

168
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">years but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what do we want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be tomorrow</font>

169
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:10,570
there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of ideas over the</font>

170
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:11,890
years of what Nana I could do we're in a

171
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,450
position now where if you want to we can

172
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:19,120
make them happen we can collaborate to

173

educational opportunities that sort of

180
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:38,950
thing but we can't do a whole lot of

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,080
amendments in the original in the

original bylaws it was the board was

given the right to change the bylaws by

278
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,880
unanimous consent but those by tasha's

279

next election the board actually did

281
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,780
change the bylaws because the original

282
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,940
bylaws had a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> complicated structure</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the membership that was by the</font>

00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,540
that that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little silly so what we</font>

286
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:08,170
did is we simplify them greatly those

287
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:10,959
simplified membership requirements are

288
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:13,180
actually the way that we do membership

296
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,250
like a national election

297

millions of people and things like that

300
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:40,689
there are also four board members that

301
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:42,279
are up for election it turns out that we

302
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,980
only have four<font color="#E5E5E5"> people up for election</font>

303
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:46,510
for four empty seats so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

304
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably guess the results of that</font>

305
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,220
election however it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not as simple as</font>

306
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:53,440
that it turns out that we have three

307
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,750
board members that are up as normal it

308
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,910
turn their six not there are six

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:01,200
non-executive six elected board members

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:03,880
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> every year three are re-elected</font>

311
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
one of whom is termed out he cannot

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,660
stand for<font color="#CCCCCC"> re-election I would be our</font>

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,730
amazing<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chairman Steve Feldman who has</font>

00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually been in a ridiculous amount of</font>

help getting the new organization going

316
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:18,279
it turns out somebody else<font color="#E5E5E5"> also resigned</font>

317
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:20,050
in the middle of his term so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are we</font>

318
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:23,079
have appointed somebody Mike Smith Mike

319
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,209
raise your hand but because he was

320
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:27,189
appointed by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the board he</font>

321
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:30,790
needs to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> elected or somebody needs to</font>

322
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,620
be elected into that place because of

323
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way the elections work out because</font>

324
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,600
of where the resignation happened we

325
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:40,510
have three two year terms that are

326
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,579
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and one one-year term because</font>

329
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:48,130
his help but because of the when he

330
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,589
resigned he only gets one year left on

331
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:53,019
his term it this means that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

the person who gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fewest number of</font>

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,250
the other three will get it to your term

336
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,769
so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though it looks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like you have</font>

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:06,730
doesn't really matter it does actually

339
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:12,130
matter so please get on the web page and

please vote so membership starter

341

342
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:19,939
really matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can be you know on the</font>

343
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:21,500
South Pole ever attended and a dog

344

meeting never read the mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and</font>

346
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,600
generally means is we want a hundred

347
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">bucks so give us a hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bucks you can</font>

348
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,090
be a member we're happy to so there's

349
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:34,100
only one membership class the nice thing

350
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,230
about the membership class is that if

351
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,530
you actually join you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get twenty five</font>

352
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,450
dollars off your off your fees to come

353
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:42,860
to now to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 39 hours</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a year it</font>

354
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,980
means it literally cost you twenty-five

355
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,540
dollars to come to now per year in that

356
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,280
awesome but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys want to I mean</font>

357
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,480
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a member per year isn't that</font>

358
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,790
awesome you guys all want to be members

359
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">now anybody who is in this room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and not</font>

360
00:14:52,790 --> 00:15:03,349
a member raise your hand Jeff is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jeff is</font>

361
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:07,880
marvel guess he's getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hit after</font>

362
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:09,950
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I will find the two of them and</font>

363
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,650
beat them silly until they give me a

364
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,600
hundred dollars members kept the real

365
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,130
difference between people who can vote

366
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:18,020
sorry the real difference between a

367
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,970
member and non-member is that numbers

368
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,740
keep up so you can elect people like me

369
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,020
think I'm silly then you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

370
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,400
vote for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's kind of strange I'm</font>

371
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:28,460
standing up here given that statement

372
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:30,380
isn't it but if you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> member you can</font>

373
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:34,400
vote and that's what you should do

374
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,930
remember you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should vote so please vote</font>

375
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,390
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the membership class because if you</font>

376
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,910
do not it will revert to the old way

377
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:42,620
which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think was perfect it</font>

378
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,350
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad but I think the new way is</font>

379
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:50,670
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> Duane</font>

380
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:52,140
the other so Louie committee

381
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,510
simplification this is another thing

382
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we went through when we started we</font>

383
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:58,459
have some grandiose ideas and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

384
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:01,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually made sense at the time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

385
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:03,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> evolve we need to change</font>

386
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,600
slightly so one of the things we decided

387
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:08,130
to change for instance is we combined a

388
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,140
couple of the committee's the finance

389
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,720
and event committees are being combined

390
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,720
into a single committee this makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

391
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,690
given where we're going to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward so</font>

392
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,750
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> board is also allowed at its leisure</font>

393
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:23,970
to create ad hoc committees to ensure

394
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we're not just creating a million</font>

395
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,450
committees and for no apparent reason it

396
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:30,089
turns out that anybody who is a chairman

397
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:33,240
of any committee isn't non-voting but

398
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,950
still a member of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> board of nanog so</font>

399
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,779
we have some board members up here who

400
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,510
are not actually elected to the board

401
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:41,130
such as Dave and Masako they are the

402
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:42,330
chairman of individual committees and

403
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:44,370
they get to come to all the board

404
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:46,380
meetings they get to voice their

405
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:48,390
opinions they get to see all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mail</font>

406
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,700
that goes back and forth all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes</font>

407
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:53,699
that we produce and everything else that

408
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:55,200
happens and there are a few other

409
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,089
cleanups really minor you know

410
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,399
vocabulary stuff and language that

411
00:16:57,089 --> 00:17:01,380
needed to be changed slightly and we'd

412
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,790
appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> it you know the board clearly</font>

413
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,679
thinks that these are good ideas we put

414
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:06,000
it onto the ballot but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

415
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">board thinks it's a good idea doesn't</font>

416
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean it is the back stuff of all this</font>

417
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing that really matters is the</font>

418
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,880
community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're the community so</font>

419
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:18,359
you guys need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually read these</font>

420
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,670
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> see if they make sense and vote</font>

421
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,958
<font color="#CCCCCC">on them voting meeting the most</font>

422
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,400
important part so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to</font>

423
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,059
read<font color="#E5E5E5"> them come to me and i'll tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

424
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:28,439
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to vote how's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

425
00:17:26,059 --> 00:17:30,240
so the board candidates this is a really

426
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:32,549

votes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and therefore one more year to</font>

last two years I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> treasurer and you</font>

get to hear me talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about about that</font>

471
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:23,080
later otherwise I would just encourage

472
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:24,279
you to to vote I think some of the other

473
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,580
issues are a little bit more important

474
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:29,590
than the board candidate since we've got

475
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:33,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">44 44 so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of but</font>

476
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,178
otherwise please go out and vote thanks

communications committee chairperson I

480
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,360
really do think it's unfortunate<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

481
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,980
there only four of us because it does

482
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,168
kind of limit your options as to what

483
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can actually do in the democratic</font>

484
00:19:55,169 --> 00:19:58,679
process that Patrick was referring to so

485
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,900
that would definitely be one of my

486
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,789
target goals for either one or two years

487
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">is to make sure that there's a bigger</font>

slate of candidates the next time around

489
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,650
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> now that we're flush with cash</font>

490
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,510
which Dwayne will talk about using some

491
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that for community outreach to make</font>

492
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:16,020
sure that we have the next generation of

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that are a little less gray than</font>

actually prepared a statement sorry the

499
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,120
candidates were told they were going to

500

a good conference in and will continue

00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,370
I'm running unopposed I guess you'll be

571
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,860
electing me whether or not whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

572

want to or not but I'd appreciate<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

votes anyway again I'll be arriving

575
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:19,130
answer any questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> at that time just</font>

576
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:22,550
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> clear steve is unelected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

577
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:24,410
unpaid but he's put in a tremendous

578
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:26,510
amount of time and effort to the

579
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:29,090
organization he did right by laws he

580
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,500
came<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our retreat he's done a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

581
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">things for the organization with</font>

582
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,670
essentially no thanks so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

583
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,050
even though<font color="#E5E5E5"> he didn't put this in his</font>

584
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,750
personal statement and I probably

585
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:40,460
shouldn't buy us anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> towards him</font>

586
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,320
just want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know that he really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

587
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,980
done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and he is good for</font>

588
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,980
the organization

589
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:56,090
no we're gonna have to still be labelled

590
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:58,040
yet I so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to volunteer I I do</font>

591
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:01,370
believe that making the internet better

592
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:04,760
is a valuable cause and I do think it's

593
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:07,159
worthwhile that I devote time to it so I

594
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,200
have the time the energy and also the

595
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:12,970
desire to continue what was started here

596
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,750
at NOC so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm seeking a second mandate</font>

597
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:17,660
essentially to continue to

598
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:21,169
transformation and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I like to finish</font>

599
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:24,650
what I started I'd like also to explore

600
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:27,080
ways of doing other things with nana is

601
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,780
it education is it best operating

602
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,720
practices I want to listen to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you and</font>

603
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:34,970
implement what your desires are this

604
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,130
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ours and we need to</font>

605
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:42,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">shape it to what we believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is important</font>

606
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:45,320
so that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

607

609
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,660
alright so now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the QA which I'm</font>

610
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,180
hoping it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just I what</font>

611
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:00,400

621
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,840
this to actually happen and we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

622
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:27,820
some questions but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want this</font>

623
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,959
the last 10 hours so do<font color="#E5E5E5"> me a favor and</font>

624
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't repeat other people's questions</font>

625
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,940
unless there's an actual you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

626
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:37,320
important point behind it I have a

627
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">question for you first Todd who are you</font>

628
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,689
and you were tired I'm sorry Patrick<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

629
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:49,479
I got confused are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we supposed to vote</font>

630
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:54,520
or not I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciate if all of the</font>

631
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:56,260
members voted except Todd to the candy

632
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,270
that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing and it's for all</font>

633
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,129
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them going into that what I think is</font>

634
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:03,340
the most significant question which is

635
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:06,970
how much money should we say and what

636
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:14,770
should we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with that money get a</font>

637
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:18,970
microphone right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how much</font>

638
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:22,060
money should we save we talked about

639
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:23,470
this a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our retreat so you</font>

640
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:28,780
may get kind of the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer from</font>

641
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:31,000
everybody our goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the end of 2012</font>

642
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:38,889
was to have a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand cash and</font>

643
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:41,230
for 2013 250,000 buffer so that that's

644
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:43,690
our target and not and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

645
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:45,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that's realistic I think that's</font>

646
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,470
pretty good so I'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

647
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,330
later again but you know that money goes

648
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:50,650
to sort of cover our liabilities in the

649
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:55,030
case that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a meeting that totally</font>

650
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:56,620
falls apart and so on you know beyond

651
00:26:55,030 --> 00:27:02,160
those numbers i don't i don't think

652
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:02,159
nanog needs a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that</font>

653
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:06,800
so what Todd saying that nobody can hear

654
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,210
is what should we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the extra if</font>

655
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:17,600
there is extra money what should we do

656
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:19,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">with it I could use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a race well I think</font>

657
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think some of these ideas are going to</font>

658
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,710
come out later in the meeting I think if

659
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,970
we were in the situation where we sort

660
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,420
of did everything that we wanted to do

661
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:30,500
with our extra money I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

662
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,730
you know some of that money going back

663
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,850
to the sponsors and maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> lowering the</font>

664
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:37,010
sponsorship fees because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've</font>

665
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:39,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">been very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> generous to us I'd actually</font>

666
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:42,620
like the other candidates if they desire

667
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,970
to explain answer the last questions

668
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,050
what else what could we do with the

669
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:48,020
extra money because I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

670
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:49,490
just a treasure everything if you don't

671
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,840
want to answer that's fine too no it's

672
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:55,490
fun I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see more outreach</font>

673
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:58,310
towards not only more participation for

674
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:59,360
the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> but also again what I was</font>

675
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:01,220
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> before making sure that we</font>

676
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,969
continue this on beyond the present

677
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,710
group of people so I think using some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

678
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,240
that for community outreach and dare I

679
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:11,200
say it marketing which I know is a

680
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,070
verboten werden operations but still

681
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,720
spending some of that money to get the

682
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,300
nanog name out there in the community

683
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,000
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> continue to be important</font>

684
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:27,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think is a good way to spend extra</font>

685
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:30,020
dollars yes i would like to devote some

686
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:33,020
money to prepare to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next generation</font>

687
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that the appropriate level</font>

688
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:39,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">of knowledge and education is imparted</font>

689
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:42,260
onto them and making sure to that we

690
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:44,720
develop best practices and that we train

691
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,530
the next generation of network engineers

692
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,530
for our industry

693
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,490
as I've noticing my new gray hairs since

694
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Steven here not answering for him but I</font>

695
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,550
think he actually said some of that in a

696
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,960
statement so you should consider that

697
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:03,129
and I'd be happy to forward a statement

698
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,380
to anybody who's interested next all the

<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll let this I'll explain the</font>

00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:42,040
when we launched a transition we said

711
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:44,980
that we wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the same mission</font>

712
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,889
that we had and that we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expand</font>

713
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,230
it with education and we when we asked

714
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:52,450
ourselves why are we here it came clear

715
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,910
to us that we're here to<font color="#E5E5E5"> collaborate to</font>

716
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,370
make the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> better so maybe that's</font>

717
00:29:54,910 --> 00:30:00,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">that collaboration thing that's not part</font>

718
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:03,149
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDF where it is but we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want it</font>

719
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,580
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our</font>

doing you don't have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer i'm just</font>

721
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:12,100
giving you your time in<font color="#E5E5E5"> case you want it</font>

722
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:14,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly have no idea what Steve</font>

723
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:16,060
would say to that just because it sounds

724
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,450
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> board-level thing let's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just all</font>

725
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:21,399
be frank with each other there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

726
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,590
wrong with now and I et overlapping in

727
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:28,450
our goals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and let's be even more Frank</font>

728
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,669
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure the ietf succeeded so let's</font>

729
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:32,530
come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what let me</font>

730
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,790
address that what I can I'm not standing

731
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:37,210
for election I can just say whatever I

732
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:40,540
want now I don't see any conflict

733
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:43,630
honestly we came up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> our Y</font>

734
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,520
completely independently of theirs we

735
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:47,020
have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same mission perhaps to make</font>

736
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet better we go up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at it</font>

737
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:51,610
differently the ITF doesn't exist for

738
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same reason that nano does or they</font>

739
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,419
don't do the same things but if at the

740
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:59,170
end of the day the goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font>

741
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:01,120
today what's wrong with that and the ITF

742
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:03,010
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> nano deuce do actually do different</font>

743
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,500
things so there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong with</font>

744
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:08,200
both of them making the internet better

745
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,390
do we have any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other questions Patrick</font>

746
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,240
oh sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find somebody</font>

network

751
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,300
should we expand either geographically

752
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,730
or to other constituents because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

753
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:34,919
we primarily find people who are ISPs

754
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:38,280
are hosting providers candidates we have

755
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:41,070
discussed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one historically our name</font>

00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:51,720
Asia Europe Africa Latin America we're

759
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:54,450
not a closed member group all other

760
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,270
regions have also operator groups they

761
00:31:54,450 --> 00:32:00,270
already exist so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought that we</font>

762
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:03,060
should keep with our name unless the

763
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:07,080
members see it that the we should change

764
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:13,590
so then that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like a good ballot</font>

765
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:20,399
for next year any other candidates plus

813
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,149
collecting donations I want to correct

814
00:34:18,049 --> 00:34:22,699

815
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:24,440
was collecting donations long<font color="#CCCCCC"> before we</font>

816
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:27,408
started we had a membership structure

817
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,540
and those early donations were not

818
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:33,169
memberships in that sense because we

819
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:34,369
didn't have members of structure so some

820
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:36,319
of them were converted to membership

821
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:39,669
upon request of the people who donated

822
00:34:36,319 --> 00:34:42,109
right so anybody who has ever paid for

823
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:45,138
membership not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a flat-out donation</font>

00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,079
don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the cutoff was but</font>

827
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,419
it was relatively recent it was it was

852
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:59,900
Chris has done for us over the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font>

853
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:01,490
couple of years he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in at the</font>

854
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning of what was then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> called the</font>

855
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:06,919
marketing working group which is when we

856
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,660
started going out to the various vendors

857
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,450
and saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> do and give us some money in</font>

858
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:13,879
exchange for showing<font color="#CCCCCC"> your stuff with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

859
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,919

860
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:17,660
handle<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of that but under the</font>

861
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,880
marketing working group and we slander

862
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:22,399
the development committee that's become

863
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,890
a lot more formalized and a lot bigger

864
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:27,350
than it was and I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's an</font>

865
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:28,910
exaggeration to say that without the

866
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:31,460
efforts that Chris put into the

867
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:33,440
committee we wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here we</font>

868
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:36,650
wouldn't had the money to put this on so

869
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,740
if you see Chris please thank him please

870
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,900

917
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,770
about as far as financials<font color="#CCCCCC"> Duane will go</font>

918
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">over a lot more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the details but I</font>

919
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:26,500
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus just basically on the</font>

920
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:28,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">development committee committee and the</font>

921
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,420
numbers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have been coming in and</font>

922
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:33,610
this is just pure sponsorship

923
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:38,230
contributions so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nana on 52 we've</font>

924
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:40,690
had 200 220 7333 dollars come in for

925
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,890
that meeting so this was dumper and then

926
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:47,210
for this meeting for<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 53 we've had</font>

927
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:50,020
260 $1,500 come in

928
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:53,839
this is pretty much fifteen percent

929
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:56,359
meeting over<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting increase and I'm</font>

930
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,060
hoping to continue to refine some of our

931
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:02,150
programs<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that we can continue to</font>

932
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,940
increase that fifteen percent possibly

933
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:07,460
up to fifty percent sixty percent reason

934
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:11,210
for that is because we need this for the

935
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:13,369
continuity of nanog and as every few of

936
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,130
the board members<font color="#CCCCCC"> have mentioned we</font>

937
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,570
really do want to see these meetings

938
00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:19,760
continue and be comfortable and have

939
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:21,560
that reserve so that if anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

940
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,810
happen that we are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sustain</font>

941
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,500
ourselves and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's very very</font>

942
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:29,210
important and as we incrementally

943
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:32,900
increase the revenue the sponsorship

944
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:36,050
revenue I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work with our</font>

945
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">committees and see how we can pay off</font>

946
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:42,109
these loans<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey and then of course</font>

947
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:45,349
future fund future<font color="#CCCCCC"> Na Nog meetings and</font>

948
00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:48,470
then another portion of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> revenues</font>

949
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:50,810
or the contributions should go toward

950
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:53,060
nanog programs again as mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

951
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:56,060
educational programs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make</font>

952
00:40:53,060 --> 00:41:00,170
this organization what it is and then

953
00:40:56,060 --> 00:41:01,890
allow other new members and new

954
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,910
attendees

955
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:08,670

sponsorship in other words is this

958
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:17,729
donation somebody just gave us is it

959
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:21,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">period</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is it lunch instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of just</font>

960
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:24,710
trying to understand since I sure so

961
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:27,660
sponsorship these dollars are actually

962
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:30,330
attached to a program and these are

963
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:33,930
programs you can see are articulated on

964
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:36,240
the website so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you go to the link you</font>

965
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:38,730
will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kinds of programs bien gear</font>

966
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">once being one of our most popular we</font>

967
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:44,160
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> have not lab we also have of course</font>

968
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:46,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">the overall sponsorships for hosting</font>

969
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,839
meetings and then on the individual

970
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:50,640
items that go along with that which

971
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">would be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lanyards we make in the</font>

972
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,910
batch or the agenda sponsorships so

973
00:41:53,670 --> 00:42:00,450
there are little price points or

974
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:03,600
sponsorship revenue price points that we

975
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:06,810
put to these programs and they all add

976
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,450
up to these numbers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> sakai might be</font>

977
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:11,580
clarify one thing that we also certainly

978
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:13,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">would not turn down do not turn down</font>

979
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:17,100
donations if a company wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

980
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,470
cash or services or whatever not as part

981
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,640
of a program we happily accept it the

982
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,230
program is a little bit different we

983
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,660
call them in donations not sponsorships

984
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:30,150
but we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to take it yeah right</font>

985
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:32,009
and it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just really sponsorship</font>

986
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,560
dollars it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> include the</font>

987
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:42,690
contributions<font color="#CCCCCC"> and/or the membership fee</font>

988
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:45,759
different revenue line one question

989
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:47,800
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sponsorship so I have you were</font>

990
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,390
in the older days in different housing

991
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,130
sponsorship programs which may be why i

992
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:55,000
remember members organized questions

993
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:56,920
about what exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the program so one</font>

994
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,020
of the question is how satisfied are you

995
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,790
and how satisfied are the people who are

996
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:02,950
buying sponsorships that we've done this

997
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:06,490
right like are we going to we've got

999
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,569

1000
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,220
keeping to those work to those work for

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:23,140
money well of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more to</font>

1005
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,330
answer the first part of your question

1006
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:27,400
these programs definitely have worked

1007
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:30,610
they have worked because they have been

1008
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">set up and created specifically so that</font>

1009
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:35,560
we can run<font color="#E5E5E5"> these now knock meetings and</font>

1010
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:38,260
it is aligned with not only<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

1011
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:40,840
sponsors are looking for but what we as

1012
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:42,670
attendees wand and we got a lot of this

1013
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:45,100
feedback from the surveys that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sent</font>

1014
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:47,620
out throughout all of our meetings and

1015
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:51,220
so they have been appropriately set up

1016
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,150
as far as sponsor feedback they are very

1017
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,669
happy

1018
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:59,349
of course they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to more get more to</font>

1019
00:43:54,670 --> 00:44:01,569
our group in our community what the

1020
00:43:59,349 --> 00:44:05,010
board has done and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Development Committee</font>

1021
00:44:01,569 --> 00:44:07,869
has done however is we are kind of

1022
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:11,440
squashing the idea that we're marketing

1023
00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:13,180
as if we were attending a trade show so

1024
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,510
that is one thing that we've kind of

1025
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:20,169
stayed away from and as as many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1026
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:22,779
have said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want those</font>

1027
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:25,170
sales people all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> you and we have</font>

1028
00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:27,400
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respect your space and your</font>

1029
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy here when you're attending the</font>

1030
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:32,109
meeting so I think the programs are

1031
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,868
designed definitely to allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1032
00:44:32,109 --> 00:44:40,960
and then also at the same time have that

1033
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:43,150
revenue stream coming in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Boston with</font>

1034
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:46,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">water stone communications I was</font>

1035
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:49,960
wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if these are purely cash</font>

1036
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:53,500
sponsorships or in-kind as well it is

1037
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">purely cash as I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said we do happily</font>

1038
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:58,960
accept in-kind donations but those are a

1039
00:44:55,329 --> 00:45:00,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">different program and I think it's</font>

1040
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,859
important just because you asked the

1041
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,839
question we do have a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks</font>

1042
00:45:02,859 --> 00:45:07,619
who are recognized on our website as

1043
00:45:04,839 --> 00:45:10,089
contributors so those in the

1044
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:13,140
contributors are really the in-kind set

1045
00:45:10,089 --> 00:45:15,490
of services that are offered to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana I</font>

1046
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,230
think it's important to mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1047
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:19,899
what the program<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development</font>

1048
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:22,660
committee what the development committee

1049
00:45:19,900 --> 00:45:26,349
has done and achieved this year is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1050
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:30,359
decouple the sponsorship money from a

1051
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:34,839
meeting to meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked so we have</font>

1052
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:37,839
yearly sponsorships so a sponsor can buy

1053
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:39,970
a full year so sponsorship over three

1054
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:43,328
meetings and they can also buy

1055
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:45,368
activities on a permitting basis so what

1056
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:47,859
the development committee has done is to

1057
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:49,660
listen to our sponsors that said I

1058
00:45:47,859 --> 00:45:51,788
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you money but you're</font>

1059
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:55,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming to me at the wrong time in the</font>

1060
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:59,380
year so they've answer that

1061
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:01,270
any other questions all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna</font>

1062
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:06,420

1064
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:17,400
so I again for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those of you that are on</font>

1065

the slide shows the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state of our</font>

1089
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:46,630
because we plan on using sort of this

1090
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,759
the same set of categories for all the

1091
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:52,760

August here versus meeting vs right now

1100
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,000
my sponsor<font color="#E5E5E5"> here dear i'm on buying years</font>

1101
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:31,580
worth of here so a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1102
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:34,910
see I'm coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of waking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up from Rip</font>

1103
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:39,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">Van Winkle state you know where things</font>

1104
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:44,020
were a little different right right so a

1105
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:49,430
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things the the spring meeting of</font>

1106
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:51,380
2011 does not go does not accumulate in

1107
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:55,899
in these in these revenues because we

1108
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:59,380
did run that meeting so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1109
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:03,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">or meet you mean Wyoming yeah yeah yeah</font>

1110
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:06,430
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is two they know August so this</font>

1111
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:09,520
this sponsorship amount here mostly

1112
00:49:06,430 --> 00:49:12,970
represents the previous meeting nanog 52

1113
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:19,509
a lot of the sponsors hadn't paid for

1114
00:49:12,970 --> 00:49:22,359
down at 53 at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> August ok so in</font>

1115
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:23,829
fact if if we had a more current

1116
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,119
financial report that that number would

1117
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:27,309
be a lot higher because we have gotten a

1118
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,559
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money in through September and</font>

1119
00:49:27,309 --> 00:49:32,260
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this month so are our</font>

1120
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:35,430
income revenue for sponsorships is a lot

1121
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,430
higher at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

1122
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,800
here

1123
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:47,750
right so Randy's point is that a

1124
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,250
sponsorship is sold sort of on a yearly

1125
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,080
basis you sign up to be a sponsor for a

1126
00:49:49,250 --> 00:49:53,810
year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then why are we sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of talking</font>

1127
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:59,779
about per meeting sponsorships is it is

1128
00:49:53,810 --> 00:50:01,250
that like yeah this is just by cash

1129
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,660
versus accrual<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody gives</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a</font>

1130
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:04,640
hundred thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's for</font>

1131
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:06,710
three meetings<font color="#CCCCCC"> randy wants</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know how</font>

1132
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:09,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows up do you recognize that in</font>

1133
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:12,110
the reports at 33 3333 across the three

1134
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,090
meetings do you set something Assad like

1135
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:16,100
just what are we supposed to see what

1136
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:17,510
are you doing cash basis accounting your

1137
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,069
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> its architects accrual basis</font>

1138
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:21,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">accounting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's accrual basis</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah</font>

1139
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:27,410
so we're not recognizing the full cash

1140
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:28,549
contribution at the time Randy can you

1141
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,859
go to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> microphone if you keep talking</font>

1142
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:34,540
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> send people there are people on</font>

1143
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:34,540

1144
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:47,480
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> we took in significantly more</font>

1145
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:50,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">than 270 cash up till the end of august</font>

1146
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:52,880
and you haven't realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because a</font>

1147
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,500
significant amount of it was due for

1148
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,840
future meetings because they brought in

1149
00:50:54,500 --> 00:51:01,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> woman and you're on accrual basis</font>

1150
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:01,660
question I voice is yes

1151
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:10,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you other thing to note here on</font>

1152
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:17,120
this slide is the loan from Aaron sixty

1153
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:19,370
thousand dollars total this slide

1154
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:22,460
represents actual budget numbers or

1155
00:51:19,370 --> 00:51:24,319
actual numbers from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first two</font>

1156
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:29,330
meetings of this year I don't I guess it

1157
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:31,520
is cut off there a little bit but as you

1158
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,170
can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> on both of those meetings you</font>

1159
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,670
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're still coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out ahead the</font>

1160
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:40,010
second one we came out quite a bit ahead

1161
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:41,300
and if I may since this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault on</font>

1162
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:44,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the slide that's on the screen right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,310
for the Miami meeting the three hundred

1164
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:48,259
seventy thousand dollar number is

1165
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:51,350
combined registrations plus sponsorships

1166
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:53,720
since we didn't have access to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> book</font>

work cadet numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Dwayne's version</font>

1170
00:51:56,120 --> 00:52:03,140
wrong so by me yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's right so</font>

1171
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:05,090
they forgot<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the that</font>

1172
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,950

1173
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:09,520

00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:09,520
sponsorship

1175
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:19,830
this slide shows<font color="#E5E5E5"> the account balances as</font>

1177
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:21,960
operating account again is a lot higher

1178
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:23,130
now because we've had a lot of

1179
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,420
sponsorship money come in<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this</font>

1181
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:31,170
opportunity to note that on the mailing

1182
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,990
list we've talked about posting you know

1183
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:37,890
more standardized reports and we're

1184
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:39,600
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you if you log into</font>

1188
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:53,970
and when we get the accounts reconciled

1189
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:55,259
for the end of September then we'll post

1190
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well and send out some some</font>

1191
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:03,600
notices that probably won't happen until

1192
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:04,950
a couple of weeks from<font color="#E5E5E5"> now here are the</font>

1193
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:10,350
estimates<font color="#E5E5E5"> two for the end of the year</font>

1194
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:12,450
finances for this meeting for Nanak 53

1195
00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:15,270
if we budgeted in our budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1196
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:18,330
predicted about 500 attendees and I know

1197
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:21,270
that we're at about 560 already so we're

1198
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:24,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing very well there should should be a</font>

1199
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:24,290
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> higher on registrations</font>

1200
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:34,810
the slide shows our budget for tails

1201
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:37,030
2012 and here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that on the on</font>

1202
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:40,779
the expense side the reserve and the

1203
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:42,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">loan repayments are no longer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> zero so by</font>

1204
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,380
the end of 2012 we plan on having one

1205
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,319
hundred twenty thousand dollars in

1206
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:49,500
reserve to pay for to cover liabilities

1207
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,210
for loan contracts and whatnot for

1208
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:55,590
future meetings and we plan on paying

1209
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:55,590
back to loan that we have from Erin in

1210
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:04,660
question yes 60,000 95,000 interest rate

1211
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:11,350
or what we received<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30 thousand in 2011</font>

1212
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:14,710
from Erin<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you yeah tied on</font>

1213
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:16,509
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> road again so just a gross order of</font>

1214
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:19,810
not like picking<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the details but it</font>

1215
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:22,120
looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we grossed 120,000 in the</font>

1216
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:25,600
Denver Heating and then we're planning

1217
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:31,180
on grossing for if you go back to 2011

1218
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:34,630
for all of 2011 we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping to end up</font>

1219
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:36,100
with 25k so that means so what that

1220
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:38,050
tells me is that you guys are expecting

1221
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,630
to lose a moderate amount of money on

1222
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:44,400
this meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ground no I think it's</font>

1223
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:44,400
a combination of being conservative and

1224
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:54,340
operations yeah 2001<font color="#CCCCCC"> todd is only two</font>

1225
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:59,140
meetings right 2011 is only two meetings

1226
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:02,470
that are new nog it's 52 and 53<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1227
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:06,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">plus we so what's interesting is the</font>

1228
00:55:02,470 --> 00:55:08,319
next year 2012 but but all I'm saying is

1229
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:10,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it looks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like in 52 we had a gross</font>

1230
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,520
margin of 120,000 and it looks like

1231
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:14,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're projecting a gross margin for the</font>

1232
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire year including one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1233
00:55:14,109 --> 00:55:17,769
meaning of 25,000 that's all the

1234
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:20,049
inspector<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose a hundred thousand on</font>

1235
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:22,118
this team no it's at a meeting

1236
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:27,309
accounting and it doesn't account for

1237
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:31,509
the regular operations like a ms Marilyn

1238
00:55:27,309 --> 00:55:32,769
I see you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so either we as the</font>

1239
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:34,900
membership we're going to have to get

1240
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:36,729
used to that or you guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1241
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,440
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allocate operating expense per</font>

1242
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:39,940
meeting because I'm still used to you

1243
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,799
can see why I end up at this position it

1244
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,359
looks like if there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a 120,000 for</font>

1245
00:55:41,799 --> 00:55:47,200
meeting but at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end of the year we've</font>

1246
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:49,538
got 25,000 to show for it and that's in

1247
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:53,200
into anal talk to about how we're going

1248
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:54,940
to share the quarterly financials with

1249
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,029
all of you but the important thing I

1250
00:55:54,940 --> 00:56:02,559
think correct me if I'm wrong doing but

1251
00:55:58,029 --> 00:56:05,259
in the number that you see for 2012 one

1252
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,150
of the buckets is there is it already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1253
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:10,180
there it's not on the line but there is

1254
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:12,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">a set aside 120 thousand dollar reserve</font>

1255
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:15,160
that's already taken<font color="#E5E5E5"> out for liability</font>

1256
00:56:12,579 --> 00:56:18,099
so I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you add it up it's</font>

1257
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:20,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">really 121 that's really net available</font>

1258
00:56:18,099 --> 00:56:22,599
to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok and this other way this is</font>

1259
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:26,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">fantastic news</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all of us thought</font>

1260
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:28,239
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> self-sustaining could do even</font>

1261
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:29,920
better and<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do more so I'm not</font>

1262
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:31,210
criticizing it all this is wonderful and

1263
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,019
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to understand so</font>

1264
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:37,660
thank you for reading<font color="#CCCCCC"> Moshe I take are</font>

1265
00:56:35,019 --> 00:56:45,328
fairly under swelling just stood

1266
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:48,879
standard ways of doing this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and accruing</font>

1267
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:52,390
expenses accruing income properly

1268
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:55,720
reported in<font color="#E5E5E5"> recently and I'm sure you'll</font>

1269
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:58,049
find them to them and quarterly<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1270
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:01,480
meeting I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't care what the particular</font>

1271
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:03,369
reporting frequency is I think a third

1272
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:06,039
or a quarter<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the years really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nice</font>

1273
00:57:03,369 --> 00:57:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the third may be easier for you</font>

1274
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:12,069

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and forth</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a very respectful what</font>

1381
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,760
I was curious about was what the board's

1382
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:27,070
take on that was at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point now that</font>

1383
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:29,380
the finances have been looked at you

1384
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:32,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">know we all saw the model that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Duane put</font>

1385
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:34,810
together as far as what the finances

1386
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:36,849
were for the last few meetings we saw

1387
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:41,080
what the surplus was think we understood

1388
01:03:36,849 --> 01:03:43,540
it to be you know less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than something</font>

1389
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:46,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">like twenty two thousand dollars total</font>

1390
01:03:43,540 --> 01:03:49,630
in less revenue over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the course of a</font>

1391
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:51,160
three meeting year to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and so</font>

1392
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:52,450
suddenly like to hear the<font color="#CCCCCC"> board's</font>

1393
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,410
feedback from that

1394
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:56,750
obviously I know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people</font>

1395
01:03:54,410 --> 01:04:00,348
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> opposite side i'm not going to</font>

1396
01:03:56,750 --> 01:04:02,660
provide commentary on that yet until you

1397
01:04:00,349 --> 01:04:05,750
know kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a response</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we</font>

1398
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:08,808
looked at that and did your question can

1399
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:11,930
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford it the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer is yes it's</font>

1400
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:17,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">estimated to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 to 20 thousand</font>

1401
01:04:11,930 --> 01:04:19,490
dollars permitting permitting so under

1402
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:22,670
our current model yes we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> afford</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1403
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:25,308
but what we discussed is is that

1404
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you guys want is that</font>

1405
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:29,869
something desirable and that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

1406
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to hear what you think about</font>

1407
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:35,480
this so as a board where we can tell you

1408
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:39,710
that yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can afford it but we haven't</font>

1409
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:42,049
decided if we if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were for it or</font>

1410
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,819
against it Dave can you give a quick

1411
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:45,470
description exactly what you're

1412
01:04:43,819 --> 01:04:46,880
referring to<font color="#E5E5E5"> because not necessarily</font>

1413
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:49,700
everybody with yeah that's right that's

1414
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,440
her so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that technically</font>

1415
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:53,598
that email only goes out at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point I</font>

1416
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">think only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> members are subscribed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1417
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:59,059
futures correct no no future is correct

1418
01:04:56,119 --> 01:05:01,010
future development as a member at but it

1419
01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:02,270
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> has like 400 is closed obviously</font>

1420
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:03,710
for some reason I thought futures at

1421
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:07,579
some point had also been linked to

1422
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:11,270
members in some way so<font color="#CCCCCC"> as I alluded to</font>

1423
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:13,099
earlier my proposal was that for program

1424
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,509
committee members or potentially you

1425
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:18,410
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can also talk about any of the</font>

1426
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:20,089
committee's who attend a minimum<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount</font>

1427
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:22,520
of those committee meetings between

1428
01:05:20,089 --> 01:05:24,710
meetings as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned you know if you</font>

1429
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:29,000
calculate it out it's usually about 60

1430
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:31,220
hours a year of time you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

1431
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:33,200
is generally during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work day so it's</font>

1432
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:36,709
our employers who are graciously giving

1433
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:39,078
us this time to use to give back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:41,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">nana community in exchange for that</font>

1435
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:43,579
allowing the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have contributed</font>

01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:46,309
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time in this effort to these</font>

1437
01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:49,880
meetings to attend these meetings for

1438
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:51,230
free you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know everyone so certainly</font>

1439
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,180
would have the option to pay if they

1440
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:55,339
felt like they it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was their obligation</font>

1441
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,598
to pay but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1442
01:05:55,339 --> 01:05:59,119
think that if we're going to select

1443
01:05:56,599 --> 01:06:01,220
someone for these committees that they

1444
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:02,810
could be trusted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose whether or</font>

1445
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:08,299
not it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was appropriate for them to pay</font>

1446
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:10,340
pay given their means of pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether</font>

1447
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,500
that be their employer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or out of their</font>

1448
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:14,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">own pocket obviously there needs to be</font>

1449
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:17,090
some sort of guideline like you attend X

1450
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:20,750
number of meetings you give X number of

1451
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:21,980
hours whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may be you know that</font>

1452
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:23,570
can be able to the committee chairs that

1453
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:28,250
can be codified in some way whatever

1454
01:06:23,570 --> 01:06:29,540
that is so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to speaking</font>

1455
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,700
slightly for the board here I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just want</font>

1456
01:06:29,540 --> 01:06:33,050
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that when the so when this</font>

1457
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:35,450
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> first came up the board took</font>

1458
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:37,340
officially no position on it at the time

1459
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:39,350
we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the financials back yet</font>

1460
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:40,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">so just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that everybody knows one of</font>

1461
01:06:39,350 --> 01:06:41,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the reasons that we decided to do this</font>

1462
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,040
because we honestly did not know and

1463
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:44,450
this was mentioned at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

1464
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:46,279
did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not know what the financial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact</font>

1465
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:47,480
would be now<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've seen the</font>

1466
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,740
financials and we understand it as

1467
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:50,000
Sylvia said it's clear that we can

1468
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:53,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">afford this because we have somewhat of</font>

1469
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:56,000
a surplus on the meetings just<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

1470
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:57,230
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys do understand we make a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1471
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">money for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the meeting but as you saw on</font>

1472
01:06:57,230 --> 01:06:59,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Duane slide that doesn't mean we make a</font>

1473
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:02,960
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the year because we</font>

1474
01:06:59,870 --> 01:07:04,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't put all of the non meeting</font>

1475
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,440
expenses into that number that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you saw</font>

1476
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,450
which was reasonably large for each

1477
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,520
meeting that we make some money on so

1478
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:11,930
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we're going to end the</font>

1479
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:13,040
me every year with<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know half a</font>

1480
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:14,690
million dollars or something like that

1481
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:17,150
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not the case as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you saw</font>

1482
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:20,750
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of 2011 we're $25,000 ahead</font>

1483
01:07:17,150 --> 01:07:22,160
and if every committee member on every

1484
01:07:20,750 --> 01:07:23,630
single committee does not pay a

1485
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,100
registration fee in comes to nanog

1486
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:28,370
that's the loss of<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty thousand</font>

1487
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,930
dollars per meeting not per year so<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1488
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:31,910
clear on this we think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford it</font>

1489
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:35,060
but it's not a slam dunk and it's

1490
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a non-trivial expense in</font>

1491
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:38,360
loss of revenue Patrick can I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just ask</font>

1492
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:39,709
how when we get to that

1493
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:42,830
twenty-thousand-dollar<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting number</font>

1494
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:47,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on 17pc members this is</font>

1495
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:49,340
an 517 I'll see members<font color="#E5E5E5"> six development</font>

1496
01:07:47,210 --> 01:07:51,830
members three committee 3 communications

1497
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:53,720
community members<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 board members times</font>

1498
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:54,860
four hundred fifty dollars each its

1499
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:56,689
twenty thousand two hundred and thirty

1500
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,740
dollars two hundred and twenty thousand

1501
01:07:56,690 --> 01:07:59,720
two hundred fifty dollars I did the

1502
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,339
calculation myself we also by the way

1503
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,470
added in it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little more than that</font>

1504
01:08:01,340 --> 01:08:04,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I ended up adding some members</font>

1505
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:06,470
because if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bylaws it</font>

1506
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:07,970
says things like the communication

1507
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:10,730
committee must have at least three

1508
01:08:07,970 --> 01:08:14,259
members right so we added in some extra

1509
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:16,370
committee because right before Mike was

1510
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,930
selected to replace RS on the

1511
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:19,790
word the communication committee had

1512
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:22,460
four members right so there are extra

1513
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:24,170
people involved so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> we took a little</font>

1514
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:26,810
extra and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we figured out what it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was and</font>

1515
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,310
we were conservative about this right as

1516
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:30,440
in for a penny in for a pound we didn't

1517
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:32,000
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up like saying oh well we</font>

1518
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:35,029
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can make it if it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only the pc</font>

1519
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,830
or something like that anyway end of day

1520
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:39,529
just want to let everybody know we think

1521
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:40,819
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can afford it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something to</font>

1522
01:08:39,529 --> 01:08:42,349
discuss and we'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to hear what the</font>

1523
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:43,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">community has to say about it we've</font>

1524
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:46,850
heard some stuff on the mailing list I'm

1525
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:48,020
positive somebody I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who is</font>

1526
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:50,210
going to reiterate what they said on the

1527
01:08:48,020 --> 01:08:53,150
mailing list but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like to also</font>

1529
01:08:53,149 --> 01:08:56,029
all trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell randy to sit down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

1530
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,110
should say what he has to say but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1531
01:08:56,029 --> 01:09:01,219
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like also other people who haven't</font>

1532
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:03,710
participated in the mailing list<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

1533
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,630
ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and step up one last comment just</font>

1534

so that everybody knows nanog<font color="#E5E5E5"> futures</font>

01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:12,950
is open<font color="#CCCCCC"> to everybody and believe it or</font>

1537
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:15,830
not everybody who<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a member is not</font>

1538

subscribed and our futures don't ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1539
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:20,200
why it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just happens to be the case so</font>

1540
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:25,569
now I'm features is orthogonal to

01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:36,230
of course important but I don't think

<font color="#CCCCCC">around this at least two maybe three</font>

1547
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:48,050
issues

1548
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:50,420
one was whether there should be I don't

1549
01:09:48,050 --> 01:09:53,300
know exalted members or fellows or

1550
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:56,060
something like that etc each time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1551
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:59,720
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're pushing something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's way</font>

1552
01:09:56,060 --> 01:10:08,470
at the bottom is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as operators were</font>

1553
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:08,470
peers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this creates unevenness</font>

1554
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:15,190
but

1555
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe there was universal support</font>

1556
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:21,919
for you know folk who can't afford it

1557
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:25,010
should be supported somehow that that

1558
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:27,140
wasn't that wasn't the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

1559
01:10:25,010 --> 01:10:30,710
wasn't the real issue though of course

1560
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:37,210
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> checked had been built but it</font>

1561
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:37,210
was classes this is a one glass of water

1562
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:46,530
Todd yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefly so PC members I'm</font>

1563
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:48,330
much more experienced with PC members

1564
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:50,909
having served on the pc in the past for

1565
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:53,040
a long time PC members are required to

1566
01:10:50,909 --> 01:10:55,530
attend two out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> three nano a year and</font>

1567
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:57,630
I think that's makes good sense because

1568
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:59,009
people shouldn't be programming the

1569
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:01,260
content of a conference they don't

1570
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:03,929
attend it doesn't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sense so</font>

1571
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,030
that's great but by virtue of being

1572
01:11:03,929 --> 01:11:10,800
requiring PC members to attend those

1573
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:12,929
conferences we may tend to move the pc

1574
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,580
towards a class of wealthy individuals

1575
01:11:12,929 --> 01:11:17,610
or individuals employed by large

1576
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:20,969
corporations because self-employed

1577
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:23,519
individuals on a margin you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be</font>

1578
01:11:20,969 --> 01:11:25,739
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for other opportunities to spend</font>

1579
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:27,449
that money now there are PC members in

1580
01:11:25,739 --> 01:11:28,888
the past who have griped about this some

1581
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:31,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">of them may be sitting on the far right</font>

1582
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:34,260
of the stage and one of the good aspects

1583
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:36,360
of this has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's produced more</font>

1584
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:38,670
content right because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> give speakers</font>

1585
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,839
free attendance so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're</font>

1586
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:42,300
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this we need to look at</font>

1587
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">two things one is I agree with Randy</font>

1588
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:47,190
there should be a separate class of

1589
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,780
people but I do think that pc members in

1590
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:51,360
particular because of the requirement to

1591
01:11:48,780 --> 01:11:53,009
attend should have the option to have

1592
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:54,630
their attendance waived if they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1593
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:56,550
their company can't afford it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or if they</font>

1594
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:58,080
can't afford<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but I also do you think</font>

1595
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:00,420
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at free attendance for</font>

1596
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,980
speakers as well and see is that like

1597
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:04,619
that's actually the bigger subsidy that

1598
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:06,000
we have it's a good tool towards getting

1599
01:12:04,619 --> 01:12:08,070
a certain amount of content and maybe

1600
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,050
maybe we just leave that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there maybe we</font>

1601
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:11,400
just say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know committee members who</font>

1602
01:12:10,050 --> 01:12:13,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to get in for free should produce</font>

1603
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,929
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> freakin content for the conference</font>

1604
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,190
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> worked for professor converging on</font>

1605
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:20,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">the corner there so maybe it'll more</font>

1606
01:12:17,190 --> 01:12:22,619
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's just I I think we</font>

1607
01:12:20,429 --> 01:12:24,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consider the way it shifts who</font>

1608
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:27,269
gets to attend and what the incentives

1609
01:12:24,510 --> 01:12:30,239
are so just just so that I'm clear Todd

1610
01:12:27,270 --> 01:12:33,900
what you're saying is you've volunteered

1611
01:12:30,239 --> 01:12:36,360
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dave said 60 hours towards nanog</font>

1612
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:38,369
and we're requiring you to attend the

1613
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:41,130
conference and if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get this</font>

1614
01:12:38,369 --> 01:12:42,540
four hundred and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty dollar 425</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is cat</font>

1615
01:12:41,130 --> 01:12:44,400
rightfully points out because you must

1616
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:45,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a member already so we're crying you</font>

1617
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,519
to be a member we're requiring you to

1618
01:12:45,599 --> 01:12:48,860
donate<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 hours</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of your time we're</font>

1619
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:52,010
requiring you to attend the meeting

1620
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:54,139
and we're requiring you to pay that $425

1621
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:57,140
and if you want that $425 waived please

1622
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:58,790
go and do some more<font color="#CCCCCC"> work that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right ok</font>

1623
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:01,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">just this so that I'm clear yeah that's</font>

1624
01:12:58,790 --> 01:13:03,980
right that's actually a fair way of

1625
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:06,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying that doesn't all add up to and</font>

1626
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:07,610
that's wrong right I didn't say did I

1627
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,930
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be clear on what you're</font>

1628
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:10,759
saying exactly the current state<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1629
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:13,070
affairs and so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current state</font>

1630
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:14,960
or that are those the incentives we want

1631
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:18,410
and are those the costs we want that's

1632
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:20,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">right yeah that's right Chris I'll yield</font>

1633
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:23,330
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> joke for a second no no go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ahead</font>

1634
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:24,590
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right good job so your farmer</font>

1635
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:29,360
I was cooking on this issue than<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1636
01:13:24,590 --> 01:13:35,320
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> go I'm not outspoken back in</font>

1637
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:38,179
reality land Joe provo nanog member<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1638
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:41,420
realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had something see what I did</font>

1639
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:43,790
there I realized they had something just

1640
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:47,600
in a draft folder that I shot a shot off

1641
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:49,580
this so this afternoon on this topic and

1642
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's dead hey I don't think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we should be</font>

1643
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:52,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down the road of codifying</font>

1644
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,750
anything because that gets in the

1645
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:55,370
micromanagement that we've been

1646
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:56,660
attempting to avoid in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in the</font>

1647
01:13:55,370 --> 01:14:00,680
structure of any of the bylaws and

leeway that was during during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> merit</font>

1650
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:10,750
days for the then SC chair to waive a

1651
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:14,320
few hardship cases we should if

1652
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:19,660
codifying anything recognize the

1653
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:23,290
hardship and just go ahead and tack on a

1654
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:28,610
while I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with both Randy and Todd's</font>

1655
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:30,590
points go ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say and if</font>

1656
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:32,269
somebody's been doing exemplary work we

1657
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:34,400
certainly expected the chair of the

1658
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:38,330
board for instance to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say</font>

1659
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:39,980
yeah you're good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> patricks point yes</font>

1660
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:42,769
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked them to do some more work but</font>

1661
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:44,740
all the requirements for being on the pc

1662
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:46,240
they know before they signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up if</font>

1663
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:52,719
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that they shouldn't be</font>

1664
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:58,179
running that's it Chris lighter now I

1665
01:14:52,720 --> 01:15:00,940
remember let me say to start out with I

1666
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:03,730
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that waving membership</font>

1667
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:05,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">fees is a creating of a two class system</font>

1668
01:15:03,730 --> 01:15:06,700
because for most of those committees

1669
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:08,019
you're going to turn out anyway and

1670
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:10,570
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be returned to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plebe</font>

1671
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:14,140
class so i'm not i'm not sure that that

1672
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:15,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">I agree with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily</font>

1673
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:18,520
have a problem with waving registration

1674
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:21,760
fees for committee members it's probably

1675
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:24,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">an intriguing way to get more people to</font>

1676
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,320
actually want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to volunteer to run for</font>

1677
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:28,210
office or to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> appointed to the</font>

1678
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,889
committee's but I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say that</font>

1679
01:15:28,210 --> 01:15:31,930
when we're talking about the hardship

1680
01:15:29,890 --> 01:15:34,810
aspect of things if we're really serious

1681
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:36,880
about you know the hardship issue I

1682
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:40,780
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should probably be more focused</font>

1683
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:43,600
on putting more into our scholarship

1684
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:46,389
fund and sponsoring people truly can't

1685
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:48,130
attend our meetings before we subsidize

1686
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:51,940
people who are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be here anyway</font>

1687
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:54,310
so I'd support doing it but I provide

1688
01:15:51,940 --> 01:16:02,559
support doing it after we got more

1689
01:15:54,310 --> 01:16:04,600
people here on scholarship so I was

1690
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to say you know as Todd points out</font>

1691
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:08,020
i was on the pc for four years and i

1692
01:16:06,610 --> 01:16:09,519
complained bitterly the entire time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1693
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:11,800
didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> me in for free and i had to</font>

1694
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:13,690
actually turn out content to which was

1695
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,670
not a bad thing but the reality is

1696
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:18,250
you've got a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are doing</font>

1697
01:16:15,670 --> 01:16:20,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of work and not everyone works for</font>

1698
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:22,480
big companies not everyone can afford to

1699
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,519
just have these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> paid for and show</font>

1700
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,830
up at every meeting there are people who

1701
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,480
want to contribute and they shouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1702
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:30,610
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> out as a hardship case they</font>

1703
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:32,169
shouldn't be it's not right to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1704
01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:33,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">it like that there are people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who want</font>

1705
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,990
to contribute there are people who do

1706
01:16:33,370 --> 01:16:36,970
way more than the minimum amount of work

1707
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:38,230
required and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they deserve a</font>

1708
01:16:36,970 --> 01:16:40,890
little something for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of work</font>

1709
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:40,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they put into this</font>

1710
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:50,009
my head lad<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on the nano pc so i have</font>

1711
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,659
two points to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make real quick one was</font>

1712
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:53,969
regarding the the point raised earlier

1713
01:16:51,659 --> 01:16:56,400
that pc members know what they are

1714
01:16:53,969 --> 01:16:57,719
signing up for before they do and the

1715
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,259
counter that i would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to put there</font>

1716
01:16:57,719 --> 01:17:02,909
is that a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of times managers change</font>

1717
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:04,739
your own job titles change and your own

1718
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:07,230
jobs change<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's not always the</font>

1719
01:17:04,739 --> 01:17:09,209
case of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-year period the second</font>

1720
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:10,949
point that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask is we've</font>

1721
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:12,659
discussed the whole black and white

1722
01:17:10,949 --> 01:17:14,339
situation either you pay everything or

1723
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:17,219
you don't pay anything has there been

1724
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:18,989
like a fifty percent discount kind of

1725
01:17:17,219 --> 01:17:22,139
situation discussed before because

1726
01:17:18,989 --> 01:17:23,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a balance between you know the</font>

1727
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:28,369
financials and getting some recognition

1728
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:31,440
for putting time on the pc thank you I

1729
01:17:28,369 --> 01:17:35,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">David</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> huberman from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron again it's</font>

1730
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:38,400
October 2011 this is the first meeting

1731
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:41,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">only on our own I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> urge the board</font>

1732
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:43,888
to be second meeting birds the<font color="#CCCCCC"> birds to</font>

1733
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:46,679
be fully conservative maybe for the

1734
01:17:43,889 --> 01:17:48,570
februari 2013 meeting when you've had a

1735
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:50,909
full year's worth of meetings to really

1736
01:17:48,570 --> 01:17:52,619
understand what your finances really

1737
01:17:50,909 --> 01:17:55,799
look like and not what they look like

1738
01:17:52,619 --> 01:17:57,780
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I just think this discussion</font>

1739
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,699
is premature until you have a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

1740
01:17:57,780 --> 01:18:02,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot on what your finances are going to</font>

1741
01:17:59,699 --> 01:18:07,589
be in red if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't afford to</font>

1742
01:18:02,369 --> 01:18:09,329
do this thank you my name is Patrick I'm

1743
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:12,349
a Down Dog member I've been silent on

1744
01:18:09,329 --> 01:18:14,820
this issue up to this point because I

1745
01:18:12,349 --> 01:18:16,469
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> told in the past that I have a</font>

1746
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:18,480
really loud voice so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1747
01:18:16,469 --> 01:18:19,650
whisper I also didn't want people to

1748
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,968
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that I was speaking for the board</font>

1749
01:18:19,650 --> 01:18:22,320
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the community meeting and</font>

1750
01:18:20,969 --> 01:18:25,050
I'm speaking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for myself not for the</font>

1751
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:27,179
board so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way I look at this is that</font>

1752
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:28,949
first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I think it's completely</font>

1753
01:18:27,179 --> 01:18:30,989
wrong to assume<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're creating two</font>

1754
01:18:28,949 --> 01:18:32,669
classes of membership or you can go

1755
01:18:30,989 --> 01:18:33,928
ahead and assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is two classes and</font>

1756
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:35,820
membership and yeah somebody who

1757
01:18:33,929 --> 01:18:37,199
volunteers and puts their time in there

1758
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:39,058
a different class and I'm okay with that

1759
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:41,400
either way you think about it I don't

1760
01:18:39,059 --> 01:18:44,130
care<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think about is if nanog</font>

1761
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,799
could write a check if nu nog

1762
01:18:44,130 --> 01:18:48,599
incorporated could write a check for

1763
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:50,760
$425 you get somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put the 60</font>

1764
01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:54,389
hours or whatever it is that people like

1765
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:56,699
Dave and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Raz and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dave sorry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to dave's</font>

1766

1767
01:18:56,699 --> 01:19:00,839
people on the pc who actually contribute

1768
01:18:58,349 --> 01:19:02,550
if we could write a check for<font color="#CCCCCC"> $425 and</font>

1769
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:06,360
get them to contribute that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wouldn't</font>

1770
01:19:02,550 --> 01:19:11,010
blink<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would do it in a heartbeat in</font>

1771
01:19:06,360 --> 01:19:13,949
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jump for joy to do it we</font>

1772
01:19:11,010 --> 01:19:15,989
had before this meeting started before

1773
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:18,329
people that were sitting up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a</font>

1774
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:20,959
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out in the audience went</font>

1775
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:24,570
and physically buttonholed literally

1776
01:19:20,959 --> 01:19:26,459
physically attacked people and asked

1777
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:30,349
them to volunteer for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> pc we had</font>

1778
01:19:26,459 --> 01:19:35,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">seven open slots with seven volunteers</font>

1779
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:36,510
we have four open board slots the people

1780
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:38,789
standing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for it are either sitting on</font>

1781
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:40,739
this table or have already<font color="#E5E5E5"> donated</font>

1782
01:19:38,789 --> 01:19:45,959
almost as much time as a normal board

1783
01:19:40,739 --> 01:19:48,860
member not one other person stood up not

1784
01:19:45,959 --> 01:19:51,749
one you guys talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff and</font>

1785
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:53,549
nobody's doing it and part of the reason

1786
01:19:51,749 --> 01:19:54,869
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason part of the reason</font>

1787
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:57,510
is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've talked to people who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1788
01:19:54,869 --> 01:20:00,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like to but and they need</font>

1789
01:19:57,510 --> 01:20:02,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and letting them come to the</font>

1790
01:20:00,119 --> 01:20:05,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">meeting that they helped create that</font>

1791
01:20:02,699 --> 01:20:07,938
they put the effort into doing on their

1792
01:20:05,849 --> 01:20:11,760
own without asking their employer

1793
01:20:07,939 --> 01:20:14,459
without asking for a hardship case which

1794
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,199
honestly is really demeaning without

1795
01:20:14,459 --> 01:20:18,090
doing something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and just</font>

1796
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:20,188
saying please you worked really hard on

1797
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:23,479
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean name another organization</font>

1798
01:20:20,189 --> 01:20:28,709
that puts on anything a concert a

1799
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:30,869
meeting a fair and anything and all the

1800
01:20:28,709 --> 01:20:32,760
volunteers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up who work the</font>

1801
01:20:30,869 --> 01:20:34,409
meeting who worked the concert who

1802
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:36,899
worked the fair and say wait a minute

1803
01:20:34,409 --> 01:20:40,409
before you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in give me some dough</font>

1804
01:20:36,899 --> 01:20:43,649
not one I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of one literally</font>

1805
01:20:40,409 --> 01:20:45,148
that isn't a flat-out charity and as

1806
01:20:43,649 --> 01:20:46,769
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we like to talk to ourselves as</font>

1807
01:20:45,149 --> 01:20:49,499
a charity we're actually not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> flat-out</font>

1808
01:20:46,769 --> 01:20:50,999
charity it's nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give people you</font>

1809
01:20:49,499 --> 01:20:53,398
know we can talk about scholarships and

1810
01:20:50,999 --> 01:20:57,570
it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> I personally carry you</font>

1811
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:59,159
know I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped Wilson show him</font>

1812
01:20:57,570 --> 01:21:00,808
who people were around here today he's

1813
01:20:59,159 --> 01:21:02,518
the postelles scholarship winner this

1814
01:21:00,809 --> 01:21:04,199
year and I think it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

1815
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:07,150
had two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those I think it'd be even</font>

1816
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:16,759
greater if we had a contested election

1817
01:21:07,150 --> 01:21:20,360
that's my view just a minute oh

1818
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:22,640
absolutely so we are over time I think

1819
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is an important conversation I just</font>

1820
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:27,350
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to call it out so should we give</font>

1821
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:32,000
ourselves on our seven minutes and close

1822
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:34,370
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> two fifteen I'm sure we can find we</font>

1823
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:36,980
can find more time to discuss this but

1824
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:40,760

1827
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:48,710
don't need a little time to

1828
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:50,990
organizations including this one and

1829
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:54,260
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the call went to help especially</font>

1830
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:57,590
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> the second call went out I said you</font>

1831
01:21:54,260 --> 01:22:00,800
know I could do it again and I went

1832
01:21:57,590 --> 01:22:04,100
looked and my criterion wasn't whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1833
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,770
could come up with 450 bucks my criteria

1834
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:12,740
is which do nothing blow arts<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:14,960
have to listen to 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years hey let's be</font>

1836
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:17,240
clear<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone sitting up here donated</font>

1837
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,070
all their time not one of us has ever

1838
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:20,389
been paid a cent for any of this and if

1839
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:22,700
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we put in a lot of</font>

1840
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:24,500
time you're confused there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of</font>

1841
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:27,700
blowhards if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think somebody's</font>

1842
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:29,540
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to join the pc and do the work</font>

1843
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:31,429
remember we're talking about doing the

1844
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,450
work not just joining the pc so if you

1845
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:37,160
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> think somebody's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to join</font>

1846
01:22:32,450 --> 01:22:41,330
the pc for 450 425 dollars and we're not

1847
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:47,450
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let them skate but you're</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really talking 1275 dollars</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mmm he's</font>

1849
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:52,150
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about why he randy said he's</font>

1850
01:22:48,980 --> 01:22:52,150
talking about why he didn't volunteer

1851
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:55,510
nah

1852
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:01,410
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> given his point of view right and</font>

1853
01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:03,180
it's 850 cuz ya'll have to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two but</font>

1854
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:07,590
you if you went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to three yes it'd be</font>

1855
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:08,850
1212<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm so not you know a fairly small</font>

1856
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:11,100
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of money for the amount of work</font>

1857
01:23:08,850 --> 01:23:13,140
that people put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't think of</font>

1858
01:23:11,100 --> 01:23:14,340
them I can't imagine that when you look

1859
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:16,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the budget that we're talking about</font>

1860
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:18,810
them that the money is the big deal

1861
01:23:16,890 --> 01:23:20,760
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of money to the</font>

1862
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:23,010
organization and if our development

1863
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:25,290
chairs as good as her track record so

1864
01:23:23,010 --> 01:23:27,239
far it should become less and less of an

1865
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:29,519
issue as we go on so I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

1866
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:31,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">the money is the issue if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1867
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the issue then it's obviously people's</font>

1868
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:36,239
own personal opinions on whether those

1869
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:38,489
seats should be should be free or people

1870
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:41,669
would have to pay just like everybody

1871
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:43,080
else and quite honestly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> my opinion</font>

1872
01:23:41,670 --> 01:23:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">it doesn't it doesn't really matter</font>

1873
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:47,040
which way it goes if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1874
01:23:45,690 --> 01:23:48,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">people should be compensated for their</font>

1875
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:51,090
time I'm fine with that and use the

1876
01:23:48,930 --> 01:23:54,180
board you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> my permission as a member</font>

1877
01:23:51,090 --> 01:23:56,160
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> decision for us but if you</font>

1878
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:57,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that that's been this way and it</font>

1879
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,220
should continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this way you</font>

1880
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">should pay just like everybody else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

1881
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:05,880
fine with that too you guys make up your

1882
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:08,670
minds I have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> end along</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hurricane</font>

1883
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,310
electric and manage member I have to

1884
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:16,620
agree with Patrick I have not seen any

1885
01:24:11,310 --> 01:24:19,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">of can somebody write this date down and</font>

1886
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:22,590
I'm agreeing with with rads<font color="#E5E5E5"> to which is</font>

1887
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:26,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">really Patrick and has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just changed</font>

1888
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:29,880
their point of view just now it wouldn't

1889
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:31,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">surprise me anyway</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there is no</font>

1890
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">other organization that I'm aware of</font>

1891
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:36,000
that makes you pay for the privilege of

1892
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,890
serving the organization other than

1893
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,480
right which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little different thing</font>

1894
01:24:39,890 --> 01:24:45,210
right right board members not only get

1895
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:46,530
their membership if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you speak at a ripe</font>

1896
01:24:45,210 --> 01:24:48,360
conference for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> use all the</font>

1897
01:24:46,530 --> 01:24:51,750
papers i often but right board members

1898
01:24:48,360 --> 01:24:54,940
not only get their attendance free they

1899
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:57,820
get their travel paid

1900
01:24:54,940 --> 01:25:01,059
so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know meeting</font>

1901
01:24:57,820 --> 01:25:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">attendance for the the committee members</font>

1902
01:25:01,060 --> 01:25:06,930
is is a bare minimum I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1903
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:08,769
fact that we have such a dismal slate of

1904
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:09,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">Canada and I'm not talking about the</font>

1905
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,680
quality of the candidates I'm talking

1906
01:25:09,969 --> 01:25:13,570
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the fact that we have a number of</font>

1907
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:17,290
candidates that barely equals the number

1908
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:19,449
of open positions is a dismal state and

1909
01:25:17,290 --> 01:25:22,030
I think that this organization deserves

1910
01:25:19,449 --> 01:25:25,030
better and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that the way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get a</font>

1911
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:27,730
better set of choices is to make it

1912
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:29,290
easier for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to volunteer and if</font>

1913
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:31,839
giving them free meeting attendance is

1914
01:25:29,290 --> 01:25:33,430
what it takes to do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then I think</font>

1915
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the least we can do as an</font>

1916
01:25:33,430 --> 01:25:37,180
organization to support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and make</font>

1917
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:40,059
the organization healthier and more

1918
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:42,370
viable thank you so we'll go we have

1919
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:43,810
four more minutes one minute each three

1920
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:51,130

1921
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:55,660
one more<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think Fergus was first</font>

1922
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:58,690
reference I focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> my complex optics I'm</font>

1923
01:25:55,660 --> 01:26:00,849
a right working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group chair I would</font>

1924
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:03,849
share<font color="#CCCCCC"> within the right community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1925
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:05,560
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> my expenses paid the ripe NCC which</font>

1926
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:07,930
is the executive arm of the right

1927
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">community as an elected board that gets</font>

1928
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:13,570
expenses but none of the worker group

1929
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:17,820
chairs none of the pc people get their

1930
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:22,059
expenses paid or free meetings thank you

1931
01:26:17,820 --> 01:26:25,389
so Dave tempt him you know so basically

1932
01:26:22,060 --> 01:26:26,800
I wanted to echo a point that Patrick

1933
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:28,780
made which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know a lot of people</font>

1934
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:32,080
brought up well we should create a

1935
01:26:28,780 --> 01:26:34,210
hardship case you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how</font>

1936
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,309
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people have gone to school with</font>

1937
01:26:34,210 --> 01:26:38,230
people who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know may have been under</font>

1938
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:39,820
privileged but no one really liked the

1939
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:42,009
feeling of having to know that their

1940
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:44,019
parents had<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go ask for a subsidized</font>

1941
01:26:42,010 --> 01:26:45,850
lunch and I'm pretty sure that no one

1942
01:26:44,020 --> 01:26:48,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">wants to have to go to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana court</font>

1943
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:52,719
and ask for a subsidized registration

1944
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:54,699
you know it's demeaning to some extent I

1945
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,830
guess people could get over it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1946
01:26:54,699 --> 01:26:59,290
doubt many people would use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

1947
01:26:56,830 --> 01:27:02,590
would end up losing people who otherwise

1948
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:04,810
may not be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attend the other side</font>

1949
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:07,030
of that as well is that our employers

1950
01:27:04,810 --> 01:27:07,280
who have generously given this time for

1951
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:09,800
us

1952
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,420
to use here should not be forced to pay

1953
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:14,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">for this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or we shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be forced</font>

1954
01:27:11,420 --> 01:27:19,159
to pay<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it out of pocket if our</font>

1955
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:22,308
employers have contributed our time to

1956
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:23,900
this process thanks thanks I'm used to

1957
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:26,510
Patrick misunderstanding me so I didn't

1958
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:27,949
react then but since I<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously said</font>

1959
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:29,570
what I'm saying incorrectly if Dave

1960
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:31,610
misunderstood me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was saying we have a</font>

1961
01:27:29,570 --> 01:27:34,849

1964
01:27:38,599 --> 01:27:44,000
wish to codify something then we should

1965
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:46,159
have the discretion that not separate

1966
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:47,659
from hardship case just say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1967
01:27:46,159 --> 01:27:50,089
know committee members that actually do

1968
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:53,769
the bloody work by some criteria that as

1969
01:27:50,090 --> 01:27:56,630
you alluded to before would be would be

1970
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:58,340
comped not just a blanket comp whereby

1971
01:27:56,630 --> 01:28:02,840
somebody who could skate and we have

1972
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:06,050
Patrick had people who skated and we may

1973
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:07,880
still do I don't know not inside so we

1974
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:11,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">wouldn't just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give freebies of people</font>

1975
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:13,070
who escaped just so everybody knows as

1976
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:15,050
far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know and somebody can help me</font>

1980
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:24,139
wasn't a speaker or or a sponsor when

1981
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:27,619
they get so many / being a sponsor is

1982
01:28:24,139 --> 01:28:30,440
that right yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay just a data point</font>

1983
01:28:27,619 --> 01:28:33,259
not trying to say anything else one last

1984
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:36,860
interview yep that's all I got and I'll

1985
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:38,570
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> fast um I mean could we try it you</font>

1986
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:40,250
know try it for a couple you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year</font>

1987
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:44,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">or something like that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and if we have a</font>

1988
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:46,820
positive uptake in in people who want to

1989
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,590
apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> for positions / stand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for election</font>

1990
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:50,150
could be then say oh this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

1991
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:52,280
program let's keep going if we don't

1992
01:28:50,150 --> 01:28:53,989
have a positive uptake in the same we're

1993
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:55,400
in the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> place next year where we</font>

1994
01:28:53,989 --> 01:28:57,678
have the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of people who want</font>

1995
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:00,019
the same number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of positions maybe we</font>

1996
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:02,750
could say that this isn't this clearly

1997
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:04,280
isn't working I mean I would think that

1998
01:29:02,750 --> 01:29:06,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would be the next logical step is</font>

1999
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:08,420
it if we're truly not getting qualified

2000
01:29:06,289 --> 01:29:11,119
candidates for our for the positions and

2001
01:29:08,420 --> 01:29:13,650
the reason one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why we're</font>

2002
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:15,120
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> is because it's a hardship on</font>

2003
01:29:13,650 --> 01:29:16,230
they're not getting competir their

2004
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,660
employers don't want to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them or</font>

2005
01:29:16,230 --> 01:29:19,799
what have you then then if we see a huge

2006
01:29:18,660 --> 01:29:21,980
uptake and people who want these

2007
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:24,540
positions then we'll know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this this</font>

2008
01:29:21,980 --> 01:29:26,549
program has worked if we still have the

2009
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:28,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">same we're still at the same place then</font>

2010
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:30,240
obviously we probably have better places

2011
01:29:28,170 --> 01:29:31,890
to spend twenty two thousand some odd

2012
01:29:30,240 --> 01:29:33,300
dollars or what have you if you're

2013
01:29:31,890 --> 01:29:35,250
saying we should we test it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just realize</font>

2014
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:37,920
this entire thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a test I guess I</font>

2015
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:39,780
got you<font color="#E5E5E5"> I and I got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can but I'm just</font>

2016
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,340
saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people are saying there's a</font>

2017
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:42,929
lot of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are saying and have</font>

2018
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:43,830
puts their their opinion on futures that

2019
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're going to get better slate of</font>

2020
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:47,130
candidates if you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I'm saying</font>

2021
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,660
okay I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily have an</font>

2022
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:50,040
objection to that why don't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> try it</font>

2023
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:51,360
and see if it works if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a better</font>

2024
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,860
slate of candidates we know that it

2025
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:54,150
works and we can go forward with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

2026
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:55,980
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same before in the same place</font>

2027
01:29:54,150 --> 01:29:57,929
next year then we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this didn't</font>

2028
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:59,280
work and we should probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it's a</font>

2029
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:02,310
waste of<font color="#E5E5E5"> twenty two thousand dollars</font>

2030
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:06,360
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good suggestion so we will</font>

2031
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:08,660
close for now<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this on this topic so i</font>

2032
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:12,269
encourage you all to come to the social

2033
01:30:08,660 --> 01:30:16,139
that's put out by comcast our<font color="#E5E5E5"> host it is</font>
