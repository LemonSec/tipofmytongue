00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,290
quick this is actually a just an update

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,549
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's happening in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron</font>

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,680
and what's happening at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the meeting at</font>

the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> half of the week I'm a</font>

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,660

8
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,299
these slides and go change your flights

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,980
I don't expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone to decide they</font>

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,109
have to stay in Philadelphia or a few

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,910
more days but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a public policy</font>

12
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,930
mailing list and occasionally get some

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,180
email we have a we have the ability to

14
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,579
participate remotely so if you see a

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,579
policy that you're interested in and you

16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,680

after the fact years later when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put</font>

have 5.7 / eights now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't count</font>

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,500
a few things like a substantial portion

34
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,929
of one /a was the space returned by

35
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,479
interrupt and that is actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> space</font>

36
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,979
that we held and it's presently under

37
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,170
discussion in the Aaron region of

38
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,960
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that space to be returned</font>

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,270
outside the region to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iono whether</font>

40
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,490
or not that space that should be go to

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,759
the IANA free pool for reallocation if

42
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,189
we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> global policy so I say 5.7 but</font>

43
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,680
take one and set it aside there's also a

44
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,059
public policy a discussion right now in

45
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,979
the Aaron region it's actually been

46
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,500
approved but set aside by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the board for</font>

47
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,750
IETF coordination in the IETF they're

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,070
currently working on an internet draft

49
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,500
the number of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room</font>

50
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:07,740
actually I see faces who have worked on

51
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">various parts of that to set aside a</font>

52
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,710
block of address space for purposes of

53
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,230
transition technology

54
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,690
so we could lose a / 10 to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

55
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:20,280
then we do have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of space and the</font>

56
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,829
rate of requests going into<font color="#CCCCCC"> erin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's moderated at this point it</font>

62
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,330
looks like we'll have space available

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,820
under<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current policies probably</font>

64
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,860
through the end of 2012 now actually

65
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">this guy who does much better job than</font>

mr. Houston<font color="#CCCCCC"> now he has other ideas on</font>

69
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,100
when this is for planning purposes in a

70
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,480
bad horizon obviously could change but

71
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:57,570
we do expect to have space through the

72
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,310
end of this year and through 2012 but

73
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:01,560
that of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is right around the</font>

74
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,020
corner if you're planning a network so

75
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,000
we have space you can put in requests

76
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,280
not a problem remember that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're an</font>

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISP you get space based on three months</font>

78
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,440
based on documented need that means that

79
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,330
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot less space than you did</font>

80
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,829
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even more</font>

81
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,460
frequently when you come to get your

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,470
next block specified transfer policy

83
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:27,090
let's say you want 13 months or let's

84
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:29,490
say that you decide that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

85
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,380
address space and you've decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

86
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,940
for one reason or another you want a

87
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:35,340
particular address block or you have an

88
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:37,200
address block that you already<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font>

now clean<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the records we have the</font>

94
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,339
you can transfer address space to

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,010
another party if they need it they have

96
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:55,020
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet the same policies up to 12</font>

months of their anticipated

98
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,300
forward-looking demand now we don't

99
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:01,740
match people who have address space with

100
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,360
people who need address space we have

101
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:05,490
some mechanisms that make that<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible</font>

102
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,710
but it's all up to you there's actually

00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,020
people out there in emerging industry as

00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:13,740
it were of people willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> match</font>

105
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,180
buyers and sellers and if you want to

106
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,030
make sure the person you're dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

107

is someone who's actually the address

want to make sure the person you're

doing that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually set up a</font>

obtain space up to 24 months that they

195

see rather than asking what would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> 8</font>

times asking Aaron for their next three

months worth of space the advantages of

198
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,599
having a lower policy obviously for what

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get from Aaron's free pool is that</font>

when we run out your your neighbor isp

won't have just gotten a year's worth of

203
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,650

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:13,159
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of getting it in similar increments</font>

205
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,419
but applying a year for transfer policy

206
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,889
you're thinking if you go through the

207
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,198
work or finding someone getting an

208

with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aaron getting it transferred and</font>

210
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,810
then you only get 12 months worth people

211
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:26,389
are thinking potentially that should be

212
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,860
longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously the other side of that</font>

213
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:30,830
is well if it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be longer how</font>

214
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,520
long should it be so pros and cons to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

215
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:36,890
discussed Aaron 2011-13 ipv4 number

resources<font color="#CCCCCC"> for use within the region this</font>

217
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,458
would say that resources that are

totally within the Aaron region so

220
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:48,199
interesting policy since Aaron's regions

221
00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:50,140
changed over time but as it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

222
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,780
today it would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> our present region</font>

239

region we've had requests for resource

certification ie providing a way for

someone electronically to validate the

242
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:46,899
address hold or an address block and

243
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,279
this is done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> x509 technology</font>

few others the problem with with us in

250
00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:09,229
particular is it's a nice litigious

251
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,449
society so if you do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

252
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,709
to be prepared to be sued whether you do

it right<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whether you do it wrong</font>

254
00:10:12,709 --> 00:10:16,369
you're going to get sued and you just

255
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:19,520
have to prepare in advance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make sure</font>

256
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:21,800
you can defend yourself and with our PKA

257
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,140
it's very exciting because you're

258
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,660
effectively providing digital

certification that a particular dress

blocks held by a party now this

261
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,839
shouldn't be a problem because this is

what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> in who</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is already but the</font>

272
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:04,610
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> was busy doing this online video of</font>

your system generated a bad token okay

00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,489
now in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places they look at this</font>

generated it in something they call

00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,910
non-repudiation so what we've had to do

287
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:37,929
an errand is take what would be a fairly

simple system and engineer it to

289
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:43,670
overkill point to make sure that we have

290
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:48,109
non-repudiation to make sure that we

291
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:50,479
have the ability to survive a bad actor

292
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:52,549
either whether it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our internal</font>

293
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,730
employees or whether that's a party

294
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:58,069
relying on it and detect that and

295
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,279
recover from that so our rpki was a

296
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:06,378
little delayed we are doing our pki the

297
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:08,239
hosted rpki this is us issuing certs on

298
00:12:06,379 --> 00:12:12,319
behalf<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a block registered for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron</font>

299
00:12:08,239 --> 00:12:14,629
where we run the certificate authority

300
00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:17,569
and that's targeted for january first

301
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:19,279
and then they have a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> hour</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pki</font>

302
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,559
where you run the certificate authority

303
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,209
and as you generate search you pump them

304
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,160
up to us we sign them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we send them</font>

305
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,719
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you and that's for a company</font>

306
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,999
that's doing a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things like a</font>

307
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,269
large infrastructure would want to run

308
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:34,610
their own CA that's up down our pki and

309
00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:38,269
that's targeted for early next year so

we are moving ahead with our pki it's a
