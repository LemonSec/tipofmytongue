00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:07,300
bein so hi everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> name is richard</font>

2
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:09,309
barnes from BBN<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm actually the first</font>

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nana like it's andy i'm actually</font>

4
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:12,719
not an operator<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not a vendor and</font>

5
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:16,239
kind of an odd<font color="#CCCCCC"> duck here in some way so</font>

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,580
Matthew I hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a lot in the IETF off</font>

7
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:21,430
so I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> today about some</font>

8
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,720
technology that's sort of emerging also

9
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,730
my ETF stuff that's been emerging

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,220
related to geolocation and it's actually

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,810
kind of notches in really well being the

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,400
last talk not just in kind of well with

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,829
the first talk of the meeting that Dave

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,230
Ward gave talking about the possibility

15
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,510
that exposing some information from

16
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:39,669
networks exposing that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

17
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,260
to applications could really enable some

18
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,360
new stuff create some transformative

19
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,980
applications enable some really good

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,790
stuff and and improve the network

21
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,440
overall so with that so one of the

22
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,060
briefly review you know what the world

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,800
looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> today from from a geolocation</font>

24
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,989
perspective so we have this situation

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,199
where there's all sorts of applications

26
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,550
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants information about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

27
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,380
users of those applications are

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:03,430
physically located so this includes

29
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:05,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">things like traditional location</font>

30
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,170
location based services like you know

31
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:10,299
Foursquare I mean Yelp you know what's

32
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,229
the weather where I am what are movie

33
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:15,700
times where I am you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's show me</font>

34
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:19,149
some Chinese restaurants around where I

35
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:21,159
am typical location-based services so

36
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:22,959
those things fall<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this bin there's</font>

37
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:25,389
the thing that's been around for like a

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,950
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer is is things like content</font>

39
00:01:25,389 --> 00:01:28,990
localization and advertising

40
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:31,479
localization<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if you think</font>

41
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,859
about you know people like Google<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

42
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,420
Yahoo need to decide when I get a

43
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:37,059
request for an IP address do I serve

44
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:39,729
them google com or google.fr or

45
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,880
google.de since it's a very coarse and

46
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:44,229
it's not a visible form of geolocation a

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,658
lot of cases it's not something we're in

48
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,819
a user is explicitly saying show me

49
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:50,109
what's nearby me but it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you</font>

50
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:52,450
know it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical one for a lot of</font>

51
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:54,568
content providers to make sure that the

52
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:57,159
right content gets to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right users</font>

53
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,770
there's also you know an increasing

54
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,109
demand as valuable content gets revealed

55
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,929
to things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hulu through itunes to</font>

56
00:02:02,109 --> 00:02:06,880
control look access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> things based on</font>

57
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:08,348
on where people are so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

58
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">to open up my service to users in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the US</font>

59
00:02:08,348 --> 00:02:13,319
or in France and Germany but not in

60
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,679
Singapore or

61
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">japan there's also some emerging work</font>

62
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,310
and using location information for

63
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,709
things like fraud mitigation you know

64
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:25,439
how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I detect when an online purchase</font>

65
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:27,480
made with a credit card is fraudulent or

66
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,430
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> or maybe if there are speed of light</font>

67
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,899
constraints on you know being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used in</font>

68
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:32,700
one place and then being used in another

69
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,139
we can use it's at least as a heuristic

70
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,819
and detecting when there's some fraud

71
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:37,650
and going on so there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

72
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,108
applications here ranging from

73
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,700
advertising this fairly static stuff

74
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:43,950
about you know how we picked the right

75
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:46,129
version of Google or Yahoo or if I do

76
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,179
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that matter to present to people</font>

77
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,798
ranging all the way out to the much more

78
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,139
dynamic stuff like location-based social

79
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:55,409
networking restaurant recommendations

80
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:58,949
whether things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and right now</font>

81
00:02:55,409 --> 00:03:01,138
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are based on as they've put</font>

82
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:02,819
it on Monday scavenged information is

83
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">over the top services that I'll talk to</font>

84
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about in just a minute that that</font>

85
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:09,449
are kind of halfway work but have a lot

86
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:10,799
of problems and especially you know they

87
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:12,239
caused some problems for an operator

88
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:15,480
perspective at all i'll talk about in

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,919
just a second<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the hope that you know</font>

90
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,268
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

91
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,739
that maybe you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we create</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

92
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,379
interfaces from the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow</font>

93
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,639
operators to supply these applications

94
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,578
with some information we might be able

95
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">to improve</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this situation so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we look</font>

96
00:03:26,579 --> 00:03:31,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">at how these services work today they</font>

97
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:33,750
get location information from basically

98
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">two sources there are these third-party</font>

99
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,549
services that you know reside off of

100
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,040
devices they don't have any touch with

101
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,840
the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> at all when you know these</font>

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,948
have been around for<font color="#E5E5E5"> many many years so</font>

103
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,560
they go under the heading<font color="#E5E5E5"> of IP</font>

104
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:48,150
geodatabases<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are based on things</font>

105
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,310
like scraping information out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the who</font>

106
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,609
is databases you know if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> register my</font>

107
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,169
contact information as being in topeka

108
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:58,469
even if my network is in you know

109
00:03:55,169 --> 00:04:00,479
dearborn you know the who is people will

110
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,430
grab that who<font color="#CCCCCC"> has and say AHA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you should</font>

111
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,000
get ads for Chinese restaurants in

<font color="#CCCCCC">Topeka instead of in Michigan so that</font>

113
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,840
that has that failing you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

114
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">people are some of the more advanced</font>

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,739
services that do this stuff actually do

116
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,509
network mapping they do Trace routes and

117
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,370
things like that to try and infer to

118
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:18,988
apology and improve your estimates of

119
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,969
location based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> obviously</font>

120
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,279
there's given the divergences between

121
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:26,099
topology and geography there's some

122
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,680
pitfalls there as well and sometimes in

123
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,759
very

124
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,800
limited cases some of these services

125
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually buy information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from my SPS and</font>

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,990
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very limited and obviously can't</font>

127
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:39,310
cover much of the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that way so</font>

128
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:40,960
that that's sort of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view</font>

129
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,009
and those tend to be you know coarser

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,229
grain you know you can get sort of

131
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,539
country or state or maybe metro area

132
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:49,860
location out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those things with you</font>

133
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:51,820
know 90 95 inch percent accuracy<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll</font>

134
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,650
talk a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font>

135
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,719
just a second the other class of

136
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,609
applicative location services we see our

137
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,960
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> i call first party here so if i've</font>

138
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:00,370
got an app that's actually running on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

139
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,440
device that's connected to the network

140
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:05,259
it can get a little bit more information

141
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we've got GPS things</font>

142
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,860
obviously where that works so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works</font>

143
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,110
well in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm driving in a</font>

144
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,729
car in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an open area sometimes that works</font>

145
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,370
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> well but if I'm inside of a</font>

146
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:17,680
building or in lots of urban areas it

147
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,990
really doesn't and so there's these

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,479
Wi-Fi<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cell databases that have shown</font>

149
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,110
up if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Android devices or</font>

150
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,810
iPhone devices or Windows Phone devices

151
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,599
blackberries all of those have services

152
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,849
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> device you know the phone will</font>

153
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:36,070
listen to Wi-Fi access points and cell

154
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:37,960
towers that are around it say I can see

155
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,820
these five access points in these three

156
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,138
cell towers and it'll send that off to

157
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,909
some service on the other side of the

158
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:44,919
network that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a database of access</font>

159
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,719
points<font color="#E5E5E5"> and cell towers and says okay so</font>

160
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:48,490
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> these things are in downtown</font>

161
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,830
Philadelphia so you are somewhere in

162
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">downtown Philadelphia and so you know</font>

163
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,330
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you use the iOS Maps application</font>

164
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,190
you'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you make you click the</font>

165
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,139
button<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> says where am I it will see</font>

166
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,849
this rough circle up here and that's the

167
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:02,590
network based thing that's this you know

168
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:04,930
Wi-Fi cellular base thing that will then

169
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,900
tighten down hopefully<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GPS thing if</font>

170
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,520
it works and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course the very</font>

171
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,500
last thing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're in a</font>

172
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">pontiff devices just have the user say</font>

173
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,880
where they are you can ask ask the user

174
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:18,220
where are you and use that as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font>

175
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,550
option and that surprisingly enough is

176
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:23,530
how most 911 services operate for voice

177
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,940
over IP so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at you know if</font>

178
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,710
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was this mandate from the</font>

179
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">FCC a few years ago that voice over IP</font>

180
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,570
did services had to provide 911

181
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,889
emergency calling in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and if you</font>

182
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:34,870
look at how that's actually implemented

183
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:36,880
nowadays it's mostly by just asking the

184
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,860
user where they are which you know

185
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">despite all the pitfalls is the state of</font>

186
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:43,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">the art there right now</font>

187
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:45,039
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of the art across</font>

188
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:46,780
this is that the performance properties

189
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,220
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this whole system they're sort of</font>

190
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,469
good enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a lot of stuff done</font>

191
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,150
but they kind of suck still so if you

192
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">look at these IP geodatabases there's a</font>

193
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:56,159
whole lot of variability<font color="#E5E5E5"> kata actually</font>

194
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,210
did a very good study last year

195
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,950
comparing these databases which showed

196
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:02,020
you know they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> this variability from</font>

197
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:03,550
about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometer to sometimes many</font>

198
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:05,080
hundreds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometers sometimes many</font>

199
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,990
thousands<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kilometers in completely</font>

200
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:09,340
different countries and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

201
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,230
dependence on what sort of network type

202
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,659
you're in so if you're in a DSL or<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiber</font>

203
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,220
cable network they're pretty good but

204
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,980
they're much worse in mobile networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

205
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:20,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">tend to backhaul over longer distances</font>

206
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,480
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ggs NS and a really important thing</font>

207
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,979
to try and tie this in with the rest of

208
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">the morning is that these databases</font>

209
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:28,360
right now have little to no coverage of

210
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,370
ipv6 there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of databases that</font>

211
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,110
have some experimental support but by

212
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,090
and large they're there is no generic I

213
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:39,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">pgo for ipv6 so this is a real failing</font>

214
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:43,030
in the mobile space in these first party

215
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:45,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">aap is um you know if you've got GPS and</font>

216
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,159
GPS works then then then you're kind of

217
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,080
in good shape but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the performance</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

218
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,150
these wireless databases<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cellular</font>

219
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,250
and Wi-Fi access point databases is

220
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,799
really an open question because you

221
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,480
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're based on the people who</font>

222
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,680
operate the databases going around and

223
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,870
collecting the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> there there's</font>

224
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,150
no central registry of Wi-Fi access

225
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,770
points anywhere so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">service based on Wi-Fi you have to drive</font>

227
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">around or you have to have you know you</font>

mobile phones<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android phones report</font>

00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,180
information about access points they

230
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,210
observe and things like that and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

231
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the scavenge database that has you</font>

232
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,109
know obviously variable data quality

233
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,450
variable amounts of coverage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

234
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:24,220
what I'm actually working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a study of</font>

235
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,840
this and what we expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find is that</font>

236
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,070
in urban areas there's probably pretty

237
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,380
good coverage but if you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> out into</font>

238
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,210
rural areas or developing nations you

239
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,559
know there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably much much less</font>

240
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:37,809
fidelity there and if you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> finally</font>

241
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:40,030
at fixed networks so you know looking at

242
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:41,859
this this first party perspective what

243
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:43,120
we're in the device it fixed networks

244
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,700
they're pretty well covered by these IP

245
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,560
geodatabases but if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanting any sort</font>

246
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,150
of greater fidelity than that greater

247
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,709
than<font color="#CCCCCC"> this one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometer precision like</font>

248
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,600
you would need<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a 911 service you</font>

249
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,649
really do need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> user and of</font>

250
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,910
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> that gets stale</font>

251
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,220
very quickly if someone takes a device

252
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,290
from one house to another and and you're

253
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of out of luck so the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

254
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:03,279
you know you know when<font color="#CCCCCC"> things go wrong</font>

255
00:09:01,149 --> 00:09:05,170
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we fix them and right now this is</font>

256
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,209
you know emails to the nanog mailing

257
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:12,118
list seem to be the primary mechanism

258
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:15,790
for this give it in the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

259
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:17,709
geodatabase context<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's if</font>

260
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,290
there's problems in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> David databases</font>

261
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:21,849
obviously you need to detect them as an

262
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:23,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">application provider and then go fix</font>

263
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,720
them on a database by database basis so

264
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:27,459
you know there's actually this wiki here

265
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,139
that says here's how you go submit these

266
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:31,449
web forms or something right emails on a

267
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:33,100
database by database basis assuming you

268
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:35,498
can detect what's going on what's going

269
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,829
wrong and figure out which database is

270
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:40,240
that you've gone wrong in and if the

271
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:42,008
database you've gone wrong and happens

272
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,929
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> not be on that wiki page and no one's</font>

273
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:45,279
figured it out yet we get these emails

274
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,019
to the nanog mailing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that I</font>

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,699
scanning back through the archive show

00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:50,079
you know a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> times a month on the</font>

277
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:52,329
order of<font color="#CCCCCC"> one to five times a month so</font>

278
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,949
it's kind of a an awkward situation for

279
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,149
operators that you know you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got your</font>

right version of Google especially

283
00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:02,050
outside the US where it's determining

284
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:04,029
what language the content is delivered

285
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:05,439
in much more frequently they want to get

286
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:08,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">google or they want to get yahoo in the</font>

00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:10,480
right language and when they don't you

288
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,519
know it you get help desk calls at the I

289

you know you're at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP because you</font>

know Google doesn't work right for me

here why is it in German<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead of</font>

292
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:21,609
Dutch and then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> try and go and</font>

293
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:23,620
fix this you have to fish around and

294
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:25,269
find the right place to stick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in so</font>

295
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:28,199
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is can we find a better way</font>

296
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:30,009
to do this so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of</font>

297
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:32,290
technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are emerging to do</font>

298
00:10:30,009 --> 00:10:34,209
this and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what we're hoping to</font>

299
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,920
provide here in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

300
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:38,619
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> avenues for this is to provide</font>

301
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,209
some channel where the ISP who owns the

302
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,129
physical infrastructure and knows where

303
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,170
things are can provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

304
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:45,549
authoritative information up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

305
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:48,549
applications that want to know where

306
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:49,990
things are so you know as as on the

307
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:51,579
previous slide there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a</font>

308
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:55,600
channel for that information now there's

309
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:59,709
these individual / database web forms

310
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,939
email contacts things like that but

311
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:03,429
there's not any sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of automated</font>

312
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:05,379
universal system that that everyone can

313
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,949
feed off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be simple for people</font>

314
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:09,620
to operate

315
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,240
in terms of the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation and</font>

316
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:13,190
the upshot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you we see</font>

317
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,960
fairly frequent failures for the

318
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:18,200
applications fairly frequent failures

319
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:20,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">that users see and and on the operator</font>

320
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,620
side there's not really any<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to fix</font>

321
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">this when you have an unhappy subscriber</font>

322
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,940
so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to briefly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chat to talk</font>

323
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:29,780
through a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different avenues</font>

324
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">for for fixing this problem I'll sort of</font>

325
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:35,030
go in in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order from from worst to best</font>

326
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:37,280
so the one that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been getting a little</font>

327
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,079
bit of press lately is is this injection

328
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,550
system so there was a startup called

329
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">Feva there's another one called bearing</font>

330
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,660
media and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys are doing is</font>

331
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,250
they're building transparent HTTP

332
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,370
proxies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can put into routers</font>

333
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:52,040
and so what happens with these is when a

334
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:54,710
user sends an HTTP request out the

335
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,540
router<font color="#E5E5E5"> or the proxy that's sitting in</font>

336
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,830
the router sees this HTTP<font color="#E5E5E5"> request go</font>

337
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,719
through and it talks to<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

338
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,190
infrastructure in the back end talks to

339
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,200
some isp infrastructure radius

340
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:06,770
infrastructure and says hey where is

341
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:09,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">this IP address and it gets back an</font>

342
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:12,050
encrypted result that can only be read

343
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,400
by this demographics provider and it

344
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,380
sticks that encrypted result into an

345
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,790
HTTP header that<font color="#E5E5E5"> then gets you know</font>

346
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,760
conveyed to this web server of an

347
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:21,380
advertiser something like that so this

348
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">is kind of terrible in a couple of</font>

349
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,660
different dimensions first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all it</font>

350
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:29,360
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> works for HTTP so if i have a VoIP</font>

351
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,579
application or a 911 application that's

352
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,330
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that do its job using some</font>

353
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:36,560
protocol other than HTTP this system

354
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,470
doesn't do anything for it at all and

355
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,930
second it's it's really really awful<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

356
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:43,640
from a privacy perspective so I share

357
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,949
the geo print working groups like I care

358
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,600
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot about geolocation and privacy and</font>

359
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:50,060
if you look at this it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a couple of</font>

360
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,990
really really bad privacy properties one

361
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:57,199
you know users have no idea to how to

362
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:59,210
connect when this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done um you</font>

363
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,710
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's if you look at what</font>

364
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,030
providers tend to do when they enable

365
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,400
this sort of stuff they will contact

366
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:06,470
their users and say hey we are providing

367
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,930
your location information to some people

368
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,060
sometimes you know say if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

369
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:12,979
turn this off usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> without</font>

370
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,020
specification where it's going when it's

371
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:17,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">going there and usually with only a</font>

372
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,120
binary option for users to turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

373
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,070
off to protect their privacy

374
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so there's this limited very</font>

375
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,300
limited privacy control channel there

376
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:28,400
and if I'm a user I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even detect</font>

377
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,740
when this is going on right so it only

378
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,060
goes out in HTTP requests I can't see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

379
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,760
in the response that comes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

380
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:36,529
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if I set up a test server it's</font>

381
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,360
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> been being injected when it goes to</font>

382
00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:40,580
specific advertisers<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the provider</font>

383
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,800
is partnered with and so it won't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

384
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">my test server I can't see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it so yeah</font>

385
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,520
this is it's it's sort of interesting as

386
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:49,339
a proof of concepts that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know there</font>

387
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,949
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way that that operators can provide</font>

388
00:13:49,339 --> 00:13:53,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">information out to applications but it's</font>

389
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:55,220
maybe not the<font color="#CCCCCC"> long range path in terms</font>

390
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:56,959
of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that works for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

391
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,230
applications and something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a</font>

392
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:02,029
reasonable privacy story so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second</font>

393
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,100
one that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit better is this</font>

394
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:05,689
an effort that's going on in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> GSMA</font>

395
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,630
community in the mobile community called

396
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:12,440
one API and what this is is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

397
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:14,390
suite of rest based http-based what they

398
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,570
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> network api's that open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up access</font>

399
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,189
to various network services for

400
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,200
applications to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage of so</font>

401
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,320
there's a geolocation<font color="#E5E5E5"> API there's an SMS</font>

402
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,390
api allows you to send<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS messages over</font>

403
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">HTTP there's a charging api that allows</font>

404
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:31,160
you to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know ask for money from a</font>

405
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,099
user and one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's nice</font>

406
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,810
about this is that in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to being</font>

407
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:39,320
easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to program for cuz</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's rest in</font>

408
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:41,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">json over HTTP it actually has sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

409
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,610
an authorization story so the IETF and

410
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:45,560
some of the web community even working

411
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:49,550
on this Oh auth thing as a way of

412
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:51,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">providing delegated authorization and so</font>

413
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:54,260
the whole idea of the OAuth system is

414
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a user that has some</font>

415
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,730
resource that he has control<font color="#E5E5E5"> over so in</font>

416
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:01,459
this case I might be the user and

417
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Verizon is my wireless provider might be</font>

418
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:06,170
the one that holds that resource and so

419
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:09,140
off provides a technology for for me to

420
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,390
automate automatically delegate access

421
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,660
to that resource so access to my

422
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:18,410
location to some app and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might say</font>

423
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,260
hey verizon you should let Foursquare

424
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,029
use my location through this API so

425
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,250
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something of a privacy story</font>

426
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:29,270
developing here in terms of controlling

427
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:31,070
that access via the user the challenge

428
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:32,839
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we were to sort of consider this</font>

429
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,800
you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a path toward</font>

430
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,720
something for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

431
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,329
that there's there's still a little bit

432
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,950
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology missing so the critical</font>

433
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of making it work is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

434
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,709
there's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to find the right</font>

435
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,230
person to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for a given</font>

436
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,699
subscriber so one of the overall themes

437
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,100
here is that there's not really a

438
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,720
database a single database that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

439
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,120
for every subscriber in the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

440
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,440
there's no single database<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know</font>

441
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,690
there's no one that knows about

442
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,269
verizon's users as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> SingTel's</font>

443
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:01,100
users as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> dr. telecoms users as</font>

444
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:03,050
well as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Armenian telecoms users</font>

445
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,250
right so we need to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

446
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,920
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make an application that's</font>

447
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:09,380
globally deployable we need to discover

448
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,479
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a given subscriber</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where which</font>

449
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,089
database which geolocation service I

450
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,950
should talk to and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is built</font>

451
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:17,300
more for a statically configured thing

452
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,980
where I can look at say a telephone

453
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">number and say okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a verizon</font>

454
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,430
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll go to verizon service i'll</font>

455
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,540
go to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ATT service for this number so</font>

456
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,839
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that challenge there's also a</font>

457
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:33,709
few sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> gsm telephone specific</font>

458
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,910
things in the API itself that that would

459
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,170
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be squared away if we were going</font>

460
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:40,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">to try and consider this for the</font>

461
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:44,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet so in a third thread there's</font>

462
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:48,020
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> an effort in the IETF to do to have</font>

463
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:50,240
to create a system that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can improve</font>

464
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,730
provide a geolocation service for the

465
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet historically speaking this came</font>

466
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,660
about because the IETF started looking

467
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,670
at the problem of 911 for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

468
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,540
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take this VoIP system we've</font>

469
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:04,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed this the SIP protocol and make</font>

470
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,490
it possible to do emergency calls with

471
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:09,740
this 911 calls 112 calls and it turns

472
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,209
out that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually pretty easy to do</font>

473
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,579
that once you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have geolocation</font>

474
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:14,839
information and so the question arose

475
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,520
then how do we do geolocation

476
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,619
information in a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's highly</font>

477
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:21,020
reliable it's much more reliable and

478
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:24,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">much more authoritative than the current</font>

479
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:26,900
IP geo regime that we live in today<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

480
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,369
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is you know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should have the</font>

481
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,260
system that's simple to wrap around

482
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:32,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alice existing location resources so</font>

483
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">providers have databases of where things</font>

484
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,629
are we should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

485
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,730
know they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap around that and</font>

486
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:39,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">provide a uniform standard interface to</font>

487
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,140
those things we should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

488
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has you know internet scale</font>

489
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:45,770
properties that we can dynamically

490
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,290
discover which database to query<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an</font>

491
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:49,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">IPA</font>

492
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,940
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should have an explicit</font>

493
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,919
consideration that takes into account

494
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,890
privacy considerations and how users

495
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,240
manage privacy so this has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been going</font>

496
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a few years we're starting to have</font>

497
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,530
some mature technologies coming out of

498
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the basic framework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is you</font>

499
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:09,090
allow both end devices and and third

500
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,310
parties applications to discover<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

501
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,320
right location resources and then have a

502
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:15,750
standard protocol to talk to ask for

503
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,820
that stuff so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the first step is</font>

504
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:20,130
to do this discovery thing so the

505
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:21,750
standard near the ideal way in the ideal

506
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:23,550
case if you're talking DHCP out to your

507
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,890
subscribers you can provide a name to

508
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:28,230
them that says you should go look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

509
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:30,150
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> location server over here and so</font>

510
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">you provide this name example.com and</font>

511
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,590
then the device can go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look and</font>

512
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,360
say AHA that is the URL for my location

513
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:39,120
server and if you're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a</font>

514
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,679
911 app or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something the 911 app can</font>

515
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,419
then go query that location so forget

516
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:44,880
the location and find out who it should

517
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:48,360
be sending its 911 calls to you know

518
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,890
likewise um you know Foursquare can

519
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,560
query the location server and figure out

520
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">where it should be checking in right now</font>

521
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:56,820
so there's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lead</font>

522
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,320
so this is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the gold standard</font>

523
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,929
discovery mechanism<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll mention a</font>

524
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,270
little later other mechanisms for

525
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,400
handing out these URIs because the

526
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,260
overall protocol being an HTTP based

527
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,000
protocol obviously all<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need is a URL</font>

528
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:14,070
to get to it the most obvious thing you

529
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,660
can do is not stick this under some

530
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,970
arbitrary domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> abuts they could under</font>

531
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,730
reverse domain and in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case you know</font>

532
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:22,260
if we start from<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IP address you know</font>

533
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,200
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the IP address of an end</font>

534
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:29,610
device or the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I see as a</font>

535
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,100
source IP address as a as a web service

536
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:34,790
say then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> look in the reverse DNS</font>

537
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,620
tree for these records and find out

538
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:40,320
location server you r is for for remote

539
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:44,040
services so that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we find the</font>

540
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,780
services and once we have those URLs we

541
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:47,610
can we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can talk to them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I</font>

542
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,560
won't<font color="#CCCCCC"> get into this in detail but the</font>

543
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:51,030
idea is that if we're on a device we can

544
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,340
send up these measurements cellular or

545
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,780
Wi-Fi or dhcp information or<font color="#E5E5E5"> dsl</font>

546
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,300
information if we built this into it

547
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,559
some cpe we can get back<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

548
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:01,809
about this the location of this device

549
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:05,080
either in geodetic form with coordinates

550
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:06,639
or in the form of an address and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

551
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,580
know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case we've got the address</font>

552
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:14,110
down to my my<font color="#CCCCCC"> guests office in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cambridge</font>

553
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:16,330
in building five room 123 if we're a

554
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,070
third party if you've got some web web

555
00:20:16,330 --> 00:20:19,389
app asking for location through this

556
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,889
channel right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can send up</font>

557
00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:22,269
identifiers for the device you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

558
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:24,340
we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the device so we can't send</font>

559
00:20:22,269 --> 00:20:25,929
up measurements but we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what device</font>

560
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,289
we're talking to so i can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send an IP</font>

561
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:31,840
address in v4 or v6<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I can say what</font>

562
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:33,369
sport I saw this coming from or if you

563
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,289
know if I'm some telephony enabled

564
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:37,899
service I can even<font color="#E5E5E5"> send up me on msisdn</font>

565
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,279
or and MZ or something and you know

566
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:40,539
likewise the response<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually looks</font>

567
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,340
just the same but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

568
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,658
illustrate here a little bit is that one

569
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,668
nice thing about this being a web

570
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:48,669
service is that you can distinguish

571
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:50,200
who's asking and so as a location<font color="#E5E5E5"> server</font>

572
00:20:48,669 --> 00:20:52,659
I can see is this the device itself

573
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,309
asking me or is this somebody else and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

574
00:20:52,659 --> 00:20:56,919
can make privacy decisions based on that

575
00:20:54,309 --> 00:20:59,499
distinction so when the device itself is

576
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,990
asking I can provide very detailed

577
00:20:59,499 --> 00:21:03,100
information down to the room number

578
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:04,570
whereas here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might provide only the</font>

579
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,980
building I might provide a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

580
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">more uncertainty in that geodetic</font>

581
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,450
location so that's that's the protocol

582
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,769
it's pretty simple so there's also a

583
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,389
privacy framework that goes along with

584
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:14,679
this I won't go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in tremendous</font>

585
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:17,320
detail because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting short on</font>

586
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:19,149
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you can read RFC 60 to 80 which</font>

587
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,399
provides a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> detailed architecture</font>

588
00:21:19,149 --> 00:21:23,768
for how you manage privacy rules around

589
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:25,479
location stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the really</font>

590
00:21:23,769 --> 00:21:27,220
simple shortcut story through all this

591
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,659
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know if you're running a</font>

592
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,940
location service you can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

593
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:32,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">user himself whatever he wants and you</font>

594
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,610
can distinguish that by based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you</font>

595
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:35,320
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what IP address you see your</font>

596
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,049
request from and then you can provide

597
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,580
something that's more general fuzzier to

598
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:41,559
any third parties that ask and you can

599
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:43,990
use that distinction as a very basic

600
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:48,580
thing to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> make some privacy</font>

601
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:49,659
preserving thing decisions and so we've

602
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:51,490
built all these things and<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing</font>

603
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:53,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important to emphasize in</font>

604
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,399
this case is<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that while we've built</font>

605
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,499
the hooks in here ultimately it's going

606
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:58,658
to be up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the location providers</font>

607
00:21:56,499 --> 00:22:00,700
operators and thing and folks that are

608
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:02,320
operating<font color="#CCCCCC"> these location services to</font>

609
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,570
choose how they preserve privacy and

610
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,700
it's an interaction between operators

611
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:09,070
their subscribers and possibly their

612
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,659
regulators so you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> goal of the</font>

613
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,320
technology is to provide the right hooks

614
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:14,850
but ultimately<font color="#CCCCCC"> what gets instantiated is</font>

615
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,730
going to depend on on those three

616
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:19,350
parties so so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology</font>

617
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,320
we've got running around nowadays and

618
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:24,059
what we at the IETF have tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

619
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">together for folks to use to improve</font>

620
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:28,649
things so so where do we stand in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms</font>

621
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:30,389
of deploying this stuff if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

622
00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:32,580
where geo<font color="#CCCCCC"> prep stands right now we have</font>

623
00:22:30,389 --> 00:22:34,379
sort of a chicken<font color="#CCCCCC"> and egg problem you</font>

624
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,570
know the typical new protocol thing

625
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,279
where you know this would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

626
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,299
valuable if we had it but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I'm</font>

627
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,830
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to write code to this</font>

628
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:42,899
interface because nobody's providing the

629
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:43,889
information through that interface and

630
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:45,268
I'm not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide information</font>

631
00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:47,360
through that interface because nobody's

632
00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:50,009
asking for stuff through that interface

633
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,658
so sort of where we stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> now is that</font>

634
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:53,820
there's very clear interest in this you

635
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:56,240
know from an application side we've had

636
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:58,590
some interest in sort of who is based

637
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,860
discovery systems from from google and

638

<font color="#E5E5E5">max mind and cove on mozilla sort of the</font>

application location provider side of

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,649
the world and we they're starting to be

641
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:09,960
some interest interest in the u.s. from

642
00:23:07,649 --> 00:23:13,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">the regulatory side in terms of enabling</font>

644
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:18,750
some better fidelity than asking the

645
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:20,219
user to register their location we do

646
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,950
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some open source implementations</font>

647
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,570
out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think on the next slide so</font>

648
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,980
you asked me for<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about open</font>

649
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,870
source<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forgot to put the oral</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

650
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,639
slides but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are open source</font>

651
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:33,059
implementations of this held protocol

652
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:34,709
and and the discovery<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this you</font>

653
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:36,570
may notice is just about configuring

654
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,490
DHCP and DNS stuff so it's really

655
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,850
configuration thing no no real code is

656
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:44,190
provided on the provisioning side and

657
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:46,049
there's some initial work<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

658
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:48,240
alternative discovery system so you know

659
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,220
we I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> described some DHCP and DNS</font>

660
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,809
based systems you could also in

661
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,600
principle put this stuff in the whois

662
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:57,960
database right<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could put add a line</font>

663
00:23:54,600 --> 00:24:00,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">to who is records and say for location</font>

664
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:03,059
information that my geolocation contact

665
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,860
is this URL so go talk to that URL if

666
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,889
you want location information about my

667
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,809
subscribers and so there's some work

668
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:14,519
being done in ripe that might show up in

669
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:16,320
a piña<font color="#E5E5E5"> caswell and there's I think 10</font>

670
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,210
minutes allocated in the open policy are

671
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,370
in the air<font color="#E5E5E5"> in meeting tomorrow to</font>

672
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">discuss the possibility of doing this in</font>

673
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,799
the whois database in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron region</font>

674
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:27,040
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a picture</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font>

00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:28,389

682
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:45,610
just to wrap up you know how what can we

<font color="#CCCCCC">with this you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start seeing how</font>

you this might be feasible in your

689
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:58,570
work at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet layer at the IETF</font>

690
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:01,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Flair we only sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of know about types</font>

691
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,649
of networks and mostly about packets we

692
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,360
don't know about all the specifics of

693
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:06,010
how networks get put together at the

physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer that you're going to need</font>

695
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,250

696
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:10,930
so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can look around you know go home</font>

697
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:13,480
to your network and say hey what do we

698
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:15,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here that could be fit together to</font>

699
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,170
make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> location service you know we</font>

700
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,180
played around with this at an ietf

701
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:21,880
meeting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little while back and you know</font>

702
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:23,290
said oK we've got SNMP tables that tell

703
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,800
us what mac addresses are assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

704
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,240
which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> PS we've gotten dhcp lease</font>

705
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,649
tables and tell us what IP addresses

706
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,540
have belonged which mac addresses so

707
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:33,460
yeah we could kind of trace through from

708
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,010
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least an IP</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> address to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> location</font>

709
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:37,780
of an AP and get some idea of location

710
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,070
that way so that's sort of you know it's

711
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:40,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of like the information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is hanging</font>

712
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,030
around but it might get need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

713
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,680
piece together and so like I said

714
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:46,180
there's open source code that you can

715
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,370
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> to provide a standard interface to</font>

716
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,010
this and of course the DNS records or

717
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,949
who is records possibly to allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

718
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:56,560
to discover these services is only a

719
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:57,670
record provisioning away and again we're

720
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be discussing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this in the air</font>

721
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,720
and open policy our the possibility of

722
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:02,889
adding the stuff to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the whois database</font>

723
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,270
so I would encourage you<font color="#E5E5E5"> all to come to</font>

724
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:05,290
that and engage in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that discussion if</font>

725
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,930
you're sticking around for the air<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

726
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:09,610
meeting so with that some references if

727
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,780
you want further information and that's

728
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,780
all I have questions

729
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:29,330
ok

730
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:32,210
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sandy Murphy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sparta I had kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

731
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:34,129
a rumination sort of question Jeff

732
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,809
Houston spoke about the possibility of

733
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:39,279
not having an open one internet

734
00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:41,690
everywhere but balkanization would this

735
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,549
architecture which is focused<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

736
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:50,120
applications that need geolocation

737
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:52,158
information work as well in<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where</font>

738
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,059
the networking services need the

739
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,200
geolocation information hmm that's a

740
00:26:56,059 --> 00:26:58,399
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question what I haven't really</font>

741
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about there's already been a</font>

742
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:03,289
little bit of accommodation that's

743
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's sort of starting to be built into</font>

744
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:07,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">the protocol for things like</font>

745
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,529
carrier-grade NAT you noticed in that

746
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,600
third party example had there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a</font>

747
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:13,130
source port yeah so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> say what</font>

748
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,399
port thing you got something from in

749
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:19,159
addition to you know what I what address

750
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:20,989
you saw it from and so there's starting

751
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:24,049
to be some accounting for disambiguation

752
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,460
at that layer in terms of providing us

753
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:26,779
to network services i don't know we

754
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it may be an</font>

755
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,460
interesting question look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks ok</font>

756
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:37,269
Chris Chris wealthy from switch this is

757
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:40,039
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a comment from a user perspective</font>

758
00:27:37,269 --> 00:27:43,909
to the service providers that use

759
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:47,960
geolocation please don't forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as</font>

760
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:53,149
a user I like to be able to change the

761
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:56,330
location so I I don't always<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

762
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:59,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the web</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pages or whatever localized</font>

763
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,918
to my current<font color="#E5E5E5"> location that I am or that</font>

764
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">this reported by geolocation this also</font>

765
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,860
makes it easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to not having to call</font>

766
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:11,809
support<font color="#CCCCCC"> or something when I don't get to</font>

767
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:13,580
see what I'm supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see yeah the</font>

768
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:14,750
one of the other things that I didn't

769
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,189
mention here that's been worked on the

770
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">GRE of working group is the question of</font>

771
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">how you express you create a policy</font>

772
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,129
language for expressing privacy

773
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:24,019
preferences and so it's it's pretty easy

774
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,450
to say don't tell my location to better

775
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:28,909
than a kilometer<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd like one kilometer</font>

776
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,440
accuracy around my location and then

777
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:32,090
there's been some initial proposals for

778
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,429
that sort of full replacement you know

779
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't just fuzz up my real location</font>

780
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:39,000
actually provide something completely

781
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:40,709
different it's sort of sort of one thing

782
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,809
something that's been proposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I</font>

783
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:45,450
don't know how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> along the process is</font>

784
00:28:42,809 --> 00:28:47,850
right now yes Mike<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joseph google</font>

785
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,980
actually to my question sort of relates

786
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,199
to the last one is the the problem with

787
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,450
obtaining the data either from the user

788
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,880
or from an authoritative source rather

789
00:28:54,450 --> 00:29:00,030
than from inference is that you can't

790
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">rely on it as much and in particular one</font>

791
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,139
common use case for location data as you

792
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,390
mentioned earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> is being able to</font>

793
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,000
filter content which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is often either a</font>

794
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,059
regulatory or contractual obligations so

795
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,730
if you have to be able to determine with

796
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:16,049
some degree of accuracy where a user is

797
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,610
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the system like this</font>

798
00:29:16,049 --> 00:29:20,100
and particularly a system where the user

799
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:21,570
could provide input into their location

800
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,178
would be you can no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> rely on it</font>

801
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,399
for that sure so anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're</font>

802
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,370
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with in the protocol or design</font>

803
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,679
well so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of at least these</font>

804
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:34,320
systems is to provide a<font color="#CCCCCC"> channel for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

805
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,850
operator to provide input that doesn't

806
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,530
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whoever is receiving</font>

807
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:39,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that location information that input is</font>

808
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:41,610
going to treat that as the only input so

809
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:43,950
it's it's completely plausible that

810
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:47,189
systems using traceroute studio to

811
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:50,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">apolog-- using Wi-Fi information to to</font>

812
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:52,860
corroborate a location<font color="#CCCCCC"> value I expect</font>

813
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:54,450
those will persist and and the location

814
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:58,350
services like cova and maximum will

815
00:29:54,450 --> 00:30:01,260
persist as people to vet and corroborate

816
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:03,059
the information that providers supply

817
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,500
with regard to geo location because

818
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:07,740
you're right you know there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

819
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,299
incentives for for operators for users

820
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,640
to lie about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to get acting you know</font>

821
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:14,370
if I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Malaysian I want to access you</font>

822
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,110
know right yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that place or what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

823
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:17,820
you even providers may sell it as a

824
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,000
premium<font color="#E5E5E5"> service to give you absolutely</font>

825
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,408
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so there there will be some need to</font>

826
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,890
do anti-fraud on that channel as well

827
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:31,200
yes sir any new clean air and staff do

828
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,620
have a question the right implementation

829
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,720
puts coordinates into the who is correct

830
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,820
in in the demo version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the demo</font>

831
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,730
displays last week so that's supposed to

832
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:47,309
be the coordinates of the network or of

833
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:50,179
the endpoint or so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> assigned on a</font>

834
00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:53,789
network level<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um so it's an</font>

835
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:55,799
approximation presumably of where where

836
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:58,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end users are with the intent of</font>

837
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,789
putting a URL and who is point to a

838
00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:02,240
geolocation server be that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> hand</font>

839
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:04,830
it the IP address vs so you can get

840
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,190
location of what something more

841
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:09,870
meaningful than a network vs<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah so</font>

842
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,840
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can in it I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a P address or maybe a</font>

843
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:15,360
prefix and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a richer</font>

844
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,799
geolocation syntax in that XML you could

845
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:21,178
you know the provider could hand back

846
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,918
something has a postcode or a country

847
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:25,110
designation or even you know some

848
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:35,000
polygons that describes a region all

849
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:35,000
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right thanks a lot</font>
