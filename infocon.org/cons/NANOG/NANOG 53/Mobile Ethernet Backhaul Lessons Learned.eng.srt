00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,910
the challenges and lessons learned I

14
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,339
think this will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting for not</font>

only wireless<font color="#E5E5E5"> providers but also some of</font>

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,030
the wireline providers who are reselling

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:44,879
these services for other wireless

18
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:47,579
technologies so so why you've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,649
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the back hall the number one reason</font>

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,110
obviously customers use lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data and</font>

21
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,270
that just doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> scale on TDM as you</font>

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:59,579
can imagine in terms of technologies

00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:02,579
cost<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet is a commodity very</font>

24
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,159
inexpensive we're able to see a lot of

25
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,520
these feature functionality move

26
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,310
directly into the ran architecture

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,439
instead of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emulate it on top</font>

28
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:17,150
so again it comes down essentially the

<font color="#E5E5E5">cost and growth on the network itself</font>

30
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:24,330
ethernet is everywhere so this is a very

<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> topic that if any of you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned before so what we do</font>

68
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,980
essentially is we replace the middle

that's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> route we took that's not say in</font>

00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,810
the end of the day it's a my opinion a

standardization certification effort

130
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,889

me I can't go to 30 different providers

00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:26,289
AV service and adding what a microwave

145
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,319
might look like this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a very</font>

upon

148
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,270
so again the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> important thing that</font>

149
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:39,849
that we've seen both both proactive and

150
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:41,680
reactive is standardized the best we can

151
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,960
write in a perfect world I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle</font>

152
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,430

153
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,169
say you must meet these requirements at

154
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,650
the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day they do their best</font>

155
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:54,940
and technology business wise maybe they

156
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,900
can so we kind of we do what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can some</font>

157
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,240
of the most important things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

158
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,370
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about basic transport</font>

ordering frame<font color="#CCCCCC"> loss frame delay</font>

160
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,570
variation maximum and average obviously

161
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,430
this is very important depending on the

162
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:09,040
technologies using for 2g emulations

163
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,230

165
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:15,730

168
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,660
is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think</font>

169
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> future you may be deploying</font>

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">frame</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so certainly take into</font>

173
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:35,110
consideration contractually how to meet

174
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,060
those needs forwarding characteristics

175
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,680
so this is you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so</font>

176
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,480
important when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> buying the</font>

177
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,920
traditional eline or point-to-point

178
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,060
services but when you start talking

179
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:50,470
about an eel and oar etree it becomes

180
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:53,230
quite complex and unique how each

181
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:55,480
provider will actually build a cam table

182
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:58,870
a forwarding database it's updating its

183
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:02,410
rules in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of flooding bum filter</font>

184
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,880
stuff like that so it's very important

185
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,500
consideration when you're looking at

186
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,350
these technologies to think about some

187
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it then the last one obviously is a</font>

188
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,130
customer and provider monitoring we're

189
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,200
pretty up front where<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll tell them</font>

190
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:16,210
exactly the granularity the technologies

191
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,940
we're going to be using to monitor their

192
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,250
network and ideally we'd like to see the

193
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:25,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same thing on there and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can</font>

194
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:28,600
have a phone call compare data we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

195
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:30,400
you see why in some worst-case scenarios

196
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,450
I could you know call my provider and

197
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,429
say I'm losing CCM packets or<font color="#CCCCCC"> dmm I've</font>

198
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,080
got a<font color="#CCCCCC"> pvv of you know nine hundred</font>

199
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,809
microseconds or whatever it might be and

200
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,040
they tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> their ping works right so</font>

201
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,349
there's a different levels<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

202
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,689
understanding

203
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:47,690
so make sure you talk up front and set

204
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,390
expectations again that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pay off</font>

205
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:53,010
right away the next is betting the

206
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:56,699
design with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the carrier and obviously</font>

207
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:00,420
documented again with 30-plus different

208
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,380
providers you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that they</font>

209
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,510
would just solve all these problems

210
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,280
underneath the sheets and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

211
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,960
guys do they're quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at saying yes</font>

212
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:10,020
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start to ask the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hard questions</font>

213
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,140
how it actually works you might be very

214
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in the technologies and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

216
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,579
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really happening under</font>

217
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,320
so it's important to partner be

00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,890
transparent<font color="#CCCCCC"> as much as possible both</font>

lasting partnership some of the other

221
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:34,439
ones obviously take into consideration

222
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:36,300
failure convergence and diversity in

223
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,680
design you don't want to buy a thousand

224
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,880
cell sites from a provider that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a</font>

00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,100
alarms and going off when you have some

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of these conversations with folks</font>

stuff like that with ethernet extremely

quick assuming that the physical

257
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,780
comes down to growth scaling 100 few

hundred megabits per second each of

259

these cell sites

260
00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:02,090
consider your domain<font color="#CCCCCC"> sizing so this this</font>

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,710
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is where things may change a little</font>

267
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:21,650
we can also adding on top of that so as

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:24,620
you can imagine we're putting a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

trust in risk the reward obviously is

high data speeds for users it's

271
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,860
transparent but there's a significant

amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk so really again</font>

363
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,719
little bit subjective there when their

364
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,290
IPA

365
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,449
well they're actually getting quite

366
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:31,730
they'd hear well<font color="#E5E5E5"> two events on Ethernet</font>

367
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:33,889
an IP network much better than sat top

368
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,920
or any other pseudowire type

369
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:39,110
technologies so we did choose SAT atop

370
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,939
we're quite happy with it thus far

371
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:44,600
obviously we're still going through<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

372
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:46,790
some girl planes we considered says<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh</font>

373
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,160
PSN our own implementation didn't have

374
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:51,469
some basic AIS bits attached when there

375
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,180
was a cut in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle so again your</font>

376
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,740
mileage may vary but these are things

377
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,050
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> had take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into consideration when it</font>

378
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,269
knocks been watching for t1 alarms on a

00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,189
BTS for the past seven years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

380
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:05,779
take that<font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a pretty big gap</font>

381
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:07,490
so again you know probably the lowest

382
00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:10,040
risk thing is these providers are

383
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,290
offering the the t1 service<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

384
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,759
edge today so the question comes up why

385
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just leave them at the cost</font>

386
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,470
that we pay them a few hundred dollars

387
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:21,019
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> 41 when I've got a hundred</font>

388
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,970

391
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:29,930
technology starts to make some sense

392
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,759
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some risk in terms of</font>

off the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one synchronizations that's</font>

396
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:44,508

the providers underlined networks are

402
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,079
not always the case luckily a lot of our

403
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:06,319
2g infrastructure was built out with a

404
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:08,389
911 service based around triangulation

405
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,280
so it had a local GPs feed were able to

pull sink there locally another option

end intelligence so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

416
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,740
that initially was overlooked at our

deployment of

418
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,679
we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just assume that the provider</font>

highly recommend if you're looking at

00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,289
with things like spanning tree so

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,999
obviously not something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's far from</font>

486
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:27,409
and can cause some real havoc so

487
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:29,479
certainly understand you know ask those

scale it up kick it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really understand</font>

494
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,019
would have at the scale we're talking

495
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,919
about every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> time a user does a</font>

often troublesome quirky implementations

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen it's important that IP</font>

possible to understand how they do some

<font color="#E5E5E5">of this basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> keep-alive mechanism</font>

505
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:19,669
because it's often a lot of room for

506
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:23,590
opportunity another major challenge that

507
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:25,489
we've had is as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> gsm TDM provider is</font>

508
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,649
somebody's got to support this at a

509
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:30,739
grand scale and<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistically i can't</font>

510
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:32,600
have a TDM knock in a data or IP knock

511
00:21:30,739 --> 00:21:34,789
and then a services level or knock right

512
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,658
in order for a company be successful we

513
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:41,210
need to you know train our folks up so

514
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:45,710
we essentially took a couple hundred

515
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:47,899
person TDM nak brought them up to a

516

basic level of understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet at</font>

00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,299

IP don't always mix it take some time

525
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,240
realistically it took us almost a year

526
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get to a point where we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

527
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,510
say we're more comfortable that folks

<font color="#E5E5E5">are taking the phone calls of outages</font>

529
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:22,129
and what they do next and there's ways

530
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:23,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">to mitigate that risk right first of all</font>

531
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:25,400
it's the the training piece but the next

532
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,169
piece is we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to correlate events so</font>

533
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,720
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a thousand cell sites that</font>

539
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:49,210
taking place so it's important<font color="#E5E5E5"> you spend</font>

locally and roll that up to our national

549
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:12,678
obviously you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to solve</font>

the problem as soon as possible 10,000

574
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,290

575
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:16,200
from your AV provider it's going to need

578

00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:25,980
is encapsulated some basic

580
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:28,350
troubleshooting events are paying stuff

like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and ideally integrate oh NM</font>

00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,408
can give you an idea of something may

594
00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,330
have transitioned and then the transport

595

<font color="#CCCCCC">will react to different network</font>

597
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:04,500
characteristics so it's important to

598
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:07,460
monitor and understand it but doesn't

599
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,990
always mean it's an actionable event so

600
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:12,510
monitoring ethernet service obviously in

608
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:30,929
it's it's incredibly important that you

609
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,428
can paint a picture before an event

610
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,169
happens to understand whether things

611
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:36,620

troubleshooting scaling so you have to

think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right you don't</font>

providing IP connectivity we believe the

00:26:20,669 --> 00:26:24,149
most stringent needs are actually based

631
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,279
upon the pseudowire service over the top

that the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> for g5g you you know</font>

skype stuff like that we're already

637
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,190
seeing it with our<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3G when it was</font>

638
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,780
ip-enabled obviously some room for

639
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,600
improvement there but for the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> part</font>

640
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:43,680
it's quite forgiving and can recover on

641
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,419
its own normal best practice make sure

642
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,010
that the design meets a threat three to

643
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,110
five year plan again you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

644
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:51,150
have to fork lift things at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

645
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:53,310
magnitude again because we're talking in

646
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:55,740
the millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of customers per a backhaul</font>

647
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:58,080
last piece is scaling right so if we're

648
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,790
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this 30,000 times we are</font>

649
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,169
going to need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to automate and I think</font>

650
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure a lot of people do this already</font>

651
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:06,090
but if you're not you want an

652
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,800
authoritative database that says how

653
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,600
these services are provided what's

654
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:13,470
unique<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them whether it's a VLAN ID</font>

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cir different p DV delay exceptions</font>

656
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:17,010
etc but it's incredibly important to

657
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,570
make sure you've got a consistent

658
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,120
deployment across and one place to go

659
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:27,149
and understand where these providers are

660
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:29,909
unique so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i apologize i moved a little</font>

661
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,490
bit fast at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end but two minutes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

672
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,450
you're happy with that one question

673
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:06,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">number two for you as you said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2g</font>

services are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going anywhere does it</font>

675
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,490
mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be BAU cap no growth</font>

676
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">and traffic and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute upon</font>

677
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:18,180
the fact that we have certain set of

678
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:21,000
traffic between two runners 2g so yeah

679
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,700
so obviously 2g is not growing we've got

680
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,010
a finite amount of spectrum radio it's

681
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,420
actually you know depending on some of

682
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,980
our strategy in the near future it will

683
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,500
be remind but the end of the day we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

684
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:36,090
a 2g fallback scenario for people a with

685
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:39,510
2g handsets and<font color="#CCCCCC"> be for 3g fall back to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">2g services so when we have to nail up</font>

687
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:43,500
obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> we pseudowire</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SAT up once you</font>

688
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,480
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need these one or two t1s</font>

689
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,010
that bandwidth is already a foregone

690
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:52,110
conclusion so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't see that type of</font>

691
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:54,030
bandwidth need services growing but it

692
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:56,520
also can't diminish until I can sunset

693
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:59,790
my 2g network period so the sunset

694
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:02,070
process is a locum progress quickly we

695
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,870
do see some<font color="#CCCCCC"> D comms happening as well so</font>

696
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,439
does it many<font color="#CCCCCC"> little sun sets at some</font>

697
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:11,159
point again realistically in the the

698
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">five plus i would say honestly time</font>

699
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,650
frame we would need one hundred percent

700

penetration of 3g handsets<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4g handsets</font>

703
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,600
wireless you can look at some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

704
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:32,490
with 33 million subscribers that takes
