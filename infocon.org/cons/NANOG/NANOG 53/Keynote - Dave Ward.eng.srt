00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,620
good morning everyone my name is Dave

2
00:00:03,929 --> 00:00:09,240
Ward I'm usually up here and talking

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,849
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to build routers and what</font>

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,519
what's coming next in router design or

5
00:00:11,849 --> 00:00:16,350
in protocol design but instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> I decided</font>

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:19,109
to take an opportunity today to talk

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,970
about a general trend that's going on in

8
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,039
in networking and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really about</font>

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,900
programmable networking and there's a

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,420
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of shiny objects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that can really</font>

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,459
distract you or potentially even confuse

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:30,859
you when trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand what's</font>

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,700
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the different</font>

14
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:34,020
mechanisms that are available<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

15
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,160
programmable networking and the

16
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's available in the</font>

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,078
network now<font color="#E5E5E5"> following before I get into</font>

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this talk following Kevin's talk being</font>

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,690
the slow vendor up here I also do want

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:47,190
to mention that these large interfaces

21
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,620
are available from vendors and in fact

22
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,050
perhaps operators could could also

23
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,730
increase their uptake of the new

24
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,559
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> but that was basically</font>

25
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:01,108
required I said that after Kevin told me

26
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:03,930
I was too slow<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's jump</font>

27
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,700
into this talk so I the talk is<font color="#CCCCCC"> named</font>

28
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,710
programmable networking is safe for work

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,920
and that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> because there is a</font>

30
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,869
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> large trend as I just mentioned in</font>

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,520
a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different interfaces that</font>

32
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,979
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available for application developers</font>

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,710
to actually fundamentally get

34
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,020
information from your network as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as</font>

35
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,729
program devices on the network to keep

36
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:27,929
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very simple and to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off this</font>

37
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,950
this conversation building up to where I

38
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,040
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get to with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to</font>

39
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,470
technology application developers are

40
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,790
wholly interested in the experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

41
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,310
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their particular</font>

42
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,829
customers this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is obvious whether it's</font>

43
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,780
high definition video or its location

44
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:45,539
based services for social networking or

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,280
whatever the case<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be their goal is</font>

46
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">to get the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> experience possible out</font>

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and clearly as as</font>

48
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,240
network operators your goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

49
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,390
connect everyone to everything and

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,798
everyone to everyone else of course and

51
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,840
but the issue that we fundamentally have

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,340
is that application developers and

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,740
here's the fundamental assumption which

54
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,479
we can which we can discuss a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

55
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,179
later is the fundamental assumption is

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,640
that application developers today don't

57
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,660
have a good understanding of the weather

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,279
report of the net

59
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,290
they don't know where things are located

60
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,700
necessarily they don't know what the

61
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,440
utilization of the network is they don't

62
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,019
know what access<font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> speed might be</font>

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the particular other user</font>

64
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,770
or subscriber whatever the case might be

65
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they want to talk to and so this</font>

66
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,060
fundamental wall between what the

67
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,110
network can give to application

68
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,330
developers and what the application

69
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:37,160
developers need from the internet is

70
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:39,210
what needs to what needs to change the

71
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">next assumption that i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

72
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,530
and this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps one of these</font>

73
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,649
visionary kinoti type things is that the

74
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,470
application developer who actually is

75
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,240
the first to program either devices on

76
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to create specific paths</font>

77
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,020
for the service they want to offer or to

78
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,400
be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

79
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,350
internet like a weather report of

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,020
utilization is going to be the one that

81
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">holds the next lottery ticket and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

82
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean by this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or the next winning lottery</font>

83
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,300
ticket in particular and what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean by</font>

84
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,160
this is that clearly when taking a look

85
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,680
at applications that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available on</font>

86
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,470
the iPhone or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case is folks</font>

87
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,720
are attempting to pick up that<font color="#E5E5E5"> winning</font>

88
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,400
lottery ticket by just pushing more and

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,430
more and more applications out there and

90
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,200
differentiation of these applications is

91
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,220
generally based upon the experience and

92
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,260
information that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be delivered and so</font>

93
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:31,020
leading up to this the goal is really to

94
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,709
describe what is what's coming down the

95
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,650
pike and what's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> different so</font>

96
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,270
applications today when taking a look at

97
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,950
the network are really just guessing

98
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:42,989
they're attempting to divine what's

99
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,230
going on on the network there blindly

100
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:48,300
probing and trying to ferret out this

101
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:51,510
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> by using gaming ping stats</font>

102
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,280
or there's proprietary<font color="#E5E5E5"> codecs or there's</font>

103
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:56,340
control channels for variable bitrate

104
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,989
video or they're using who is type

105
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,730
technology to find which which

106
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,709
autonomous system or which provider has

107
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,750
a particular bit of data that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

108
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:06,360
suing them at one particular period of

109
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,220
time really there's no fundamental

110
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,080
interaction to get this data out of the

111
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:12,180
internet to find either the best

112
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,430
location for content or the best way to

113
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:17,160
deliver<font color="#E5E5E5"> this service I can't tell you</font>

114
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,260
how much it drives me<font color="#CCCCCC"> crazy that for</font>

115
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,330
example proprietary control channels

116
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,520
attempting<font color="#E5E5E5"> to scavenge bandwidth out of</font>

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,650
right and center when in

119
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,138
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has the information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> directly</font>

120
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,460
and if they just asked and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just</font>

121
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:33,669
had the ability to give them some

<font color="#CCCCCC">information the switch in and</font>

123
00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:38,630

application signatures such that

interesting things like application

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,289
based billing or just understanding if

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,929
there's some good behavior or bad

above a particular bandwidth threshold

150
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,289

network so on both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

155
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,909
conversation whether their applications

156
00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:49,669
trying to divine something<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

157
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:50,960

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,250
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very expensive as well as</font>

160
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,909
cumbersome behaviors and trying to

161
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,340
figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out so really what I'm</font>

162
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,900
leading up to is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these four</font>

163
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,090
different actors need to come together

164
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,370
in a coordinated fashion whether it's

165
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:08,989
the application where it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font>

166
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,539
it would like to know i should say the

167
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:12,860
end the end device capabilities

168
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:16,550
proximity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a particular bit of content</font>

169
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,080
etc whether content which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is located</font>

170
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:22,340
somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the network can either be</font>

171
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,020
placed somewhere else or we can find out

172
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,039
where to select it based upon analytics

173
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,139
of the server and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font>

174
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,400
examples of this in a second we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

175
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:30,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">end user who knows what they're looking</font>

176
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,599
for and we have the network which has

177
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,969
fundamental information of understanding

178
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:36,219
where is an end user where is the

179
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:38,680
content

180
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,720
what is the what is the application if

181
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,370
we could interact amongst these four

182
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,710
actors we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably do something</font>

183
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,900
better and there's gonna be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

184
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:48,580
talks about some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the fundamental</font>

185
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,039
technologies over the next couple of

186
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:54,250
days on pulling these together in use

187
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,600
cases that<font color="#CCCCCC"> can arise out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

188
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:57,340
let's move this a little bit forward and

189
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:03,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about why networks and applications</font>

190
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:05,280
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work together so really what I'm</font>

191
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,930
trying to say is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's not just</font>

192
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,630
programming the network it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just an</font>

193
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:12,790
application programming a device with a

194
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,800
specific service profile or programming

195
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:16,660
some VLAN tag there's actual

196
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,240
bi-directional information that's

197
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,430
possible for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network to give to</font>

198
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,960
applications and so when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> described</font>

199
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:29,110
programmable networking it is this

200
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:32,620
two-way communication so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

201
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:35,950
already if the application has the

202
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:38,890
ability to inform the network and the

203
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:41,590
network can give fundamental intrinsic

204
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,349
information back to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> application we</font>

205
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,630
then can begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about how we can</font>

206
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,690
affect in bias traffic steering on the

207
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:50,860
network to either preserve fundamental

208
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,320
bandwidth that's available in the core

209
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,690
or in particular to increase the

210
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:58,479
experience that's available and so

211
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">towards this end what I'm what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like</font>

212
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,780
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> describe is that there's a number of</font>

213
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,370
touch points available in the network

214
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:07,030
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we traditionally hadn't considered</font>

215
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:10,150
to be as programmatic points and these

216
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:12,070
can come from either on<font color="#CCCCCC"> be NGS or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

217

cops packet cable whatever the case

221
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:26,410
might be to program a subscribers

building out to the entire portfolio of

285
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,540
quite a bit of conversation recently

286
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:58,150
about networks being made better by

287
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,990
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> from applications and really</font>

here

289
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:02,260
trying to be described as you do have

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:05,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the ability to optimize bandwidth or</font>

291

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">talk about how they actually work</font>

296
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:22,209
together and what's key to this

297
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:26,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pausing for a second</font>

298
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:27,520
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are a number of very high</font>

299
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,170
level conversations that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

300
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,779
about different programming points of

301
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,329
the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all of them appear</font>

302
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:35,500
potentially to be solving a large number

303
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:37,149
of problems and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they all appear to be</font>

304
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:41,459
solving all problems on the planet

305
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:46,180
whether it's virtualizing data centers

306
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:47,829
whether it's sorry whether it's

307
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,089
virtualizing data centers whether it's

308
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,610
building the service profiles for

309
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:54,160
subscribers whether it's populating

310
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,990
content caches what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting about</font>

311
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,939
all of them is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they all are</font>

312
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,760
independent ways to program the internet

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,310
all attempting to duplicate connectivity

314
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,290
between two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different points they keep</font>

315
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the key to remember when looking at</font>

316
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,760
these different technologies is that we

317
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:12,130
aren't necessarily going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reinvent the</font>

318
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,630
internet and all of the protocols with

319
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,089
any new particular way of program the

320
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:17,980
internet or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> new technology the key</font>

321
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:20,140
is how these technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to</font>

322
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">integrate directly with the internet and</font>

anyone who's been around for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while</font>

325
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,950
understands that if we go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

326
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,110
world where we're again signaling

329
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:39,459
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a huge control state</font>

330
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,470
problem and in fact really what we're

331
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,420
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is find a way to take</font>

332
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,430
advantages of programming specific

333
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:46,810
devices and take advantages of<font color="#E5E5E5"> giving</font>

334
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,000
applications and services information

335
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:54,969
from the network in conjunction with

336
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:56,200
what's deployed so we so really<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

337
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about what's authentic what</font>

338
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,310
already exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this will be some of</font>

339
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,060
the use cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring up</font>

340
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:07,510
in just a second so the technology

341
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:09,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's really emerging is is multifold</font>

342
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:11,829
and I'll and I'll bring it into a

343
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:14,140
layered perspective in just a second so

344
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:15,670
again today what we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convert</font>

345
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,350
from is where we're intuitive

346
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,079
information from the network on

347
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:22,329
application side or from the networking

348
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,550
point of view again we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> geo</font>

349
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:27,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">coordinates proprietary control</font>

350
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:31,359
protocols the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> is using DPI's net</font>

351
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:32,410
flows IP data records and then we're

352
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,930
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to a point where we're</font>

353
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,640
communicating this information now the

354
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,410
challenge of trying to do this is that

355
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,850
there's a zillion different stacks out

356
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:41,620
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> which are again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a lot of</font>

357
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:45,160
conversational highlights in the trade

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:47,589
rags cloud stacks openstax whatever the

359
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,270
case might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> open flows which Rob</font>

360
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:52,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">sherwood will talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about over the next</font>

361
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:54,310
couple of days but also there's been a

362
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,589
trend and it may not have been visible

363
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand that there was actual some</font>

364
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:59,829
architectural thought behind this but

365
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:01,839
there's been a trend over the last 10

366
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:03,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">years for communicating this information</font>

367
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:07,199
within the protocols that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

368
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:10,839
have designed such that we can extend

369
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,870
api's and extend information that's

370
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,060
being transmitted via these protocols in

371
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:20,050
a variety of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different categories so</font>

372
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:21,790
first is path computation element brief

373
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:24,370
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of history path computation element</font>

374
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:26,589
was originally<font color="#E5E5E5"> built or constructed for</font>

375
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,320
inter autonomous system traffic

376
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:30,579
engineering and and path set up that

377
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">sounds fine we didn't we didn't really</font>

378
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:35,739
have a very easy ways of doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

379
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:38,920
what's interesting is that once you have

380
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:41,410
a server that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can program to that</font>

381
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,779
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> communicate with routers to set up</font>

382
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:47,500
paths between endpoints we have

383
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:49,300
reinvented soft<font color="#CCCCCC"> pvcs and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring this up</font>

384
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,220
because I have a long career of

385
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:53,260
reinventing things many many times and

386
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:56,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">in fact what I want to highlight it in</font>

387
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,180
all of these cases is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that by reusing</font>

388
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,990
technology that we know and understand

389
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:03,339
very very well we can use these two

390
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,810
obviously benefit not only application

391
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">developers and the services on the</font>

392
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,500
internet but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quality of experience</font>

393
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:10,420
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet itself so we'll start</font>

394
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">with path computation element and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

395
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">build these up in a couple slides the</font>

396
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,640
next is Jeanette and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might say well</font>

397
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:16,270
what the hell is Jennifer I haven't even

398
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,840
heard of this thing

399
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:23,250
so what generic application extensions

400
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,840
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SR is the ability to pass</font>

401
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,180
application information or application

402
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,220
server information within and within

403
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,859
interior gateway protocol like<font color="#E5E5E5"> is is or</font>

404
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,420
ospf now you say<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh for the love of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font>

405
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:35,950
the last thing we need to do is overload

406
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,469
these routing protocols with more crap

407
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:40,870
and thanks Dave for reinventing that one

408
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,150
well there's good<font color="#CCCCCC"> news I didn't</font>

409
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:44,970
necessarily invent it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to overt or it</font>

410
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,870
wasn't invented to necessarily be

411
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:49,270
transmitted directly with the routing

412
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:51,910
information we learned some lessons and

413
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:53,860
we realize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cases we need to</font>

414
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:56,050
disseminate information via via flooding

415
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,060
protocol ospf and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias are very good</font>

416
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">at disseminating information but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

417
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,050
don't want this to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be passed with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

418
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,640
routing information we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want</font>

419
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:05,410
routing to converge faster than we

420
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:07,930
necessarily want application data to be

421
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,620
sent so there's been over the number of

422
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:13,180
years there's been inventions of

423
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">multi-instance of these interior gateway</font>

424
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,530
protocols and now there's the ability to

425
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,380
pass generic application information so

426
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:22,689
now if you wanted to for example say

427
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,550
that you have an at a firewall or some

428
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:27,360
kind or a dpi service at a particular

429
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:31,810
location you can pass<font color="#CCCCCC"> this without</font>

430
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,280
fundamentally decreasing router sorry

431
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,959
for a fundamental increasing router

432
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">convergence or decreasing performance on</font>

433
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">the Internet moving through some of</font>

434
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,180
these others that will talk about and

435
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,980
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more detail</font>

which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alto the application layer</font>

437
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,260
traffic optimization protocol will hold

438
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">s for a second but really the point is</font>

439
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,520
that over the last couple of years folks

440
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,160
have been trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build protocols that</font>

441
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:57,370
we can begin to signal and and

442
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,160
communicate the best location via

443
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:02,440
proximity of a user or application to

444
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that particular service and then the</font>

445
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,120
last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one which is just recently emerging</font>

446
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:09,010
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP with traffic engineering</font>

447
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,810
extensions and once again I recommend

448
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,640
you to remain calm when I<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

449
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">putting more information into BGP</font>

450
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,470
because that generally gets people upset

451
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,650
again we have realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

452
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:23,170
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass information in BGP</font>

453
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:25,870
without using the same peering session

454
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:28,570
that's passing routing information bgp

455
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,770
can also be multi-instance now also the

456
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">next thing that generally gets people</font>

457
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,480
upset

458
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,190
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about traffic engineering</font>

459
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,050
and bgp and they say for the love of<font color="#CCCCCC"> God</font>

460
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,390
we don't need to be able to signal

traffic<font color="#CCCCCC"> engineered pass with BGP well</font>

462
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:43,630
that's not what this is about this is

463
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,420
merely about passing interior gateway to

464
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:50,140
apology information and traffic in

465

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">I say this because again if you step</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">general we've spent a lot of time</font>

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,860

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,530
these arguments are a complete waste<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

all of our time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I say they're</font>

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,370
thing and again stepping back most

487
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:46,360
networks are built out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a control or</font>

495
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,620
introducing the subject is that we're

496
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,860
putting yet more information in BGP and

497
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,199
again hold your coffee really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

498
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:14,800
situation when we put in CDN information

499
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,140
to bgp and this can be both the users

500

that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to be reached in a</font>

501
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,710

00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">geographic very specifically in this</font>

503

these are new extensions that you're

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see rise so tying this all back</font>

508
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,870
to what we want to be able to do with

509

programmable networks we have

across the network the key is how to do

this without breaking the system and I

522
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,080
know I asked you to hold your coffee

523
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,270
several times already this morning but

524
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,250
really my story that I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to tell</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> today is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do this</font>

without breaking the entire internet and

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,980
causing our routing peering sessions to

<font color="#CCCCCC">about the fragility of our particular</font>

536
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,150
come from fundamental constructs of

what's available in routing protocols as

538
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:43,780
well as fundamental constructs of

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:47,860
programmatic interfaces that currently

540
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,480
exist in to these perimeter points so I

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,770
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> alluded to the fact that one of</font>

of the router this has basically been

done ubiquitously across all vendors

560
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,739
this is frequently you can get confused

to think that an application developer

api's that are on the router themselves

564

and that isn't the<font color="#E5E5E5"> story that I want to</font>

565
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,390
tell because most application developers

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,060
and think about the folks are out there

differently

00:22:47,709 --> 00:22:51,149

they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see the weather report</font>

600
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,249

00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:07,178
towards this end again we've talked

604
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:09,759
about proximity information we've talked

605
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:12,219
about taking te information just a quick

608
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,519
a shock but we've reached the point

609
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:19,929
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're where there are new</font>

610
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:23,769
attributes are going to be passed that

611
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:25,929
include things like delay now I've been

612
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:27,609
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a little bit and I understand</font>

613
00:23:25,929 --> 00:23:29,320
the issues of doing delay based routing

614
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:31,599
with respect to what happened in ARPANET

615
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:37,059
many many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago but the mere fact</font>

616
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:39,849
that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not passing delay constant</font>

617
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,589
associated with our paths not

00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:47,919
we aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it at all in our</font>

621
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,179
calculations the time has come where we

622
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,609
need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this again</font>

623
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:55,320
and these variables need to come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

624
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:57,879
delay variants loss on a path

625
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,168
utilization on a path these are things

626
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:01,629
that have been a long time coming I

627
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:03,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's been over 20 years or</font>

628
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:05,349
even over 25 years since the last time

629
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:07,539
that their attempts to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to lay based</font>

630
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:09,489

631
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:11,350
not need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the same approach and</font>

632
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:14,260
technique that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was taken 25 years ago</font>

633
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:16,539
we do need these variables available to

634
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,669
us as network operators as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

635
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:20,320
application developers to increase or

636
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:23,260
improve the experience on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

637
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,539
so this real-time topological firm ation

638
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,330
and real-time weather report information

639
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:31,000
is now fundamentally available coming

640
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:32,649
out of the out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

641
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,090
let's make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure the farmville guys are</font>

642
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,100
recording this stuff up those frat boys

643
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:38,110
are only coding to the orchestration

644
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,570
platform and not touching the the

645
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:43,059
routers themselves we've already talked

646
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:45,309
about steering traffic and building soft

649
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:52,178
open flow in a little bit but in some

650
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:54,850
just quickly open flow is the technology

651
00:24:52,179 --> 00:24:57,730
in which and it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only technology in</font>

652
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,820
which you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to program</font>

653
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,620
with high-performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time</font>

654
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,299
ephemeral classifiers that are not held

655
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,399
in the router's configuration file

656
00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:07,629
they're coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from application space in</font>

657
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,120
being jammed directly into the

658
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:12,850
forwarding plane so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of</font>

659
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">this as a traffic selection mechanism a</font>

660
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,620
program programmatic traffic selection

661
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:19,210
mechanism it's a current shiny object

662
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,489
that's being discussed quite a bit but

663
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,350
at the same point it has high utility

664
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,440
for a particular bit of functionality

665
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,939
that isn't otherwise available and I've

666
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,710
already reached on these on these new

667
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:34,059
touch points so let me build up just a

668
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,559
little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> on these protocols</font>

669
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:38,350
and really what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

670
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:42,220
accomplish with them so when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

671
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:43,658
about what we want Alto for and it's

672
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:46,330
again application layer traffic

673
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:48,610
optimization from an application space

674
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:51,189
what you're asking the network is where

675
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:55,479
is it located on the internet and how

676
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,950
far is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> from me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're going to</font>

677
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,179
see I'll walk you through an example is

678
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,500
just a second that's what we're

679
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:02,770
fundamentally trying to accomplish from

680
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,390
application space the next piece with

681
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:06,668
respect to path computation and path

682
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:09,100
computation element building soft<font color="#CCCCCC"> bbc's</font>

683
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:10,690
is basically how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from where I</font>

684
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,730
am<font color="#E5E5E5"> to where it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and how can i</font>

685
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,440
dynamically program and using the

686
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,700
current signaling control and signaling

687

mechanisms on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet to get me</font>

688
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:20,409
there we've got policy enforcement and

689
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:22,658
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned open flow is excellent</font>

690
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:24,340
program in these classifiers and there's

691
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:26,620
other mechanisms as well

692
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,870
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last one is just service</font>

693
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,549
location which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically object based</font>

694
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:34,449
routing and this is part of bgp CDN work

695
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:37,210
these are the fundamental building

696
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">blocks where is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is it on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

703
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:52,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">is really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what's underneath it all in</font>

704
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:56,320
understanding<font color="#E5E5E5"> how these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different pieces</font>

705
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:58,240
come together now what the application

706
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,010
developer is going to see are these

707
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,679
orchestration and development platforms

708
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:05,140
and I've segmented into these four

709
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:08,950
different pieces traditional IT which is

710
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:10,960
OSS BSS stuff and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know again there's</font>

711
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:12,700
a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform</font>

device subscriber management and there's

713
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,960
entire industries and have been for

714
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,899
decades and trying to build up<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

again sorry turning this into billing

717
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,240
information there's network function

718
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,980
specific pieces and this is where

719
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,289
there's lots and lots of shiny objects

734
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:02,949
related to more related<font color="#CCCCCC"> to social</font>

735
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,260
networking and location ID information

736
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:07,240
and what you can do with location

737
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,950
information when building up a

738
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,630
particular service whether it's social

739
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,890
media whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cases and we'll get</font>

740
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that in a second and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then the last</font>

741
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:17,020
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a provider based development</font>

742
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:19,840
platform so looking at these<font color="#CCCCCC"> four OSS</font>

743
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,789
BSS network functions service functions

744
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,470
and provider based platforms are the

745
00:28:21,789 --> 00:28:26,559
main categories that are used in my use

746
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:28,990
cases so these provider based platforms

747
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,960
what becomes very<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting about</font>

748
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:35,740
these and being from California on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

749
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,790
peninsula south of San Francisco these

750
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:39,340
are

751
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:41,560
several of the operators that currently

752
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:44,439
have application<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> centers</font>

753
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,510
being built or currently working on the

754
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,530
peninsula themselves now what's

755
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,650
interesting about this and the reason

756
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:52,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">why these large telcos and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> msos are</font>

757
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:55,030
doing this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> obvious they want</font>

758
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,740
to capture<font color="#CCCCCC"> some of this itunes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in an</font>

759
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,780
application frenzy that's out there it

760
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">appears to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be just giant you know bag</font>

761
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,780
full of cash that are available there

762
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,100
are and that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a</font>

763
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,129
perfectly fine reason to go after the

764
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,129
business but what I've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build up</font>

765
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:10,930
into this<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation is that these</font>

766
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:12,730
telcos and<font color="#CCCCCC"> MSOs and every Network</font>

767
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:14,470
actually has information that will

768
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,170
fundamentally make these applications

769
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:21,220
better than a simple over-the-top based

770
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:23,410
service and if farmville switch it sorry

771
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">if the folks code into farmville switch</font>

772
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:27,790
from coding say a facebook platform and

773
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,830
this is nothing against facebook<font color="#CCCCCC"> so some</font>

774
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:31,899
remain calm again and switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> over to</font>

775
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,740
these development platforms the point

776
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,990
I'm trying to make is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

777
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,030
automatically reach half of the world's

778
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:40,120
population and<font color="#E5E5E5"> two-thirds of the world's</font>

779
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,590
gdp there is a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of potential</font>

780
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,610
here for programmatic networks and

781
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:44,379
there's a whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of potential for</font>

782
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">these applications to really hit it big</font>

783
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,210
if they can<font color="#CCCCCC"> provide a better service</font>

784
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:51,310
than was done<font color="#E5E5E5"> just straight over the top</font>

785
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:56,050
competing in an aggressive scavenging

786
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:57,520
mechanism as is otherwise done so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

787
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,570
give you a couple of examples and we'll

788
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">walk through some of these use cases</font>

789
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:02,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">there they're pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward</font>

790
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,480
meaning<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I think we've heard heard</font>

791
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,460
about them quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit whether it's</font>

792
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,110
content and service routing whether it's

793
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:11,710
locating the best content or populating

794
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:14,219
caches<font color="#E5E5E5"> MapReduce stuff which is done to</font>

795
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:16,810
a great scale by the search<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies</font>

796
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,840
network operations whether it's vm

797
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:24,010
mobility storage<font color="#CCCCCC"> i/o etc cloud bursting</font>

798
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:27,040
so let's walk through a few of these but

799
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:29,230
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> we hit these direct examples</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

800
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,120
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tie together this technology</font>

801
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,280
such that you can understand how it's

802
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,689
being used in these use cases and tying

803
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,280
together this technology is a

804
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:42,040
combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a few of these</font>

805
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:44,139
programmatic techniques so what I'm

806
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to describe is that if I know</font>

807
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,640
that Dave and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to communicate in</font>

808
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,990
Amman California and he's in Oregon<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

809
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,620
we want to build a specific

810
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,809
communication

811
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,760

812
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,710
Oregon and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a particular</font>

813
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,150
path to get there and let's say I me to

814
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:59,620
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic engineering but what's</font>

815
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,840
interesting of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that once I</font>

816
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,699
built that traffic engineering path any

817
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,559
of my data or any of the data around me

818
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:09,010
could potentially use that path to get

819
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:11,559
to Dave but if I am program classifiers

820
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:13,510
in front of that such that my specific

821
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:15,070
service or my specific my specific

822
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,140
service that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work out with</font>

823
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:18,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Dave is all that will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Traverse this</font>

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,969
certain amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> bandwidth we now have</font>

826
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,300
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of having a traffic engineer</font>

827
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:27,520
path coined as a service engineered path

828
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:29,050
and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what this comes down to is my</font>

829
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,929
application that's building the service

830
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:33,730
can set up the soft PVC or set up the

831
00:31:31,929 --> 00:31:36,760
path between Dave and I can program the

832
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,440
specific admit deny criteria and my

833
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,090
service has a certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reserve</font>

834
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,400
band with a certain experience that I'm

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between Dave and myself so</font>

836
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,490
by building<font color="#E5E5E5"> up a couple of these common</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">building blocks or using a couple these</font>

839
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:53,470
easily create something new and better

840
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:56,169
than what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had in the past so towards</font>

841
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:59,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">this end one example is what can you do</font>

842
00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:01,990
with this technology you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can basically</font>

843
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:04,870
attempt to build pools of service

844
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,880
applications or service appliances now

845
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:09,129
today taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look at edge routers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

846
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,559
say the average somewhere between 13 and

847
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:13,360
20 different service appliances are

848
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,970
currently surround subscriber

849
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,699
terminating edge routers these are

850
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,470
physically bound via orange or yellow

851
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,570
cables directly to that single edge

852
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:25,330
router what's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that they</font>

853
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:29,200
cannot be used easily or cannot be used

854
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:31,240
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> all by other edge routers so what</font>

855
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,250
this technology can do again when you

856
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:35,710
classify specific traffic and have the

857
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to do service backhaul if you</font>

858
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,490
want to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it that way is you can</font>

859
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:41,050
now take these service appliances and

860
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,120
pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> them together in a data center or</font>

861
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:45,520
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pop and have them just be seen as</font>

862
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,129
increments of bandwidth scale or

863
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:49,570
performance so that now they now these

864
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:51,730
service implyin<font color="#CCCCCC"> TSA's can be shared</font>

865
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:53,889
amongst multiple edge routers and these

866
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,350
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> distributed or they clearly can</font>

867
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:57,220
be pooled all the way back into

868
00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">centralized data center there's no</font>

869
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:02,200
topological and it fits directly into

870
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:03,939
that analogy of doing service backhaul

871
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,360
because again you've classified only

872
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font>

873
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,809
at traffic again it doesn't have to be

874
00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:10,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">all of Dave's traffic it could just be</font>

875
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:12,129
his port 80 traffic that's back called

876
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:13,750
to a scrubber to understand why he's out

877
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:17,380
of bounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> on his band with threshold or</font>

878
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:19,960
whatever your example might be this also

00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:40,150
can dynamically build the profiles and

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,090
modify the traffic or flows that are

build a network server load congestion

you can get the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to deliver</font>

00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:06,100
shortest path to get there we'll add in

922
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,859
a little bit on network utilization as

923
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,839
well in combination because the service

into the best answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so you're going</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to get per site whether your network</font>

sorry new york london or paris / site

based upon your view of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network and</font>

939
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,609
where you're located the best media

00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:48,790
server to go to and in this particular

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,470
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York is supposed to go to</font>

Chicago now being from Minneapolis

943
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:55,089
Chicago is rarely the right answer but

944
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:58,900
in this example it is now somebody's

00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:01,720
listening good<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so so towards this</font>

946
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:04,650

947
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:08,259
basically show that media servers can

948
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:10,480
use thresholds like load and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

949
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:13,000
connections to divert traffic in real

950
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,790
time and really what that means is that

951
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Alto will direct the traffic the best</font>

952

server will override with<font color="#CCCCCC"> respect to how</font>

the how the load is on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media server</font>

the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> example which is again</font>

957
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,740
relatively straightforward in particular

00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,990
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular if you have a video</font>

959
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,299
service and you need to either deliver

00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:39,399
that content to cash's or distribute

961
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,140
data or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other easy case to</font>

962
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,000
understand as a data center back up when

963
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:45,190
you have to move<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 terabytes of data</font>

964
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,560
long<font color="#E5E5E5"> distance over the land and you have</font>

965
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:50,230
a necessarily constrained when bandwidth

966
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,180
where you can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> ness place 10 terabytes</font>

967
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,930
at any time<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day or anything at</font>

968
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:57,240
any particular location you want to

969
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:59,830
calendar that bandwidth onto the network

970
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:01,990
based upon priority so again service

971
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:04,090
placement data center back up and cloud

972
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,339
orchestration so the first thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

973
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,360
to do is schedule and reserve that path

974
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,060
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this</font>

975
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,830
orchestration layer and we can

976
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,029
demonstrate<font color="#E5E5E5"> that yeah you can submit</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to push all of the network state up</font>

work with other multiple nms EMS systems

the pieces<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are available which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

that what's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> real-time topology</font>

these two points we want to be able to

set up this path again only between

mechanism and the application<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

see any of that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just say I</font>

you can control how that bandwidth is

1048
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:55,760
really what it is is how to extend an l2

for Rob the last example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to give</font>

i call it today's wheel of misfortune

1055
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,740
because in social networking and

1056
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:18,290
location ID which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a massive topic</font>

the location sorry all the services you

1059

<font color="#CCCCCC">can do on location ID information and</font>

1060
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,500
what's interesting is that there's a

1061
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,790
number of categories that end up trying

fundamentally by us how they're going to

1100

coming out of the network then there's

1101
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:51,049
absolutely no way that you will give

1102
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:53,900
them the ability to affect their

1103
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:56,000

<font color="#CCCCCC">to control what that applications doing</font>

1106
00:41:58,369 --> 00:42:05,050
interesting is that

1107
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:07,129
is that the three fundamental

1108
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:08,840
architectures that are being used<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1109
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,270
location-based services which is either

1110
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:13,430
you're above<font color="#CCCCCC"> the topology like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looped</font>

1111
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,650
or four square type service or you're

1112
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,000
visualizing the topology like navteq or

1113
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:18,680
you're below the topology and trying to

1114
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,130
build location-based services into an

1115
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:25,430
operating system like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Android or iOS</font>

1116
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:28,550
these these are relatively simplistic

1117
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:31,370
and very very basic understandings of

1118
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:33,560
the topology all you have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to</font>

1119
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:35,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">do is say I'm here and you can do this</font>

1120
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,770
through active broadcast and an active

1121
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,630
broadcast of where you are is by

1122
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:40,580
checking in and yeah it's kind of fun to

1123
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,790
know who's in a restaurant but again

1124
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:46,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">these coordinates these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> GSM coordinates</font>

1125
00:42:43,790 --> 00:42:47,480
give you information of how to drive to

1126
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,920
your buddy who's in the nearby

1127

restaurant it doesn't give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

1128
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,180
information about the quality of service

1129
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,069
or experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could have with</font>

1130
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:56,660
them I don't I don't fundamentally

1131
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:58,340
understand why navigational coordinates

1132
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,100
are a fundamental interest to

1133
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:03,560
location-based ID accept the fact it's

1134
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,680
the only information about the topology

1135
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:08,740
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that an operating system on a</font>

1136
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,060
mobile phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually has access to and</font>

1137
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:13,700
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we increase the information that</font>

1138
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:15,590
that operating system had then I would I

1139
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we could build a much much</font>

1140
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:20,810
more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and rich service</font>

1141
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:22,670
delivery experience so towards<font color="#E5E5E5"> that end</font>

1142
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,380
the information that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> bread and butter</font>

1143
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,470
that exists in the network today that's

1144
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:29,510
possible to be given out is you're here

1145
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:30,980
you have this access technology you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1146
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:32,750
this capability the network<font color="#E5E5E5"> has this</font>

1147
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,150
utilization associated with it and

1148
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:37,700
here's that service profile and these

1149
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the things around you its content</font>

resources places people and their

1151
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,790
capabilities as well and so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1152
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,680
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can get beyond the basic</font>

that can be garnered also what's

1169
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,930
important is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a critical</font>

over-the-top issues that may exist with

1175
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:38,240
respect to bandwidth scavenging on the

1176
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,730
network this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of those techniques</font>

1177
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,319
which is to realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> network can</font>

1178
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:44,240
give out information that an application

1181
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:51,140
can control can program the network to

1182
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:53,390
deliver a higher quality service so

1183
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,799
towards that end<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll finish at this</font>

1184
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,960
point with just a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes left if</font>

1185
00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:59,109
there's any questions but thank you very

00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,109
much

1187
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:20,559
any questions any questions about 100

<font color="#CCCCCC">Gig interfaces there you go I'll repeat</font>

00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:27,160
if that helps hello go ahead you're a

1190
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,960
Valencians Georgia Tech I thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very</font>

1191
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,180
talk very interesting I<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a question</font>

1192
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,250
so you you covered a lot of technology

1193
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:35,290
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> could you comment more on money</font>

1194
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:38,800
flows you know who would pay home and

1195
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:41,170
you know let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> Zynga or or farmville</font>

1196
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,420
would they pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this and when they</font>

1197
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:47,829
have a choice of just scavenging the

1198
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:49,480
band so money flows realise I'm I'm a

1199
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:53,530
vendor so I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a perspective</font>

1200
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:57,579
on which way the money flows but kidding

1201
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:59,050
aside so I would imagine<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Zynga</font>

1202
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:00,280
would be wanting to get into

1203
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,750
collaboration and this is my fundamental

1204
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,150
assumption that Zynga would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1205
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:05,980
into collaboration with networking sorry

1206
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:07,630
network operators or autonomous system

1207
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,579
service providers that are willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1208
00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">play this game if they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can deliver</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1209
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:14,319
better service over a particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

1210
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:16,260
then they would be interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

1211
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,279
money flow in that direction and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1212
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,690
users are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a better</font>

1213
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience over one particular network</font>

1214
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:22,750
or another money generally would follow

1215
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,030
that as well that's the fundamental

1216
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:30,040
assumption again I am NOT economist I

1217
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:33,040
just play one at this podium I Patrick

1218
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,540
Gilmore from akamai technologies so 100

1219
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">gig interfaces when are they going to be</font>

1220
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:41,589
less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by 10 gig interfaces less</font>

1221
00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:43,359
money less money because from a network

1222
00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:44,680
operator standpoint the difference

1223
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,440
between a hundred gig interface and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10</font>

1224
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,669
10 gig interfaces is a wiring problem

1225
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:52,180
unless it costs too much money<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

1226
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:53,200
so you want us to use hundred gig why

1227
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:54,759
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it worth our while if you</font>

1228
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,589
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> selling 10 gigs at 12 times agee</font>

1229
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:57,579
how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people would be using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1230
00:46:56,589 --> 00:46:59,920
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people would have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

1231
00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:00,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">them in the past so I think we're going</font>

1232
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,829
to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very nice weather in</font>

1233
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,559
Philadelphia this week it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be an</font>

1234
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:06,819
80s or so so I so the pricing question

1235
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,730
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from an engineering</font>

1236
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:11,859
perspective so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I can I can help</font>

1237
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,910
going back to the most excellent talk

1238
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:14,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually thank you very much it was</font>

1239
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">useful and packed with information which</font>

1240
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:18,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font>

1241
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:21,560
not always common so thank you for that

1242
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:22,910
but when I read when I'm watching this

1243
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,589
while I'm thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> this could be really</font>

1244
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:27,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">good a few things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously pop out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1245
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:29,150
first is this very clearly range

1246
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:32,300
gigantic alarm bells<font color="#E5E5E5"> about things like</font>

1247
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:33,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">network neutrality and you the answer to</font>

1248
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">your last question actually even</font>

1249
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:38,089
highlighted that so you're going to have

1250
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:40,400
services that can pay for better serve

1251
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:42,230
it better performance or you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1252
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,330
have network operators who also happen

1253
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:47,030
to be I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for instance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> MSOs or</font>

1254
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:48,830
say telcos that run<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own cable TV</font>

1255
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:51,349
service and they're streaming for

1256
00:47:48,830 --> 00:47:53,480
instance could be prioritized over

1257
00:47:51,349 --> 00:47:55,150
somebody else's streaming you know what

1258
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,550
happens when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Netflix is competing with</font>

1259
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:00,230
18 t u-verse and one of them is picked

1260
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,670
in this path you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a decision matrix</font>

1261
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,800
there that is opaque to anybody outside

1262
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,349
of the network and then the network

1263
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:07,820
itself is deciding whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're know</font>

1264
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,290
their information is prioritized I

1265
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:13,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">realize that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we already have that</font>

1266
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem today but this as they say pumps</font>

1267
00:48:13,339 --> 00:48:19,670
it up a notch so wondering just how<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

1268
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:23,089
are you going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to ads the</font>

1269
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:25,400
vendor here running the server in the

1270
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:26,930
middle how far you going to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1271
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,180
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> information public that the network</font>

1272
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:31,759
is going to feel maybe not public but

1273
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,868
transparent to the users of it that the

1274
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,980
network's not going to feel is giving

1275
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:35,780
too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> information about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their own</font>

1276
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,609
infrastructure oh that's a very good

1277
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,099
question so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's actually loaded with a</font>

1278
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:44,480
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of carefully laid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> landmines</font>

1279
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:45,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">there so so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> uh so with respect to what</font>

1280
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,410
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done this technology I think</font>

1281
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:50,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">first and foremost if we want to help</font>

1282
00:48:48,410 --> 00:48:52,430
address let's say seven some of Kevin's

1283
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,020
issues that he talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier with</font>

1284
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:56,210
respect to not a band with growing on

1285
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:58,070
his network<font color="#CCCCCC"> if let's say he's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1286
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:00,230
deploy caches it generally seems to be

1287
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:02,480
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks do and now there's</font>

1288
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:03,980
content available in a particular cache

1289
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,080
in a particular area that isn't the one

1290
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:09,380
that you're reaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> at if he had the</font>

1291
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,848
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to apply policy of where</font>

1292
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:12,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">requests for content is going to go in</font>

1293
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:13,490
particular cache and it other goes to

1294
00:49:12,109 --> 00:49:16,279
the closest one or then it goes to the

1295
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:18,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">one that's that meets the SLA meaning</font>

1296
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,880
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not overly loaded etc</font>

1297
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:22,098
these are some fundamental ways that

1298
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:23,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that can be moved forward I'm completely</font>

1299
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:25,339
sidestepping the net neutrality

1300
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,560
conversation as you might notice but

1301
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:29,450
really my point is is that we can start

1302
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:32,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier without jumping directly</font>

1303
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:33,710
into an FCC legal situation by actually

1304
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:37,099
improving the network without stepping

1305
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:39,740
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that line landmine or is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loot</font>

1306
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:41,180
possibility that specific services can

1307
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:43,250
be built with higher quality than others

1308
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:45,200
and it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be biased absolutely that can</font>

1309
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,910
be done today this is these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1310
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,009
more flexible tools to be able to do

1311
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:50,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">that as well for services that are being</font>

1312
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:52,099
provided by a particular provider at

1313
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:54,109
this point i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not going to skirt</font>

1314
00:49:52,099 --> 00:49:55,339
the issue of net neutrality but there's

1315
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">not much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can say about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it at this</font>

1316
00:49:55,339 --> 00:50:03,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular point given FCC's position</font>

1317
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:06,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">mmm pretty good answer Thanks hi Jeff</font>

1318
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:08,630
Sachs from Blue Ridge internet works you

1319
00:50:06,109 --> 00:50:12,290
said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this slide nearly at the</font>

1320
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:15,589
end you showed that network operators

1321
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:17,180
could sorry network operators could

1322
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:20,420
provide all this wonderful information

1323
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:25,029
to the application platforms and to the

1324
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:27,050
local maybe iPhones or whatever and

1325
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:28,730
including great deal of information

1326
00:50:27,050 --> 00:50:30,140
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what bandwidth was available and</font>

1327
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,970
what caches were available and that

1328
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:33,920
seems like very valuable information why

1329
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:35,149
do you think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network operators</font>

1330
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:37,780
would actually be willing to provide

1331
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:41,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to the to the farmville developer</font>

1332
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:46,030
and also there there were some things on

1333
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:49,819
the side as to which other<font color="#CCCCCC"> people and</font>

1334
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:51,410
and you know objects we're also nearby

1335
00:50:49,819 --> 00:50:57,339
and why do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think those people would</font>

1336
00:50:51,410 --> 00:51:01,490
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to provide their their</font>

1337
00:50:57,339 --> 00:51:02,960
locality to to the application so if you

1338
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:05,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about it this way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me go</font>

1339
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,040
from your second point backwards so if

1340
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:08,960
I'm already checking in at a particular

1341
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:10,220
restaurant I've already given out the

1342
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">information of where I'm located in</font>

1343
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,009
topology what we're adding on top of

1344
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:17,599
that or could add on top of that is

1345
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:20,030
utilization of that path am i able to

1346
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:21,680
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> you real-time video from you know</font>

1352
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:34,879
blocky type of transmission so the goal

1353
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,410
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular case is if the</font>

1354
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,520
information is already given out then

1355
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:39,828
you can do something better with it

1356
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we have the information so the</font>

1357
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:44,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">first piece that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> asked about</font>

1358
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,479
was why would an operator want to give

1359
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:49,600
this out to farmville an operator would

1360
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,320
want to give this out so that when with

1361
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,210
and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a different</font>

1362
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,490
example of silverlight or<font color="#CCCCCC"> adobe move</font>

1363
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:57,580
with their control channel / variable

1364
00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:59,379
bitrate video right now the api's look

1365
00:51:57,580 --> 00:52:01,509
like you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can open up and sorry they work</font>

1366
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:04,150
over multiple tcp sessions to begin with

<font color="#E5E5E5">and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> API looks like oh you have a</font>

00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,840
that every programmer does a thousand is

1372
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:15,910
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero so therefore I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,840
turn this up to a thousand it's the

00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,210
number one thing that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> done they</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">that control channel to deliver the best</font>

1378

1379
00:52:24,430 --> 00:52:30,129
them to do if instead underneath silver

answer the first gentleman's question

1409
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:51,368
about economics um but the real worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody touched on at the privacy</font>

1411
00:53:51,369 --> 00:54:00,630
issue the security issue this is a

1412
00:53:56,190 --> 00:54:03,220
complex evolution of something that God

1413
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:06,070
died about three times used to be called

1414
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:09,490
active networking and and those things

1415
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:14,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">and wondering and they all died on the</font>

00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:16,660
security vine and wondering that seemed

1417
00:54:14,109 --> 00:54:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be kind of missing here the security</font>

00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:22,629
privacy the the network neutrality

1419
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:25,780
issues are in a sense part of that etc

1420
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:28,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">and when I don't hear it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I worry that</font>

00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,890
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to paint it on afterwards</font>

1422
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:34,300
and we know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that works with</font>

security again we're gonna have

00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:49,690
wonderful weather here this week in

1428
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:51,940
Philadelphia so the security issue I

1429
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:53,050
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've fundamentally so at</font>

1430
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:54,250
first of all obviously I didn't

1431
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,869
fundamentally address it there is no

1432
00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:00,160
doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that branding others are</font>

1433
00:54:55,869 --> 00:55:01,510
correct<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also didn't I believe mention</font>

1434
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,160
anything that isn't already done or

1435
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:05,140
isn't already known in particular when I

1436
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:07,569
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at how networks are trying</font>

00:55:16,090 --> 00:55:19,570

1443
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,130
a problem that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm completely</font>

1444
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:21,980
sidestepping and I'm completely

00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:24,460
sidestepped

1446
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,680
because what I'm trying to do is

1447
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:30,800
potentially remove all of the deep

1448
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:32,569
packet<font color="#CCCCCC"> foo bars etc and instead if if an</font>

1449
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:34,580
application does want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put something</font>

1450
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:36,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">on a particular network they can at</font>

1452
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,240

silver tongue this Randy and basically

1454
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:46,640
say I'm either punting or I'm doing

1455
00:55:44,450 --> 00:55:49,819
something otherwise but if I can remove

00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:58,490
and open this up for active

geolocation specifically and some of the

work that's been done in the IETF to
