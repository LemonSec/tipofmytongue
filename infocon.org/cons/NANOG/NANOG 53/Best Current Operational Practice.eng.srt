1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,469
ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh good</font>

2
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:24,210
good afternoon good afternoon all right

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,550
you guys are in the best<font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,890
operational peering track our best

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,910
current operational practices track so

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:38,550
if you intended to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere else</font>

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:40,140
stay here anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is a</font>

8
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,468
slightly larger audience than I expected

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:46,010
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> fantastic so here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> today to talk</font>

10
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,600
about best<font color="#E5E5E5"> current operational practices</font>

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,149
so first what is best current

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">operational practices the intent is to</font>

13
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:57,059
have some place<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have host living</font>

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:59,248
documents that is the antithesis of

15
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:00,870
things like nano presentations that as

16
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:04,470
soon as they're written and archived are

17
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,870
considered effectively stale it's to

18
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,929
have documents that are an<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8020 model so</font>

19
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:12,210
it covers the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of people's needs</font>

20
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:14,330
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the majority of</font>

21
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,710
sizes so we ignore off the one-off cases

22
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,330
certainly we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can know deltas and they</font>

23
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,369
can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in documents but they're not part</font>

24
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:23,460
of the main meat of the document to

25
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:25,290
cover the majority of people it's

26
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,710
intended to be community-based bottoms

27
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,480
up and transparent much like those<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

28
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,470
you are familiar with the air and policy

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,020
development process much like that

30
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:39,600
anyone can contribute so you can be an

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">author or a subject matter experts or</font>

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,179
maybe you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to know something</font>

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you maybe you want a b-cup develops that</font>

34
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,410
for either yourself or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community a</font>

35
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,680
few things should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be written certainly</font>

36
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:55,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">get up in this room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and say so or join</font>

37
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> list and request it and we'll try</font>

38
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and pair subject matter experts and</font>

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
authors and requesters together

40
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:12,180
a little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> history it's been about</font>

41
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,400
a year maybe a year and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a half since we</font>

42
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:17,130
brought up best current operational

43
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,540
practices started very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> few of us</font>

44
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,650
sitting at a table having a discussion

45
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,929
about how we could get living documents

46
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:28,920
hosted somewhere and keep them current

47
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:31,350
this concept evolved into a presentation

48
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,350
at both nanigen<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin to see if there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

49
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:38,519
some interest in this kind of forum

50
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:42,000
existing we launched a list bc p dash

51
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:45,239
discuss and a website<font color="#CCCCCC"> and a few tools to</font>

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,340
interact with documents we had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

53
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:50,790
discussion on a development process and

54
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> happened at tracks and on list and</font>

55
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,750
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little challenging to start a</font>

56
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,820
development process in a room<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

57
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,550
because we had roughly a<font color="#CCCCCC"> chicken-and-egg</font>

58
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,810
process right everybody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> meet</font>

59
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and nobody wants to work really hard to</font>

60
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:08,730
develop<font color="#E5E5E5"> the process so the the last 29</font>

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,220
hours ago we had this is track and

62
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,780
pretty much got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> go-ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from the</font>

63
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,660
room to just just go ahead and give it a

64
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,690
try right one find a few people get it

65
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,600
together and and launch it and get some

66
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,549
meat so we did that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it took a little</font>

67
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,859
longer than anticipated did not host

68
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:27,510
this track the last man<font color="#E5E5E5"> up there are</font>

69
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:29,790
some empty seats up here<font color="#E5E5E5"> too guys if you</font>

70
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:35,940
want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> nose up two rows that still</font>

71
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:38,880
some room there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lot of discussion</font>

72
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,190
about development process and so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

73
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,590
move forward basically I think what I

74
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,060
heard from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the room last time was we</font>

75
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:50,730
trust you just move forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we don't</font>

76
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:52,650
like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will scream so we did the</font>

77
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">development process developed outside of</font>

78
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:58,860
the meeting with few individuals then

79
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:02,670
back to list and and here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are today</font>

80
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,440
so the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> status</font>

81
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,079
we have a vest current operational

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,560
practices development process draft it's

83
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:14,650
been written discussed on list in a lot

84
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">of private conversations it's what we</font>

85
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,120
think is a pretty good development

86
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:21,839
process to move forward it does need

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,180
ratification but it exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> in draft form</font>

88
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:29,198
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be cop drafts so we actually</font>

89
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:31,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some meat yay one on ipv6</font>

90
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,990
submitting and one on public peering

91
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:36,729
exchange interface can fix we've

92
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,990
identified some gaps and some changes

93
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:40,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">which you do the address so we've got</font>

94
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,520
things like you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know names where it</font>

95
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,020
lives like so we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp discuss list</font>

96
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">up behind calm and we have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website</font>

97
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,130
on six<font color="#E5E5E5"> connect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a touareg and we have you</font>

98
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,429
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> some things that are still called</font>

99
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:54,960
bcp instead of<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcop so we've identified</font>

100
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,960
a list of things that need to be done

101
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,729
and you know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mentioned there's some</font>

102
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,669
housekeeping so we still have documents

103
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:09,370
with PCP we need to put this on a

104
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,310
different domain Richard I think looked

105
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:14,110
up a few domains and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> Park some</font>

106
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,030
that we have suggestions and will bring

107
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,830
up here to discuss and hopefully we can

108
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:19,388
get some agreement in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so we can</font>

109
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,880
just move forward and put<font color="#CCCCCC"> some place</font>

110
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:28,139
consistent and we realized while writing

111
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,389
some of the process documentation that

112
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:33,820
by laws are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> BCPs and therefore don't</font>

113
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:37,840
really follow<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same process and</font>

114
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,580
location and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we need to write</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

115
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,840
few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we need a place to put a</font>

116
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:43,419
few things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've still got a few</font>

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,638
processes used to sort out but for the

118
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:48,000
most part I think we've got a good place

119
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,000
to start

120
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:57,750
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to start with the reviewing</font>

121
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:04,530
and ratification hopefully of the beak

122
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:08,000
off development process drafts here and

123
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:08,000
then we'll go<font color="#CCCCCC"> into some of the meat</font>

124
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:58,099
okay okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a draft we're</font>

125
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,090
certainly not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read every word</font>

126
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:05,750
of this but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

127
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:07,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> over some of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> main points you want</font>

128
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to present them summarizing some of the</font>

129
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:22,070
stuff yeah my colleague Richard Richard

130
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,820
Donaldson at six connect as well spend

131
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:28,700
the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this document</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it was</font>

132
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,190
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> best that he summarized it hi</font>

133
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:33,050
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm Richard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> donelson with</font>

134
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:35,660
colleague<font color="#E5E5E5"> barons at six connect and just</font>

135
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,880
by show of hands first of all who's on

136
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,820
the list and who's on the actual be cop

137
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,070
list and is seen as ocular<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's</font>

138
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,060
kind of what i<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest of you</font>

139
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,590
this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first time you've actually</font>

140
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,090
seen this document so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

141
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,770
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit tedious so from just a</font>

142
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:51,890
procedural point of view we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,120
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss the actual meet</font>

145
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,640
the be cops that we've generated if it's

146
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,080
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to suggest and we can</font>

147
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,940
do a show of hands here that perhaps

148
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,950
people sign up for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> be cop discuss</font>

149
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,540
list we could submit this back out

150
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:07,039
rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than go through it because it's</font>

151
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,410
about four or five pages kind of written

152
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,610
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> format but in summary is that</font>

153
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:12,740
you can see from up here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

154
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,080
beginning we've modeled this after<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

155
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,150
tried to model it after existing

156
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,270
development processes for instance at

157
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Erin or the IETF kind of stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so in</font>

158
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:25,490
that vein this is written for the beat

159
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,900
cop again it's sort of up to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> group</font>

160
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:28,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">on what they want to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because this is</font>

161
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,960
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be less interesting than I</font>

162
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:31,450
think actually talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the to be</font>

163
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,390
cops that were written for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this session</font>

164
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:38,799
so even by nod of heads because<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font>

165
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,799
the dry part that's not as much fun

166
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">font colors right type it all right so</font>

167
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,110
in any event<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's again from a quick</font>

168
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:53,689
summary standpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erin Chris Jason</font>

169
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,339
Schiller myself and a couple others put

170
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,019
this document together have gone through

171
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,970
it a few times this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see the</font>

172
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:01,250
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> number it set right now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

173
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,439
ultimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> goal post this meeting will be</font>

174
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:04,579
too in fact get this kind of ratified so

175
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:06,620
that everyone can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the process</font>

176
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:09,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">will look like the two parts that are</font>

177
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,329
here basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> broken up our part one</font>

178
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:15,790
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of giving a philosophy behind the V</font>

179
00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,790
cop which again<font color="#E5E5E5"> Erin's talk mostly about</font>

180
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,579
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> studios I'll decide yeah just slide</font>

181
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:31,730
down a little bit get into right yeah

182
00:09:28,579 --> 00:09:33,769
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> transparent bottoms up and ongoing</font>

183
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,269
so those were the four bullet points you

184
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:36,829
can take out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the philosophical side</font>

185
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:39,410
of this again the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font>

186
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:41,508
everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has been done in an odds</font>

187
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,160
in generating any kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other</font>

188
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:44,899
operational practices that you see out

189
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:47,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">there in the air and community to have</font>

190
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">an inclusive participated participation</font>

191
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:51,979
from everybody to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> documents</font>

192
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,750
created so from that standpoint that's

193
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,579
kind of the philosophy and then part two

194
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,220
actually dives into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual process</font>

195
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:59,630
you will see that process on display

196
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,240
with the to be cops that have been

197
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:04,490
written for today so again we can fast

198
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,740
over this release it to everybody once

199
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,880
you get on the list get a chance to kind

200
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,529
of read through this and if there any

201
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,839
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> post that we can actually call</font>

202
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,839
for ratification via the list if that's

203
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,100
acceptable yeah so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some heads</font>

204
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so I think it can be more</font>

205
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,370
interesting to dive into the actual b

206
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,199
cups ipv6 subnetting and the peering be

207
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:25,670
cop had been written for today so if

208
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:28,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's okay with everybody will kind of</font>

209
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:29,300
fast over this stuff release it that way

210
00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:30,860
you can read<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on your own we can get</font>

211
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,120
comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> from people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can discuss</font>

212
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,920
it afterwards we'll be around obviously

213
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,180
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole conference you can come up</font>

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,449
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask individual questions if you'd</font>

215
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:39,400
like that word work great<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we'll do</font>

216
00:10:38,449 --> 00:11:07,089
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

217
00:10:39,400 --> 00:11:09,579
Oh take alexis fair enough all right so

218
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:12,520
that being said we can jump into some of

219
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:17,350
the meat so we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with submitting</font>

220
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:19,210
for ipv6 and Chris will give you a

221
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit summary of what's going on</font>

222
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

223
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,290
you

224
00:11:53,640 --> 00:12:00,030
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is meant to be the best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current</font>

225
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,310
operational practices for ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> Samba</font>

226
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:03,810
dating which basically means ipv6

227
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,839
address architectures right how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

228
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:08,819
lay<font color="#CCCCCC"> out your network how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you set up</font>

229
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,350
and break up<font color="#E5E5E5"> your active e6 allocation</font>

230
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:14,070
in such a way that it actually works for

231
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ongoing we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going read the summer</font>

232
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,920
here it does this<font color="#CCCCCC"> B cop aims to provide</font>

233
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,480
general I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> take subnetting</font>

234
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,069
guidelines they can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> followed by any</font>

235
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,660
network operator when planning and

236
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:23,670
implementing an ipv6 network deployment

237
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,589
the primary<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus is on understanding</font>

238
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:28,199
happy music subnets and addressing plans

239
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:30,210
creating operational clarity and future

240
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,370
proofing and so you know big part of

241
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:35,070
this obviously comes that moving to

242
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,790
active e6 is a paradigm shift especially

243
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,740
when it comes to addressing

244
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,120
architectures we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been counting</font>

245
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,190
addresses for a very long time without

246
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">before and deploying IP addresses in the</font>

247
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:44,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">most efficient way possible with regards</font>

248
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,520
to the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of addresses that we're</font>

249
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:48,900
actually using and the sea change that

250
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens when you moved out to be 6 is</font>

251
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,020
that you no longer care about individual

252
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,569
addresses at all they're completely

253
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,670
irrelevant and now networks are what

254
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,560
matter and we have enough addresses and

255
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,150
enough networks that you can actually

256
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">make a sane addressing plan from the</font>

257
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,620
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning that will scale and allow</font>

258
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,480
your network to grow and allow really

259
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,730
easy configurations really easy to read

260
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,100
IP addresses really easy to understand

261
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,060
hierarchy within your addressing plan

262
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,800
which we just couldn't have done<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

263
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that before except for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe in the very</font>

264
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,800
beginning if you've got you know 2 / 8

265
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,090
or something so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go to the next slide</font>

266
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,069
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beat cop itself obviously has a lot</font>

267
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:25,020
of description and stuff behind this

268
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll go through kind of the the top</font>

269
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,980
points here and then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss them</font>

270
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,569
I think so the first one is every

271
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,390
individual network<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment requires that</font>

272
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,820
minimum 1 / 64 prefix anybody who's

273
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,740
familiar with ipv6 at all probably

274
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:42,870
understands that there's a requirement

275
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the RFC to use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 64-bit interface IDs</font>

276
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,800
and so basically slacks built on that

277
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,960
everything's built on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so really you</font>

278
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,250
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to go below / 64 for one</font>

279
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:55,680
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> network the beach up here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is only</font>

280
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,150
subnet on nibble boundaries so a<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

281
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">boundary is half of a bite it's four</font>

282
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:01,920
bits so what that does is it allows your

283
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:03,479
addresses to look a lot nicer it allows

284
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">them to be much more human readable it</font>

285
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:07,839
allows you to understand what come

286
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:10,839
next much easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from you</font>

287
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,820
know 2001<font color="#CCCCCC"> calling DBA colon 100 colon</font>

288
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,990
colon slash whatever if you're doing

289
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,760
nibble boundaries like if you're doing /

290
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">44 exempt right it would go to from 100</font>

291
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,480
to 200 to 300 or 400 and it makes it

292
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">really easy to understand what's coming</font>

293
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,420
next instead of doing something off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

294
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:26,649
nibble boundary where you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be going</font>

295
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">from you know 102 182</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to 40 and it just</font>

296
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">becomes a lot harder to count that way</font>

297
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:34,329
it as implement a hierarchical

298
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,230
addressing plan to allow for aggregation

299
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,880
and so what we mean there is basically

300
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,339
you set out your site's individual

301
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,079
locations these could be buildings they

302
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,730
could be floors they could be campuses

303
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,769
whatever it makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you on the</font>

304
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:49,630
base level of<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically a site and then</font>

305
00:14:47,769 --> 00:14:51,250
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have regions above that and</font>

306
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,720
then you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have you know your</font>

307
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,800
overall asked above that and some

308
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:59,320
networks may make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have more</font>

309
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:01,719
than three layers but the the big<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

310
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,130
there is that you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> / 48</font>

311
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,990
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need more than one network</font>

312
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:06,640
just go to a / 48 it's really easy

313
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,920
you're going to have plenty of addresses

314
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,589
plenty of networks and then basically

315
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,969
count those up in your largest site

316
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,370
whatever your largest site needs for

317
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:17,380
growth fake for five years take that

318
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:19,660
rounded up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a nibble boundary and then</font>

319
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,560
use that for all of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> sites right</font>

320
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,130
even for whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have others that</font>

321
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,119
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very small and then again at the</font>

322
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,380
regional level you look at the biggest

323
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">region with the most number of sites</font>

324
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,950
project its growth out for<font color="#E5E5E5"> five years</font>

325
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,140
round that up to a nibble boundary set

326
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:34,990
that as your regional address subnet and

327
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:37,149
and then you know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> top</font>

328
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:40,240
level so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are some examples that</font>

329
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:42,339
are in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> be cop this is for a you know</font>

330
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,630
multi-campus network and so this this

331
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:46,089
one's fairly simple you just have a few

332
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:48,520
buildings in each region or and you know

333
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:49,690
you a / 48 to each building and then

334
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,920
within the region so basically this

335
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,230
one's easy because you only have three

336
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:56,680
sites within each region within the

337
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:58,660
largest region and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it bumps up to</font>

338
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,029
/ 44 which is the next nibble up from a

339
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:03,310
48 and then you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go again from a</font>

340
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:05,170
nibble to that on the top so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it</font>

341
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,459
here shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last thing I was talking</font>

342
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nib load line boundaries</font>

343
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:10,149
so you can see if you're using if you

344
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">haven't you know / 32 and you break it</font>

345
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,110
into 36<font color="#CCCCCC"> ha's which is on a nibble</font>

346
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,540
boundary you get this easy 1000 2000

347
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:19,480
3000 so on and so forth

348
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:23,800
if you break it into something<font color="#CCCCCC"> else like</font>

349
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:26,290
a / 37 you can see it goes 800-1000 1860

350
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,819
you know and it's it's much less logical

351
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:29,050
it's much less easy to just look at

352
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">without doing bit math and actually</font>

353
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,670
figuring it out and so because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font>

354
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,349
the bits to spare there's no reason not

355
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:43,060
to just use them make it easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

356
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:46,830
yourself um go back to the slide real

357
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:49,780
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nori's so then so then</font>

358
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:51,880
after the aggregation right the next

359
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,730
thing is basically you're gonna want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

360
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,110
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 / 48 from each region and reserve</font>

361
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,670
that for infrastructure so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need your</font>

362
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:59,440
point-to-point links you need your loop

363
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,490
backs and you'd all that stuff and so

364
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,350
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you just take either the</font>

365
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,030
first or the last / 48 out of whatever

366
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:05,620
that regional prefix is and make sure

367
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:07,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> count that in when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're planning</font>

368
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">your size then you can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use that and</font>

369
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:12,160
carve it up for whatever you need it for

370
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,899
infrastructure wise within that you

371
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,360
probably want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the very first /</font>

372
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,270
64 whether you call it the top or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

373
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:21,569
least specific or whichever way you want

374
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">to say it basically if you had you know</font>

375
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:27,730
2001 colon deviate colon colon slash 32

376
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,810
and you took the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first 48 of that and</font>

377
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,730
you want to take the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> left in</font>

378
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,129
support of that so it'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> be 2001 colon</font>

379
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:34,090
DBA colon colon slash 64 right because

380
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:38,350
then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have a really easy</font>

381
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:40,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Cohen Cohen whatever for your loot bags</font>

382
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,370
one thing to note with doing loopback

383
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:44,230
addresses a lot of folks have a common

384
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:45,969
use what if you have like the numbering

385
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,710
scheme where you have like r1 r2 r3 for

386
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:51,460
your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of times people use</font>

387
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:53,080
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know just dot 1223 whatever for</font>

388
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:54,820
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> lube backs you can still do that</font>

389
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:58,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">one thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember in ipv6 we're</font>

390
00:17:54,820 --> 00:18:00,520
doing hex so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 does not come after 9a</font>

391
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,050
does but it doesn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter right</font>

392
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,240
i mean you could still just call it if

393
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:05,860
you have like an hour 9 or 10 or 11 you

394
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,880
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still just go colon colon 9 Clint I</font>

395
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,530
mean you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually being</font>

396
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,590
sequential but it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really matter</font>

397
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,690
i guess and then for point-to-point

398
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:16,360
links so right now it<font color="#CCCCCC"> looks like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

399
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:20,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">best thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is to allocate a full /</font>

400
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:23,409
64 out of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 and then but actually</font>

401
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,150
configure either / 126 or / 127 and the

402
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:28,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason for that is if you allocate the</font>

403
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,690
entire / 64 you end up with again very

404
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">human readable address</font>

405
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,820
you don't have to if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you take it full 64</font>

406
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:36,080
and break it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up into 127 s then once you</font>

407
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,850
get further and further down in there

408
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,990
you've got a lot more hex bits in there

409
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:40,129
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the address is start to get a lot</font>

410
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,240
more complicated and slide easier just

411
00:18:40,129 --> 00:18:43,519
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and say okay I know which</font>

412
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,009
router that is if you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do a sausage</font>

413
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,049
before for each link then you can say

414
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:50,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay this link you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know its individual</font>

415
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:52,940
networks are very easy to identify on

416
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:56,179
each link and the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the 126</font>

417
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:58,940
127 there is a new IETF draft all right

418
00:18:56,179 --> 00:19:00,470
now for being<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to use 127 s there's</font>

419
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:02,509
still a lot of gear out in the field

420
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that won't really work with 127 s and</font>

421
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:06,919
it's kind of rat hole i guess to get

422
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,039
into but there's some issues there with

423
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,779
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Indy cast addressing and things so</font>

424
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:13,759
basically as far as that goes test it in

425
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:15,169
your lab see which one works for you in

426
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,230
your particular environment with the

427
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:21,679
gear<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have deployed today well then</font>

428
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:23,840
the last thing is sites pops and

429
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,490
locations and regions etc should be laid

430
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,649
out such that within each level of the

431
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,700
hierarchy each subnet prefixes of equal

432

size and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually already talked about</font>

433
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,340
that quite a bit when I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

434
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,629
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hierarchical addressing so</font>

435
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,459
that not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only is a hierarchical but it</font>

436

437

438
00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:41,679
to do that you may<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

439
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:46,669

than an actual address an issue I would

504
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:35,380
a large oversizing factor that we felt

505
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,670
we would not have adequate utilization

506
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,640
in some places in the network to be able

509
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:48,250
in the Aaron region based on how the N

00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:08,830
that type of the utilization is not

00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,159
how if you need to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back for</font>

525
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,350
additional space that nimble boundaries

526
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:30,070
might be too large of an advertising

527
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:33,399
factor in your calculations at verizon

528
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:38,649
business what size of network does that

529
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:41,550
break at the question is only related to

530
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,600
of course subsequent allocations right

531
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:45,250
yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean certainly if you're never</font>

532
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:50,209
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it / 32 it</font>

533
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:53,310
doesn't matter right so

534
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,560
is it a 20 I think even a medium-sized

535
00:23:53,310 --> 00:24:01,320
transit provider probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't going to</font>

536
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:03,929
need more than a 32 yeah so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

537
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:06,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably a great like 20 piece it's more</font>

538
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a caveat for very large networks very</font>

539
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:14,070
large networks and networks outside of

540
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:17,070
the US as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um certainly</font>

541
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,470
notable I imagine that the other rirs

542
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,780
will probably lean towards a similar

543
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,920
utilization policy shortly anyway right

544
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,240
i mean this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about operational</font>

545
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,580
practice not about meeting policy you

546
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">know hopefully we can actually work the</font>

547
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,030
other way which is get people to change

548
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:36,360
their policies to meet operational

549
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:37,470
practices that would be fantastic the

550
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,330
only other<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I think is worth</font>

551
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:40,830
pointing out is as you've said before it

552
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:42,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a huge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of space that you get</font>

553
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,919
when you do these six so that gives you

554
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:46,710
greater flexibility to do things like

555
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,600
group customers base together group

556
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,490
infrastructure space together group

557
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,929
internal corporate network space

558
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:55,740
together which makes<font color="#CCCCCC"> your fire whirl</font>

559
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:58,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">filters easier that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great point that</font>

560
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,430
should be included lightning

561
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:10,630
let any questions comments on V 670 so

562
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,920
normally of course the idea is that

563
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:14,320
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the document text in your</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hand before these meetings so obviously</font>

565
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,530
this is a mild chicken and egg problem

566
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:22,540
but because<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably worth you know</font>

567
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:26,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting this out to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> list and should</font>

568
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,330
be fairly accurate the idea would be

569
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:29,590
that we have some list discussion

570
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,449
between these meetings and had these

571
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:36,610
meetings we need to ratify them or not

572
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:38,800
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a starting point I think it's</font>

573
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:40,719
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great one and i think the document is</font>

574
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:43,060
very well written the nice thing again

575
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,110
about the the versioning just as Jason

576
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,060
mentioned you had a few points that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

577
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:48,550
good suggestions is that they're living

578
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,710
so even ratifying documents in any given

579
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:54,760
state as long as they're deemed accurate

580
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:57,010
by subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter experts and a large</font>

581
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,050
group of Engineers is still current and

582
00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:01,110
accurate and can be ratified and move

583
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,070
forward and<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> change or</font>

584
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,929
suggestion or something needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

585
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:07,210
added or something is now deprecated and

586
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:10,030
needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be changed we can bring it up</font>

587
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,800
on list or in a room<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this and get</font>

588
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:24,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">it version drafted to the next version</font>

589
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:26,590
and ratified I think that's that's

590
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,230
certainly so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was do we have</font>

591
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:32,350
a last call process right but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

592
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:35,050
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> one written down yet but you know</font>

593
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">that certainly that this part of just</font>

594
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:38,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">going through this we're going to figure</font>

595
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:40,030
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the first couples we figured that</font>

596
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:41,860
these wouldn't be too challenging and

597
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:44,740
people would generally agree with what's

598
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:47,040
written in both of these so it should be

599
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:50,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly easy to take the risk to just</font>

600
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:52,990
ratify move forward and and debate on

601
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:57,790
list and so on for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next ones and</font>

602
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:59,910
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll learn as we go Thanks thank</font>

603
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">you</font>

604
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:18,570
alright so next mike is going to comment

605
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:22,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">on his or summarizes document</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DCOP on</font>

606

607
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:28,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">kopi so I'm Mike Smith I'm actually with</font>

608
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,790
that host but I'm also one of the

609
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,180
operators of the Seattle internet

610
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:35,129
exchange and this document was written

611
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,270
kind of as a response to what we see

612
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,740
from people that connect into the

613
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:40,650
exchange and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of traffic that we</font>

614
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,590
see suffice it to say that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see enough</font>

615
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,540
what we consider to be odd or not wanted

616
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:47,629
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a document like this we</font>

617
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:51,240
felt would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful for our</font>

618
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:54,260
constituency and hopefully for others as

619
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,550
well is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Florian in the room hey Florian</font>

620
00:27:54,260 --> 00:28:05,340
so the great thing about the beat cop oh

621
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:06,990
sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> DCOP process is the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I had sent</font>

622
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,730
this document out and I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

623
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,100
author on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent it out for comments</font>

624
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,290
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Florian kind of came up and said</font>

625
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:15,300
well what about this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about this</font>

626
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,010
and we got into<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a few discussions</font>

627
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:20,040
about what we consider to be acceptable

628
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:21,660
behavior in particular situations most

629
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,760
specifically around how do you connect

630
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:26,070
to exchange can you connect directly can

631
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,810
you go layer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> layer to network can you</font>

632
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:29,520
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through a transit provider etc etc</font>

633
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:33,629
and so the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> was expanded to</font>

634
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,550
accommodate those other types of

635
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,710
connections the one thing that this

636
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:39,450
document does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay out is actual</font>

637
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:42,120
configuration examples for any

638
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:45,450
particular vendor I know on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle</font>

639
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,729
internet exchange we have I mean every

640
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,200
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> time we have provided with a</font>

641
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:50,460
problem it's always on a new piece of

642
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">gear or something that we haven't seen</font>

643
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:57,360
before it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately be expanded</font>

644
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:59,250
to include configuration examples a lot

645
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">of those exist on each of the individual</font>

646
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,700
vendors and if you follow the guidelines

647
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:05,399
of what you should turn off which is

648
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:07,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">really what this document is about you</font>

649
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:09,210
can do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> through your vendors website</font>

650
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,740
but if anybody wanted to contribute and

651
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,240
say this is the configuration example

652
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,580
for a cisco for a juniper

653
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,660
the auto whatever you want to use those

654
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:25,409
are certainly appreciated so we started

655
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:29,220
with the physical<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer guidelines there</font>

656
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:31,490
we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> we on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same page yep and so the</font>

657
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:34,110
direct connect to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> exchange obviously</font>

658
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:37,200
this is preferred a layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 interface</font>

659
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:39,000
into the exchange the exchange in almost

660
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,610
all cases cases is a layer 2

661
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,590
infrastructure and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a lot of</font>

662
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:45,178
inherent dangers by connecting layer to

663
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:47,820
delay or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two so if you've got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physical</font>

664
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:49,650
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 interface into the exchange</font>

665
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:54,030
that's always preferable at least from

666
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:56,250
the operators perspective then<font color="#E5E5E5"> in to you</font>

667
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:57,960
can also have remote peering thanks to

668
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:01,200
fluorine for the for the for the

669
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,640
graphics which would be something like

670
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">this where you have some kind of carrier</font>

671
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,530
connection in between your participant

672
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:08,640
in the exchange fabric in many cases<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,990
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about an exchange may</font>

674
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,390
have people that are connecting into it

675
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,470
from hundreds of miles away so we didn't

676
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:14,670
want to exclude that and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> well you</font>

677
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:16,050
can't do that because it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a direct</font>

680

681
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:25,950
the third<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the reseller ports which</font>

682
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,399
of course is a single carrier selling to

683
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:31,050
multiple enterprises and we see a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

684
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:34,220
that on the six as well in fact we see

685
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:37,740
people selling transit over the cigs

686
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,330
some of this if you come from the telco

and if your exchange point connections

00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:30,399
are critical to you that adds time that

got our own air<font color="#E5E5E5"> in assigned space and</font>

a little bit but you can see CDP FTP and

we do see things will see<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP come up</font>

752
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:21,129
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've got it filtered</font>

00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:31,090
needs to be blocked in some way now we

757
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,379
we do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of this blocking on the</font>

switch side as well on the on the

exchange side but we would prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

760
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:41,940
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was taken care of already</font>

761
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:44,280
and of course all<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp protocols please</font>

762
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:50,700
there are passive interfaces please use

763
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:53,879
them now<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mac address we do mac</font>

764
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:55,230
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> ackles on our side so if you say</font>

765
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,160
that you're a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single entity connecting</font>

766
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:58,710
into the switch we're going to filter

00:33:56,160 --> 00:34:00,600
u21 mac a lot of times if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have an</font>

00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:02,640
intermediate switch switch that switch

769
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,169
will present its MAC address along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

the mac address of the layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 interface</font>

771
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:07,440
so that's something that you want to

772
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">take into account because you'll get a</font>

773
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:18,929
port security violation and ultimately

774
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:20,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">shut down now this one number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one we had</font>

775
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,600
a lot of discussion about this on the

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">six list and we went with must not and</font>

777
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,350
we'll see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> people feel about that</font>

778
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:32,668
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little research and you</font>

779
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:35,130
can see lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of exchange / 24 / 23 s in</font>

780
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:39,000
the global routing table we're saying

00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:41,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you must not announce that IP space</font>

782
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,440
into your routing table and into your

783
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:46,939
customers tables it's not necessary it

784
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,320
doesn't break anything so please don't

785
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,360
there's no reason that anybody needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

786
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,860
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that subnet directly they can get</font>

788
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,430
our side we would prefer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you did</font>

789
00:34:57,090 --> 00:35:02,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">not but we said mas but it could be</font>

790
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:06,480
 on as well the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

791
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,390
we see quite a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about and we've</font>

792
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,010
gotten feedback from our peers is that

793
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,779
someone will come<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the exchange and</font>

794
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,820
they'll have a script that goes out and

795
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,610
scrapes every provider<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's on the</font>

796
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,900
exchange auto configures the<font color="#E5E5E5"> BGP</font>

797
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:23,610
sessions and leaves them there in an

798
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:26,520
active state forever please don't do

799
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:28,260
that one by one<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you get a new pair</font>

800
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,390
turn it up you can use your scripts at

801
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,770
that point but auto configuring all of

802
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:33,000
this so that sits<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an active state</font>

803
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:34,920
means that it's pumping out traffic

804
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,950
looking for those peers on a regular

805
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:39,240
basis<font color="#CCCCCC"> and if you've got 200 beers on an</font>

806
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:45,810
exchange that's a lot of unwanted

807
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:49,620
traffic oh yeah number<font color="#CCCCCC"> five the please</font>

808
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:50,580
do every exchange has an address<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

809
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,520
they send out information

810
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,529
and I know this seems kind of obvious

811
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,170
but a lot of the times your key people

812
00:35:55,530 --> 00:36:00,990
won't be on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that list and so when things</font>

813
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:03,120
happen you won't know why<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the</font>

814
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,560
appropriate people aren't subscribed so

815
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,940
please do subscribe the appropriate

816
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,690
people to whatever lists are available

817
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:12,990
for the exchanges that you're on and

818
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:14,610
finally in this section please do

819
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:18,180
turndown sessions and actually delete

820
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,770
them same thing somebody goes away you

821
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,690
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> we send out what we do is we change</font>

822
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:24,810
the dns that says departed please remove

823
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:28,980
and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through rtcp dumps</font>

824
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:31,590
every night we have at least half of our

825
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,630
peers have at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 active sessions</font>

and finally the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> guidelines is kind</font>

829
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:48,150
of generic well stuff that didn't fit

security mechanisms not very many we're

00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:57,330
not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go into kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the newer</font>

stuff that Randy's working on md5 some

00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,529
people have it I mean obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

835
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:04,919
just a should you can we don't advise it

it in there because I know that some

839
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,080
people do it we have found personally

840

having exchanged to exchange connections

841

with mac address controls that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

hard to keep those<font color="#E5E5E5"> updated and if</font>

00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,110
somebody changes a router at three

848
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,510
know what those are probably good idea

849
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,710
to use them GT sm was just recommended

850
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,970
today it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that I've put</font>

851
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:38,070
into place so it was it's the TTL hack

852
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,810
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again should enable if you can and</font>

853
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:42,960
if it's obviously providers on both

854
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:45,540
sides are supporting it number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

855
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,250
hearing DB is a is a big one does

856
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:52,259
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> know does anybody not know</font>

857
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:55,850
what the peering DB is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so please do</font>

858
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:55,850
have appearing DB updated

859
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:03,759
what would you call it form input it's

860
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,020
important that's kind of the easy place

861
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,670
where everybody goes to find information

862
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:08,950
I know on the six<font color="#E5E5E5"> pages that's what we</font>

863
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,270
link to so if somebody's looking for

864
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:12,490
information on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your network how to get</font>

865
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,600
in touch with you what IP space you

866
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:16,330
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> or should not be announcing</font>

867
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:18,190
that's where you go and of course with

868
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:22,120
the routing registry everybody knows

869
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:24,820
what that is we say must have up-to-date

870
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:28,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">objects hopefully ones that you added</font>

871
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:33,690
and weren't added for you in 1994 it is

872
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:41,110
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so the conclusion really</font>

873
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:42,550
was kind of just a change to the just be

874
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,960
liberal in what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> or be conservative</font>

875
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,360
what you send and conservative on what

876
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,900
you receive unfortunately because of the

877
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:53,680
layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 nature</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of exchanges being loose</font>

878
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:56,470

your peers but downstream put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in your</font>

901
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:58,990

<font color="#E5E5E5">we started and we went back and forth i</font>

905
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:06,930
we have a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people who are</font>

00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:09,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">really intensely committed to know</font>

907

administrative for this I'm not sure but

910
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:21,910
one of my pet peeves is people that send

911
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,310
out emails to everybody that's in an IX

912
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:27,040
so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hearing with them but they</font>

913
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:30,130
send me we're doing maintenance or we're

914
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,009
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> here where I don't care so could</font>

00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:38,560
there's etiquette to who you<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing don't</font>

917
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,210
send those notices to because you really

918
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,730
shouldn't be sending that to people that

919
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,330
you're not actually puring with we have

920
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,320
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> six well we have two</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different mechanisms we've got a</font>

922
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,800
broadcast mechanism where we can send

923
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,540
things out that's not a reply to list

924
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,560
and that's really the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that I was</font>

925
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:54,850
kind of referring to for the

926
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,040
subscriptions we also have a members

927
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:58,450
list which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the one that you</font>

want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> subscribe your knock</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to because</font>

929
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:02,589
that's one where everybody says we're

930
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,150
doing maintenance it extracts yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think some of them are</font>

932
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:07,600
actually even just pulling the whole

933
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:10,090
list and making your own personal which

934
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:13,270
so that means we have to actually say

935
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,400
hey dummies don't do that sorry I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

936
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:17,680
calling me down them but<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

937
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,900

I get enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> email already does</font>

940
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:30,660
everybody think that's ok to add as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

941
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:32,660
thank you you bet<font color="#E5E5E5"> Louis the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Equinix I</font>

see where model is coming from on that

943
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:37,859
so yes develop your own internal man

944
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:43,020
list who announced to your peers on a

945

per site basis thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much for</font>

to contribute more to this another an

update I'd like to offer is that not

949
00:41:53,279 --> 00:41:58,700
only let your NOC know about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main</font>

951
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:05,549
deal with issues on ni x because they're

959
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:52,560
really appreciate appreciated the effort

960
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:54,980
about bgp security mechanisms I mean I'm

961
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,190
curious why you decided to not

962
00:42:54,980 --> 00:43:00,780
specifically recommend md5 and also do

963
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:06,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think that there should be mention</font>

964
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">of TTL bgp security well the GT sm is is</font>

965
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:14,700
in there as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i should the md5 that's kind</font>

966
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:18,870
of really<font color="#E5E5E5"> between two providers is that</font>

967
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,980
we put it in as a may personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font>

968
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,259
a big fan of it just because of the

969
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:25,050
processor overhead for what I consider

970
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,940
to be very little<font color="#E5E5E5"> benefit but that's a</font>

971
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,830
personal preference so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

972
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,300
kind of put it in as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> may and in fact</font>

973
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:32,069
any security mechanism that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

974
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put on a connection is a may as far</font>

975
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,310
as the exchange is concerned because

976
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:38,310
whether or not your<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices actually</font>

977
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:41,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure doesn't necessarily affect the</font>

978
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:44,509
exchange itself necessarily right but I

979
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean I would consider it a best practice</font>

980
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:48,750
because if you don't have md5 than

981
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,120
anyone else who's on the exchange could

982
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:55,700
spook your bgp partner right

983
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:57,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">fearing partner so seems like it's a</font>

984
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,000
best practice but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> people want to</font>

985
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:04,880
ignore the best practice that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:08,540
them yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> Scott library and response to</font>

988
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:14,210
due to mismatch to md5<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have heard of</font>

989
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:16,010
zero sessions down due to exploiting

990
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,120
that theoretical bug if anyone else has

991
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:20,240
heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those I'd like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear about</font>

992
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:24,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">them but so far md5 has been completely</font>

993
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,560
a break things for no reason feature

994
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:31,250
yeah if you're in the if you ever have

995
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,029
to swap out gear those empty five keys

996
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:40,760
are the first thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have</font>

997
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:45,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems with almost invariably thank</font>

998
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,820
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cheers</font>

999
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:58,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that's what we have four drafts</font>

1000
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:59,859
for today again since so many of these

1001
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,510
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> room are not</font>

1002
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,830
currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the list although I see</font>

1003
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:07,300
people subscribing to it while I'm

1004
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:09,730
sitting here we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have a</font>

1005
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:13,000
short window of time as a sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

1006
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:16,660
anomalous ratification process at least

1007
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,580
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two maybe give everybody a couple</font>

1008
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:21,339
of weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to read through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> text and</font>

1009
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:23,110
respond but but do keep in mind that

1010
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:25,170
again if there are changes that need to

1011
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:28,690
be made you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can certainly suggest</font>

1012
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:30,820
changing those would certainly like to

1013
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,260
see the development<font color="#E5E5E5"> process itself just</font>

1014
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:33,220
get ratified and move forward and if you

1015
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:34,450
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it you know you're a</font>

1016
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,609
community you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to</font>

1017
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:41,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">change it you just have to get enough</font>

1018
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:44,200
people to scream the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> direction so i</font>

1019
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,839
guess i should ask does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

1020
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:51,129
serious objections to us moving the

1021
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:54,280
least the draft process forward as

1022
00:45:51,130 --> 00:46:00,400
written today even<font color="#E5E5E5"> having not reviewed</font>

1023
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:02,740
it in great detail lovely then we will

1024
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">just simply ratify that one and you can</font>

1025
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:07,240
then read the ratification process in

1026
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:13,360
detail when we email it out to the list

1027
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:15,279
again so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still have some housekeeping</font>

1028
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,170
stuff but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I figured we'd keep it much</font>

1029
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:22,360
more interesting for the room first and

1030
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:24,310
start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed drafts so this can</font>

1031
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">be you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see something written</font>

1032
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:28,509
you're a subject matter expert you're

1033
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:31,839
volunteering to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something submit</font>

1034
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:35,200
ideas for DC<font color="#CCCCCC"> op's what would you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

1035
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:36,760
see written this is for the room um

1036
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,930
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested I mean you can</font>

1037
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">certainly do this on the list as well</font>

1038
00:46:37,930 --> 00:46:40,960
but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want to</font>

1039
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,940
discuss in terms of a best current

1040
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:48,220
operational practices draft document

1041
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:50,230
subject microphones yours one thing I'll

1042
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:51,730
add to that piece is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a you know looking</font>

1043
00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">at scope as well right so we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1044
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,720
keep most of these beasts<font color="#E5E5E5"> eops fairly</font>

1045
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,220
well scoped and so some of the things

1046
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're even already brought up like</font>

1047
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:01,149
I heard some you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1048
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:03,400
BP reinvest common practices perhaps and

1049
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,410
maybe just<font color="#CCCCCC"> technical mailing lists best</font>

1050
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,450
common operational practices perhapses

1051
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:18,480
to potential ideas already<font color="#CCCCCC"> drawn out</font>

1052
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:18,480
today anybody sorry

1053
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:28,730
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly one of the house of</font>

1054
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,078
people topics as well we'll go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1055
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,730
think we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> domains parked</font>

1056
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:34,880
and we should discuss them and just

1057
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:38,530
agree in the room and then change it but

1058
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,530
certainly still feel free open mic

1059
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:51,980
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> big b cup subjects i would</font>

1060
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:55,069
recommend<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like how to use</font>

1061
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:57,680
communities on your internal bgp network

1062
00:47:55,069 --> 00:48:00,980
to help<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're not identifying false</font>

1063
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:08,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">roots or something like that and i'm</font>

1064
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:11,710
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contribute hi I'm Ron</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bonica</font>

1065
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:17,530
from the IETF and I'm here to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1066
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:17,530
awesome just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a 12-step program</font>

1067
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:24,170
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> totally understand why this</font>

1068
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:27,530
wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be distinct from any IETF</font>

1069
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:29,450
working group because<font color="#E5E5E5"> hey your documents</font>

1070
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:32,230
are living<font color="#E5E5E5"> there changing they're not</font>

1071
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:34,730
looking to be rfcs anytime soon right

1072
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:38,809
also because you want input from the

1073
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:44,720
operator community only with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stars</font>

1074
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:46,730
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word only we might want some</font>

1075
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,950
level of integration between the two

1076
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:51,349
because there really are some things

1077
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:53,240
that the IETF can do to help you for

1078
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:56,839
instance I can offer you a mailing list

1079
00:48:53,240 --> 00:49:00,020
with archives if you'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to meet at</font>

1080
00:48:56,839 --> 00:49:05,390
the IETF you can or not depending on

1081
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:07,670
your needs at any given time if ever

1082
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:10,819
you'd like to progress anything from

1083
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:15,290
this mailing list to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> OPS area of bcp</font>

1084
00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:17,210
we can help with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

1085
00:49:15,290 --> 00:49:20,180
if you'd want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this is something for</font>

1086
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:22,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">this group to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think about if you want to</font>

1087
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:26,000
maintain your documents as

1088
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:28,400
internet-drafts we can have somebody

1089
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,630
refresh them so they never<font color="#E5E5E5"> die</font>

1090
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,760
there are some<font color="#CCCCCC"> good things about that</font>

1091
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:35,280
and some bad things about it the good

1092
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,260
things is some issues that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you haven't</font>

1093
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:40,220
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> about yet get thought about for</font>

1094
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:43,650
you like<font color="#E5E5E5"> IPR issues and copyright issues</font>

1095
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:47,009
the bad things is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bed parts are you</font>

1096
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:49,830
may not like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF IPR are copyright</font>

1097
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:51,420
policies you're certainly not going to

1098
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:54,150
be thrilled<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing everything and</font>

1099
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,670
asking yeah so in any event it's an

1100
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:59,250
offer take<font color="#E5E5E5"> it leave it no pressure</font>

1101
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:02,190
either way yeah thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so much</font>

1102
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:05,869
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had several people from</font>

1103
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:10,080
the ITF suggest that there were<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

1104
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:12,750
potential synergies and we should work

1105
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:14,970
together roll offering<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll get it</font>

1106
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:24,020
right I mean it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> community-driven</font>

1107
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:27,020
thing so great thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you other</font>

1108
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,020
topics

1109
00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:35,440
so Richard Donaldson again and actually

1110
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:37,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">commenting on what I'm hearing from the</font>

1111
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,130
room of all things which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the</font>

1112
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,160
documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see today that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> BT</font>

1113
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:44,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">okies I heard a lot of sort of this 8020</font>

1114
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:46,170
concept we're almost like a for dummies

1115
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,579
book<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe there's some call-outs</font>

1116
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:50,650
specifically in the grass so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font>

1117
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">to incorporate that into future versions</font>

1118
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,589
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> that be helpful for everybody</font>

1119
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,770
because there have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been some individual</font>

1120
00:50:53,589 --> 00:51:00,250
comments / these two<font color="#CCCCCC"> vco peas and so</font>

1121
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:01,869
would it be useful in light of that to

1122
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,339
incorporate that into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the documentation</font>

1123
00:51:01,869 --> 00:51:05,260
itself and again imposing that to the

1124
00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:07,240
group versus what you've seen today is a

1125
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,650
very kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of clean structured</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1126
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,910
here's the thing a living document that

1127
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:12,279
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been some</font>

1128
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:22,808
individual queries that might want to be

1129
00:51:12,279 --> 00:51:24,730
incorporated anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'll throw well</font>

1130
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:25,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">the question is in the documentation</font>

1131
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:28,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you saw today again this is the</font>

1132
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">first draft and so it's intended for</font>

1133
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,819
everyone here to<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but but</font>

1134
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:35,440
there were some individual specific

1135
00:51:33,819 --> 00:51:37,869
questions whether it was in the peering

1136
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,020
document or even the ipv6 subnetting

1137
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:43,869
document that may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to the</font>

1138
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,490
eighty percent if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> will rule but they</font>

1139
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:48,369
are useful to highlight for those twenty

1140
00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:51,549
percent anomalies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so is it useful to</font>

1141
00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:53,950
incorporate that into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the BTOP draft</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

1142
00:51:51,549 --> 00:51:55,690
ultimately ratified document almost like

1143
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:56,980
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have in a if you've ever read it for</font>

1144
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:58,720
dummies book<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have those call-outs</font>

1145
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:00,910
to kind of give you hear something to

1146
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:03,788
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of on a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discreet basis</font>

1147
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:06,009
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a general rule of thumb but</font>

1148
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:07,720
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to know that there are these</font>

1149
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:11,140
kind of anomalous situations that

1150
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:13,180
require that type of structure and so if

1151
00:52:11,140 --> 00:52:14,920
that's usefulness document is this is

1152
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:18,299
kind of progressing maybe we can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1153
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,299
incorporate that into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft process</font>

1154
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,750
and that's a fabulous comment that's

1155
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:43,130
exactly why is posing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a question because</font>

1156
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:45,590
it was out there but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a</font>

1157
00:52:43,130 --> 00:53:02,750
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggestion so okay just something</font>

1158
00:52:45,590 --> 00:53:04,520
to think about Jason<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schiller google and</font>

1159
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:07,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Richard specifically on your point I</font>

1160
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:09,590
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great idea I think that</font>

1161
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:12,259
there's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two cases for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this I</font>

1162
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:14,150
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first case is if you can</font>

1163
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:16,910
identify the edge cases that fall out of

1164
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:19,099
the eighty percent that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the this is good</font>

1165
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:20,930
advice for you can say look if you can

1166
00:53:19,099 --> 00:53:22,220
identify yourself as within<font color="#E5E5E5"> this twenty</font>

1167
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,779
percent this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually turns out to be</font>

1168
00:53:22,220 --> 00:53:25,520
bad advice for you and don't follow this

1169
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,950
I think that's very important to

1170
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,450
highlight right in this document I think

1171
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:30,740
if there's another document where we can

1172
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:33,259
capture some of these twenty percent

1173
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:34,520
cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be great if there isn't</font>

1174
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,900
another document I think that we should

1175
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:37,490
at least make reference to it that

1176
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're you know in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the twenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

1177
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:40,459
space there are some other things to

1178
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:42,560
consider and they are a B and C one

1179
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:44,950
paragraph at most maybe just as a

1180
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:47,450
call-out put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a separate section</font>

1181
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:50,779
that people can clearly skip if they're

1182
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:52,669
not in the twenty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent case yeah yeah</font>

1183
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:55,609
I also put those sort of generic

1184
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:57,440
template that we put together up on the

1185
00:53:55,609 --> 00:53:59,140
slide

1186
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,119
so you can see they has certainly

1187
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:05,270
caveats section of some flavor would be

1188
00:54:02,119 --> 00:54:07,670
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful thing yeah what I found</font>

1189
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:09,740
sorry um what I found while writing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1190
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:10,940
that could be 61 was<font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of made</font>

1191
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:13,578
<font color="#CCCCCC">sense to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it in line and so what I did</font>

1192
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:16,040
is I tried to italicize text and so for

1193
00:54:13,579 --> 00:54:17,839
instance with the / 64 subnet saying

1194
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,190
there's a note that it says no<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

1195
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:20,359
an italic and you know we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> work on</font>

1196
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:22,040
formatting issues and how to actually

1197
00:54:20,359 --> 00:54:23,420
include this right but just calling that

1198
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,900
out i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is definitely important</font>

1199
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:28,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do say hey hold on a second this you</font>

1200
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:30,440
know we may not apply especially if

1201
00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:31,700
specially its nearing where it may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1202
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,020
less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> the eighty percent right like</font>

1203
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're now you're like sixty percent</font>

1204
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:40,700
territory it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best thing to</font>

1205
00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:43,150
do but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wasn't changing topics so give</font>

1206
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:45,049
anyone else a chance to<font color="#CCCCCC"> speak on top</font>

1207
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking</font>

1208
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:49,069
for ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we touched on another</font>

1209
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:51,799
good one that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock operations</font>

1210
00:54:49,069 --> 00:54:55,220
we could outline things to auto respond

1211
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,720
rules knock s la's reach ability if

1212
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:00,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything for you to stop those knock on</font>

1213
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,160
nach bail bonds I'd be great but you

1214
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:02,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that's the sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1215
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:04,339
all run into<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually open up your</font>

1216
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">email you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 200 auto response so</font>

1217
00:55:04,339 --> 00:55:07,849
it's an idea would you be<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to</font>

1218
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:09,379
grab something I would be willing to

1219
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:10,880
contribute I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I would be</font>

1220
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:13,369
the best owner I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> find a knock</font>

1221
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,900
manager for that but I control around

1222
00:55:13,369 --> 00:55:17,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">for some of those poor or make an</font>

1223
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,950
introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the solicitor or an</font>

1224
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,940
individual ya know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can I can dig</font>

1225
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:21,410
around trying to find somebody it would

1226
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,390
be a good owner and so one thing we

1227
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:25,129
didn't cover with the draft process as

1228
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:26,420
we kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of breezed over it we could talk</font>

1229
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">about in the land a little bit was you</font>

1230
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,690
know there's kind of two pieces of these

1231
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:30,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents one is the the subject matter</font>

1232
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:32,690
experts that are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing the bulk</font>

1233
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:34,250
of the writing and the editing and

1234
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:35,839
watching and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> role</font>

1235
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,579
of shepherd and so most of these

1236
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,349
documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have a shepherd or all of</font>

1237
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:41,540
them should end up with a shepherd they

1238
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:43,670
can help find the smees and pull<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1239
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:45,050
together and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the document</font>

1240
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,690
makes it through and shear them when

1241
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:55,480
it's time exactly and Greg<font color="#CCCCCC"> dandy with</font>

1242
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">Equinix thanks Craig</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> luli equinix</font>

1243
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,590
so we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on documents that would</font>

1244
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:05,050
help you guys run your own networks well

1245
00:56:01,590 --> 00:56:07,570
is it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope to have documents to help</font>

1246
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:10,270
your own customers run a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little better</font>

1247
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:13,150
for instance maybe something a basic guy

1248
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:18,640
just configure<font color="#E5E5E5"> a BGP somebody that's</font>

1249
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:22,210
coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-homing anything like</font>

1250
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:24,368
that because everybody eventually<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

1251
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:27,040
boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked them to write their own BGP</font>

1252
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:29,350
guide for their own customers of course

1253
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,050
you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own reference for</font>

1254
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:35,380
whatever communities you support how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1255
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:37,240
adjust for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those but just basic BGP</font>

1256
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,650
instead of pointing them at a book a

1257
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,790
huge book and they're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1258
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:41,790
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> within two weeks</font>

1259
00:56:52,640 --> 00:57:00,859
I think it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good point even just</font>

1260
00:56:59,869 --> 00:57:02,269
a little broader is that you know this

1261
00:57:00,859 --> 00:57:04,098
isn't just for service riders right it's

1262
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:05,959
for network operators which could be you

1263
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:07,069
know a really small office it could be

1264
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,539
bigger and some things like there's

1265

1267
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,529
there's something like like the carrier

large ISPs but there's other ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1271
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,309
could be specific for smaller companies

1272
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:28,279
and there could be ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are just</font>

1305
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:58,980
is back my days when I was at the eff

1306
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,809
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure if it's gonna be applicable</font>

templates of best practices for dealing

00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:08,848
<font color="#E5E5E5">with law enforcement so I'm not sure if</font>

1310
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:11,308
<font color="#CCCCCC">that would be something you'd be</font>

1311
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:15,720
interested in in dumping into this pile

1312
00:59:11,309 --> 00:59:17,579
as well this is like generic<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1313
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:20,790
this is like how to deal with subpoenas

1314
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:22,349
and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> instance not accepting faxes and</font>

1315
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:25,410
things like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> all that sort of</font>

1316
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:27,690
stuff so I have those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can just start</font>

1317
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:31,910
throwing those in right now actually be

1318
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:31,910
fantastic thanks Tim

1319
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:40,000
so I'm wondering how conflict is going

1320
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:43,290
to be dealt with because there are some

1321
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,760
issues with v6 we all know we have

1322
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:48,190
multihoming is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement as some</font>

1323
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:51,730
networks and then we have Aaron policy

1324
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:54,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">people pushing for only permitting a /</font>

1325
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:57,600
32 from a provider to only allow that

1326
00:59:54,430 --> 01:00:01,540
one you know announcement which flat-out

1327
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,460
screws up you know multi hell me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1328
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:05,380
know everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the solution of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

1329
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:07,690
go get<font color="#CCCCCC"> P I for them I'm telling you not</font>

1330
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,820
every<font color="#E5E5E5"> network customer is going to want</font>

1331
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:10,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">to do that so there's going to be issues</font>

1332
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:12,100
and so then you're going to have a

1333
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:13,750
operators on were like screw it I'm

1334
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:16,810
letting you know if it's this subnet

1335
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:18,880
sighs I'm letting it through so how is

1336
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:20,650
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be d conflicted because we</font>

1337
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,040
actually really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1338
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:26,410
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and i'm i'm planning on two</font>

1339
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:31,750
different areas of a network right now

1340
01:00:26,410 --> 01:00:35,140
and I I have requirements that Aaron

1341
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:38,890
policy doesn't meet but as a provider we

1342
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:40,299
need to do it so how are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to I</font>

1343
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:42,370
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I should go to Erin right</font>

1344
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:44,110
now and proposed yet another pub<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

1345
01:00:42,370 --> 01:00:46,180
what I find ass tonight I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I</font>

1346
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:49,360
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to Aaron and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> propose a policy</font>

1347
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:51,730
to unscrew things and I shouldn't have

1348
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:53,320
to do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a part of the original</font>

1349
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:55,270
conversation and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

1350
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:57,220
thursday right is because there's a

1351
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:58,870
significant gap between policy and

1352
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:00,220
operational practice so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't mind</font>

1353
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,630
me bringing it back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the original</font>

1354
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:04,660
reason why we all gathered at that

1355
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:06,040
dinner yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to let that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go</font>

1356
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:07,839
and I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it go because now it's</font>

1357
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually kicking me in the face yeah as</font>

1358
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,740
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plan what subnet sighs I'm</font>

1359
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:13,180
going to end oh by the way this sudden

1360
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:16,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">that has to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> completely segregated</font>

1361
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:19,120
from this subnet because we have mental

1362
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:22,600
issues or there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are certain factors that</font>

1363
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:24,430
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to acknowledge but there's kind</font>

1364
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:28,180
of been this blind sided thing going on

1365
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:30,910
with Aaron policy and when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1366
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:34,000
the day I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work so how are</font>

1367
01:01:30,910 --> 01:01:36,460
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to deal with that so just to</font>

1368
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,550
for the clarity of the room that do not

1369
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:41,440
participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our registrar processes</font>

1370
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:44,470
or heron processes

1371
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:48,160
the real core of the issue is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not enough</font>

1372
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:49,598
operators attend<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meetings so you get</font>

1373
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,379
his policies get passed without

1374
01:01:49,599 --> 01:02:00,790
understanding operational impact yeah

1375
01:01:53,380 --> 01:02:03,010
good so Jason chiller google so the

1376
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:05,140
reason why I got involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

1377
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:07,990
initially is because there were a number

1378
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:09,790
of policies going through Aaron and I

1379
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,799
would jump up and say let's look at what

1380
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:14,470
the operational impacts of such a policy

1381
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:15,760
are what is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> due to routing what is</font>

1382
01:02:14,470 --> 01:02:17,859
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> due to multihoming what does this</font>

1383
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,770
do to our routing table size and and

1384
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:23,020
various operational concerns and the

1385
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:25,420
people in the room said Aaron does not

1386
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:28,150
set routing policy Aaron is not

1387
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:30,460
concerned with routing policy and john

1388
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:32,260
curran would always ask the question you

1389
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:35,079
know we can change the scope of the air

1390
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:38,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">and community do we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be concerned</font>

1391
01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:41,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the implications it for operators</font>

1392
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:46,000
in the routing space and the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

1393
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:48,848
the community continues to be no so

1394
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:51,579
where do we talk about routing policy if

1395
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:55,750
we don't do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Aaron and there's not</font>

1396
01:02:51,579 --> 01:02:57,760
a forum to do it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> nanog and the IETF</font>

1397
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:59,560

mean you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the operational</font>

operational impact of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Aaron policies is</font>

1407
01:03:22,630 --> 01:03:28,569
that seriously I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean if you go through</font>

1408
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:31,000
the NR p.m. and actually say or the and

1409
01:03:28,569 --> 01:03:32,829
say this policy affects this in this

1410
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,270
particular way is that something that

1411
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:37,200
you could then take back to Aaron and

1412
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:39,220
say now we have operational input on

1413
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,230
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're writing the</font>

1414
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:43,359
policies for that particular purpose

1415
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:44,829
this is what the community sees as the

1416
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,100
operational impact of what you guys are

1417
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:47,350
doing

1418
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:50,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think it would be good if we had this</font>

1419
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:52,839
community put that together which jason

1420
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:55,450
and i both are invested in it and we

1421
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:58,000
both have you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this much time but if</font>

1422
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:59,859
we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have you know agreement in this</font>

1423
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,990
group setting that yes this is something

1424
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:04,330
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do and i'd be willing to even</font>

1425
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:07,750
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know usher it through with</font>

1426
01:04:04,330 --> 01:04:10,090
Aaron stuff but standing up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with him at</font>

1427
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:12,730
one point me at another it's kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1428
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:14,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">like one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> person in a big crowd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

1429
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:16,450
just doesn't it hasn't gone anywhere so

1430
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:19,300
we need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> support of a collective</font>

1431
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:21,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">group and yeah I've actually gone</font>

1432
01:04:19,300 --> 01:04:24,520
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> n</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rpm already and i pulled out</font>

1433
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:26,710
things where I I can pointin I already

1434
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:30,270
have them written down there it totally

1435
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:33,270
screws several factors for routing and

1436
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:46,930
yeah they aren't concerned about routing

1437
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:48,370
but the policies affect them so so I

1438
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:51,580
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually address Marla's</font>

1439
01:04:48,370 --> 01:04:53,859
direct question which<font color="#CCCCCC"> was what do we do</font>

1440
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:56,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">about contentious issues like v6</font>

1441
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:58,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming and I think the answer is a</font>

1442
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:01,210
little bit complicated I think to the

1443
01:04:58,780 --> 01:05:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">extent that this community can agree</font>

1444
01:05:01,210 --> 01:05:05,470
that there's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> best common practice</font>

1445
01:05:02,890 --> 01:05:08,020
then we stopped absolutely document that

1446
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:10,089
and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then we should</font>

1447
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:11,890
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to the Aaron community and try</font>

1448
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,770
and drive policy that supports what

1449
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:16,480
operators are doing in the event that we

1450
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:17,950
can't find agreement because we've got

1451
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,840
people standing on both sides<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1452
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:21,910
spectrum arguing the heart out saying

1453
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:24,640
that it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> X or Y and those are</font>

1454
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:26,259
both mutually exclusive then I think the

1455
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,620
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can dock we can do is</font>

1456
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:31,630
document those two stances and do a kind

1457
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:33,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">of pros and cons approach and at least</font>

1458
01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:35,920
that way when other people enter into

1459
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,540
this sort of a discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> or when other</font>

1460
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,950
people are faced with trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the</font>

1461
01:05:37,540 --> 01:05:41,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">decision of should they configure their</font>

1462
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:43,540
network to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be behave more like X or Y</font>

1463
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:45,100
side of the spectrum that they at least

1464
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what the arguments are and what the</font>

1465
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:48,690
trade-offs are and what the pros<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1466
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">cons are</font>

1467
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:55,129
sean is irre is there a feedback

1477
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:24,860
and meeting on PP ml by you guys talking

1479
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:31,370
in the hallway I don't care but we need

1480
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:35,180
input and we get some input we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get</font>

1481
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:39,230
enough from operators it doesn't really

1482
01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:41,750
matter whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are making changes to</font>

1483
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:43,370
Aaron policy because of routing impact

1484
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:44,930
or not if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's something that the</font>

1485
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:46,339
community wants to do it should be

1486
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:48,589
suggested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the community will discuss</font>

1487
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:49,970
it and I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you read PP ml</font>

1488
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:52,430
but people are not afraid<font color="#E5E5E5"> to discuss</font>

1489
01:06:49,970 --> 01:06:57,350
whether it has routing impact or not so

1490
01:06:52,430 --> 01:06:59,029
let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the bc co p thing for anything</font>

1491
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:02,960
that's applicable there whenever there's

1492
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:05,330
interactions with Aaron policy somebody

1493
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,910
say something and we'll make sure that

1494
01:07:05,330 --> 01:07:10,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have the opportunity to get that</font>

1495
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:11,660
into the process and then we can

1496
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:13,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">highlight on the BTOP list when there's</font>

1497
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:15,290
discussions on PP ml that are relevant I

1498
01:07:13,760 --> 01:07:17,690
mean we can do that court sort of

1499
01:07:15,290 --> 01:07:21,759
coordination and we just need the<font color="#E5E5E5"> input</font>

1500
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:25,600
so please say something thank you Scott

1501
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,600
and thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all Pacey</font>

1502
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:40,479
kobe's okay anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else up in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mic one</font>

1503
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,999
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to add to this by the way</font>

1504
01:07:40,479 --> 01:07:44,999
having written one now my definitions

1505
01:07:45,959 --> 01:07:56,499
definitions so we had some other

1506
01:07:52,259 --> 01:08:00,339
housekeeping related stuff so a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

1507
01:07:56,499 --> 01:08:02,529
less meat but one of the points that was

1508
01:08:00,339 --> 01:08:06,269
brought up was it probably needs some

1509
01:08:02,529 --> 01:08:08,920
flavor of organizational bylaws written

1510
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:10,718
and I guess I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it to the room</font>

1511
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,279
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say does anybody have any particular</font>

1512
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:15,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggestions for how it should be</font>

1513
01:08:12,279 --> 01:08:19,770
structured or should we just take a stab

1514
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:19,770
at it and send something off to the list

1515
01:08:20,250 --> 01:08:25,689
yeah well you know something right

1516
01:08:23,729 --> 01:08:31,118
anybody have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> really strong opinions</font>

1517
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:37,899
one way or the other a half a page of

1518
01:08:31,118 --> 01:08:41,408
spaghetti noted<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay the other one that</font>

1519
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:42,729
was left on my list was was the name as

1520
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've list on vine</font>

1521
01:08:42,729 --> 01:08:47,618
con we have a website on<font color="#E5E5E5"> six connect org</font>

1522
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:50,078
we have mixed up we'd like to rename it

1523
01:08:47,618 --> 01:08:52,058
something more generic that is related

1524
01:08:50,078 --> 01:08:56,618
to best current operational practices<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1525
01:08:52,059 --> 01:09:00,069
forgot where your suggestion was ok so

1526
01:08:56,618 --> 01:09:06,639
the one that we have currently held as

1527
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:08,730
IP bcp<font color="#CCCCCC"> dcop org does anybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have any</font>

1528
01:09:06,639 --> 01:09:14,109
strong objections to renaming it so it's

1529
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:17,290
more focused on PCO<font color="#CCCCCC"> fee that is</font>

1530
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:23,139
excellent so while the contact

1531
01:09:17,290 --> 01:09:26,580
information does say fine calm and so on

1532
01:09:23,139 --> 01:09:29,460
if you subscribe<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it</font>

1533
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:31,170
hope you do don't don't worry i will i

1534
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:33,899
will make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list gets properly</font>

1535
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:37,350
moved and everybody that joins gets

1536
01:09:33,899 --> 01:09:39,990
copied an updated<font color="#E5E5E5"> on urls etc but would</font>
