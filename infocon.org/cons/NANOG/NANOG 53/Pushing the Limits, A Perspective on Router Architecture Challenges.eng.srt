1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,859
good morning ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> one my name is Greg</font>

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">Hankins I usually talk about 100 gig and</font>

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:07,830
today we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk so much</font>

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:08,879
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gig although i'll</font>

5
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,769
probably have to mention it a couple

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,019
times but they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk more</font>

7
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:15,179
about the the router architectures and

8
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,940
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're facing so at the june</font>

9
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,650
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i we did cover optical technology in</font>

10
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,210
quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of detail so stuff that's</font>

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:23,519
going on the wire do Perkins had a

12
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,010
really good talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about all the optical</font>

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,580
developments and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked quite a</font>

14
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,800
bit about 100<font color="#E5E5E5"> gig technology and first</font>

15
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,280
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> second generation things that we're</font>

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,140
doing we really haven't talked about

17
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,050
hardware architectures<font color="#CCCCCC"> in detail I think</font>

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,190
since<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably nanog 39 in Toronto we</font>

19
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,410
had a really good<font color="#CCCCCC"> boss and that was</font>

20
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,180
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inspiration for the title</font>

21
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,550
of my talk about pushing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIB limits</font>

22
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:49,680
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I turned it into a more generic talk</font>

23
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,699
about just pushing the limits and all

24
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,700
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to do</font>

25
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,849
interesting texture sorry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a</font>

26
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,020
ran across the screen so anyway in this

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,550
presentation we're going to talk about

28
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,860
all the things behind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet</font>

29
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,750
processing and this is a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a</font>

30
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,070
weird angle for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think but</font>

31
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,020
when i was<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking some of our ASIC</font>

32
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,309
engineers their comment was well we

33
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:13,229
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the line card from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

34
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,640
front we always look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the ports and we</font>

35
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really look at the back end and</font>

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,869
the stuff that we're doing in hardware

37
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:19,770
so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe be a weird angle but I think</font>

38
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,680
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of appropriate for this</font>

39
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,320
presentation so if we kind of look at

40
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,630
the challenges the basic challenge is

41
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,729
trying to boil it down into what we're

42
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,189
trying to do one axis we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

43
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">like look up capacity and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 14 capacity</font>

44
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:37,020
and this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing table and all</font>

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,060
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're trying to do in the a6</font>

46
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,280
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi-protocol forwarding we have</font>

47
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,950
growing Internet routing tables and VPN

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,110
tables we have the ipv4 d aggregation

49
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,939
and the ipv6 adoption so we're not

50
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,380
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to go on with</font>

51
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:52,020
the writing-table growth on the other

52
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,939
axis we have port density and the fact

53
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,429
that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do line r800 gig</font>

54
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,869
which is one packet every 6.2

55
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,380
nanoseconds that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to</font>

56
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:03,240
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up so if we put that all together</font>

57
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:05,880
we can't we can't do everything we can

58
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,190
go either very complex but that limits

59
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,750
our port density or we can do really

60
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">high port density but that limits the</font>

61
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,930
complexity so it's really a trade-off

62
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,640
between

63
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,500
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> components that we're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,629
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware with the available</font>

65
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology and then you know the risk is</font>

66
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,409
throwing in the kitchen sink and trying

67
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,219
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it too complex because that just</font>

68
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:27,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">just limits the density completely so if</font>

69
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:29,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">we look at a basic router forwarding</font>

70
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,530
architecture this is the way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

71
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,090
card is laid out but virtually every

72
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,829
router that I've looked at in the past

73
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has a very similar</font>

74
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:38,310
architecture some components may move

75
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,959
around you may have a psycho separate

76
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:42,540
map or a separate fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> combined some</font>

77
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,120
memories but basically there's a traffic

78
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,358
manager a network processor and some

79
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,319
memory components a system ram which is

80
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:51,510
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really the focus of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

81
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:54,780
presentation system<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rams just uses</font>

82
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,548
regular DRAM and there's not really any

83
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,290
any I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess pressing your new</font>

84
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:00,150
developments around system Ram system

85
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,629
Ram is growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we can put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot on</font>

86
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,489
the unless CPUs the memories that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

87
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:06,899
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the packet</font>

88
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,909
look up memories which is typically

89
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,269
built out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> T</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cam and some sort of</font>

90
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:14,219
other RAM and the packet buffer memories

91
00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:15,900
so for packet lookups we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do</font>

92
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:18,650
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least 100 million packets hundred</font>

93
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,060
fifty million packets per second lookups

94
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:23,489
hopefully more than one port on a card

95
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,919
and for packet buffer memory we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

96
00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,569
need at least 200<font color="#E5E5E5"> gigs of throughput in</font>

97
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">in and out of the memory so that's a</font>

98
00:03:27,569 --> 00:03:30,540
pretty high performance requirement and

99
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,760
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some chip two chip</font>

100
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,379
interfaces which are basically the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir</font>

101
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">DS links or some sort of other links</font>

102
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,739
which tie the components together and

103
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:42,418
those are and typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the range of</font>

104
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:46,379
3.125 up to 25 and 28 gig links<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming</font>

105
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:48,479
soon so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little bit about</font>

106
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,679
memory technology developments and

107
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,449
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going on there and then</font>

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,449
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk a little more about the ASIC</font>

109
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:56,519
technology the memory challenge really

110
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:59,400
is that packet rates have greatly

111
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,019
exceeded the memory read rates and for

112
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">euro for people that are really into the</font>

113
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,769
hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tr see the real cycle</font>

114
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,290
time so that's really the limiting

115
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,689
factor here we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have look</font>

116
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,569
up and buffer memories that have about a

117
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:14,099
one nanosecond random read rate and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

118
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,320
obviously for buffering we'd like to

119
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:19,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a nanosecond right rate we don't</font>

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that today dynamic Ram well it is</font>

121
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,170
dynamic and it is random access<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory</font>

122
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,479
doesn't actually mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

123
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,670
randomly access the memory at the same

124
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">time anywhere you want memory has these</font>

125
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,660
inherent constraints where you can read

126
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,980
or write something but then you

127
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,020
basically have to wait a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

128
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:37,430
time before you touch that same<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bank so</font>

129
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,229
that's called<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bank block and you can't</font>

130
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,060
read the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bank over and over again</font>

131
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,160
or write<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same Bank over and over</font>

132
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:45,620
again so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that really has some challenges</font>

133
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:48,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">in how how we have to lay out the RAM</font>

134
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,020
and since its inherent to ram technology

135
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,719
it applies both to on ship and off chip

136
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:56,419
solutions so just kind of to give you an

137
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:59,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea today's solutions that we have are</font>

138
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,820
dramatically slower than we would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

139
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">like so we have possibly around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 48</font>

140
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:07,070
nanoseconds for random access sort of

141
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,549
commodity Ram<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe around 20</font>

142
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,560
nanoseconds for specialized<font color="#E5E5E5"> off chip</font>

143
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,930
which would be rld<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM and then we can</font>

144
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,850
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into single-digit</font>

145
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:21,590
nanosecond random read rates if we put

146
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:23,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the memory</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on on the actual chip so</font>

147
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:25,219
really the requirements<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have for</font>

148
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">lookup and buffering memory are twofold</font>

149
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:30,170
fast and big<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want we would like</font>

150
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have those two things together so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

151
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,230
fast we actually have to store

152
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,299
everything that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look up for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

153
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,700
packet in hardware we want to do this at

154
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,280
line rate so I like I mentioned before

155
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">400 gig that's 150 million packets per</font>

156
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,390
second or about one packet every 6.2

157
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,070
nanoseconds we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

158
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,930
multiple ports and a network processor

159
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:50,810
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give us more reasonable density</font>

160
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:52,490
than just single 400 gig cards and in

161
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:55,640
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> we actually have to do multiple</font>

162
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,920
pack up lookups per packet so<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font>

163
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,560
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up in some cases possibly</font>

164
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,410
two or three things<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a packet which</font>

165
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,300
takes two or three cycles in terms of

166
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,430
big obviously we're putting more and

167
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,470
more stuff into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router so we have</font>

168
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,510
mac address tables which can now be a

169
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're sort of generally or two table</font>

170
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,770
then we have all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> VPN technologies</font>

171
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,450
we're putting on top of that vpls or PBB

172
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:20,770
or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we have the</font>

173
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:25,190
ipv4 fib v6 fit that's unicast multicast

174
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,840
VPN routes a CO SQ s policies and then

175
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,240
also we want to have obviously d

176
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,590
buffering because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need multiple</font>

177
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,840
hundreds of gigabytes of sustained

178
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,390
memory throughput if you look at a

179
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,929
gigabit of RAM or a gigabyte of RAM

180
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,000
that's only about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

181
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,440
seconds buffering at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get great</font>

182
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,240
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously have to have a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

183
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">on there and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd actually have</font>

184
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,380
like to have a thousands of thousands of

185
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">cues purport and do all sorts of queue</font>

186
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,159
management and hierarchical qos and

187
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,469
things like that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the buffer memory</font>

188
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,680
can get quite complicated so what we

189
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,259
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> need is a big fast elephant but</font>

190
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:02,430
unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> those those things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

191
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:05,039
exist so we kind of have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to build our</font>

192
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,560
own big fast element out of available

193
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,330
component technology so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we just look</font>

194
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,099
at the available memory that we have

195
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:13,530
there's really two kinds of memories

196
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,729
there is T cam which is a search memory

197
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:17,159
and then there's a bunch of different

198
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">kinds of RAM which is really storage or</font>

199
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,130
memory that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do searches</font>

200
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,660
on really fast so I don't want to redo

201
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:27,810
the whole table but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couple things that</font>

202
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,599
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out is that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> key</font>

203
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:33,060
cams that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have they give us fantastic</font>

204
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,740
access speeds unfortunately the the

205
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,810
density<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a little bit lower than we</font>

206
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:39,120
need and the cost per bit and power

207
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,280
consumption are much higher if we look

208
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,470
at technologies like static Ram it's

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,570
really really fast but unfortunately the

210
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:48,960
density isn't there and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cop</font>

211
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:51,000
cost per bit is significantly higher and

212
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,549
then some of the the DRAM technologies

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,460
DDR that's just your standard sort of

214
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:57,870
desktop computer memory it has really

215
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,948
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good density but unfortunately</font>

216
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">also has the highest latency so that</font>

217
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,550
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't work out either and we get</font>

218
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,699
into some more specialized memories like

219
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:11,130
rld<font color="#CCCCCC"> RAM and GD dr which is a graphics d</font>

220
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:13,440
rim and those have again you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

221
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">good high access speeds density is</font>

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,159
really good but<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately the leo it</font>

223
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,509
just doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in terms of some of</font>

224
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:25,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that we need because it is</font>

225
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:26,909
specialized memory so doesn't always

226
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,110
work out<font color="#E5E5E5"> just because it components</font>

227
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,849
available doesn't mean we can integrate

228
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,270
it and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more about</font>

229
00:08:29,849 --> 00:08:34,588
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in the next couple slides so we've</font>

230
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:36,718
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it all together there is</font>

231
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:38,779
basically a couple mechanisms to longest

232
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,969
prefix match<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your traditional</font>

233
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:43,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">cam cam technology and then some sort of</font>

234
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,320
combination of<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM technology in the way</font>

235
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,450
that a cam works is basically you ask it

236
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,110
an IP destination address hands you back

237
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:51,450
some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

238
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,029
index and next<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoc table and it's a very</font>

239
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:56,459
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> search the we like cams because</font>

240
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,649
the search latency is fixed the

241
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,140
throughput is pretty high you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have fixed</font>

242
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">and bounded add delete times the</font>

243
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,819
partitioning is very simple so if you

244
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,069
have a cam partition say that holds a

245
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,140
million v4 prefixes it will hold a

246
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:12,660
million v4 prefixes under all conditions

247
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:15,360
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have exact partitions in the</font>

248
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,130
cam for that capacity so the ordering

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layout is very simple to do you</font>

250
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:21,450
just order the data in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of longest</font>

251
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,820
mask and that's how<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lookup works</font>

252
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,350
when you have a ram base to architecture

253
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:28,079
what you're basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do is</font>

254
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,120
take an ordered data structure and do

255
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:31,410
and do a lookup on that data structure

256
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,260
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware you're just moving it from</font>

257
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,719
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> into hardware to make it faster</font>

258
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:38,760
so it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of properties that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

259
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,380
like but also some challenges one of the

260
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenges is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of</font>

261
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">different search algorithms to do treat</font>

262
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is nothing specific to</font>

263
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,820
hardware like I said we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just taking</font>

264
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,319
some sort of tree algorithm and making

265
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware sometimes as our</font>

266
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,089
patented but<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately each</font>

267
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,649
algorithm also has trade-offs so for

268
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:56,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">example one algorithm might use hashing</font>

269
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,100
and then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with that</font>

270
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:01,829
hashing and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually affects the</font>

271
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,199
capacity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the memory system so like I</font>

272
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:05,609
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> with cam it's very easy to say we</font>

273
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:07,890
can hold this much memory in our routing

274
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,140
table with a ram based system

275
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:12,000
unfortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's variable and we can</font>

276
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,890
talk about worst-case scenarios and we

277
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,260
can give upper and lower bounds but it's

278
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:22,050
hard to give you an exact capacity

279
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:23,640
number so in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of many architects</font>

280
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,140
are solutions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think this is kind of</font>

281
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,600
where the industry is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we</font>

282
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,430
use t cams for for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> long time we're</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to go dramatically faster</font>

284
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,599
i'm sorry but basically i think we're

285
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to see new architectures that</font>

combine these<font color="#CCCCCC"> s rams and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> d rams so that</font>

287
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,660
we can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large number of banks where</font>

288
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,250
we can do parallel searches and then

289
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,930
also not talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the next</font>

290
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,699
section<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think what we're going to see</font>

291
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,250
is people integrating packet look up

292
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:49,170
memories actually into the a6 so that'll

293
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,660
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a lot faster look up speeds</font>

294
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:52,829
remember if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> onship lookups we can</font>

295
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually get down into the single</font>

296
00:10:52,829 --> 00:10:57,390
nanosecond lookup ranges and the thing

297
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I also want remind people of is</font>

298
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,040
that we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have technology that</font>

299
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,529
will last us and be around for

300
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,050
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> five plus years the graphics</font>

301
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,939
technology in particular is moving so

302
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:10,130
quickly that we just can't put that

303
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff on a line card so if you go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into a</font>

00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">I go in there there's some new graphics</font>

technology or something like that right

308
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that moon industry is moving really</font>

309
00:11:19,009 --> 00:11:23,089
fast I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it if</font>

310
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:25,638

312
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:31,069
yeah i just don't think of the work so

313
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:32,690
in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of buffering it's it's a tough</font>

314
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:34,459
challenge to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much throughput in</font>

315
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,889
and out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of out of buffering memory I</font>

316
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:39,290
think the ddr4 speeds that are coming

317
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:41,630
will give<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a lot faster memory</font>

318
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:43,040
throughput but basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way that</font>

319
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:44,959
buffer management works is that there's

320
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,269
no algorithm out there like there is for

321
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,969
tree traversal it's a very specialized

322
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:52,430
in proprietary technology that vendors

323
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,440
used and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we might possibly see</font>

324
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,420
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving into its own custom asics so</font>

325
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:59,029
it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technically feasible to</font>

326
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:00,259
actually just design a custom buffer

327
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:04,339

328
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:06,019
than commodity drm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay ASIC technology</font>

329
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:08,060
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really the challenge is we're</font>

330
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:09,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to do a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of lookups on a</font>

331
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,209
packet it's really complex and we have

332
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,440
to actually look pretty deep into a

333
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,819
packet if you look at all the things

334
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to do with layer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 2</font>

338
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:28,040
specialized packet header we have to be

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look up all that stuff at line</font>

340
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,170
rate leg load balancing in particular is

341
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:35,750
very complex and means we have to look

342
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,120
really far into the packet possibly into

343
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:40,069
VPN headers and and pass multiple labels

344
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,470
and things like that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

345
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:45,800
things like OEM hardware time stamping

346
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,240
now to give you accurate counters we

347
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,910
also want to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ton of Statistics</font>

348
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,040
counters so virtual interfaces and also

349
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:54,079
aggregate VLAN counters in particular or

350
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,430
a tough challenge to implement in

351
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,258
hardware and basically like I mentioned

352
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">before it's all the integration so the</font>

353
00:12:57,259 --> 00:13:00,550
more stuff we can put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a chip the</font>

354
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:03,380
more scalable we can make the system

355
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,269
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple limitations we can</font>

356
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,040
basically use a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips in parallel</font>

357
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:08,899
but that means higher costs much higher

358
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,930
power higher heat dissipation and

359
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,940
overall lower empty

360
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,560
bf2 the system so we're looking at

361
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,410
next-generation technology that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll show you the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide basically</font>

363
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,079
we're moving to 45 and 32 nanometer

364
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:25,390
process technology counting on 22 which

365
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,279
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming up to be technically feasible</font>

366
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,600
and then we also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to talk about the</font>

367
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,060
chip interconnects because we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

368
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,740
limited a little bit in the component

369
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,390
interfaces that we have and then just to

370
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,730
give you an example on our hunter gig

371
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,310
card we actually use over 100 integrated

372
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,380
circuits so that's just a ton of circus

373
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,640
to manage and a ton of components to

374
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,820
manage and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce those</font>

375
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,860
components so we look at where process

376
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:49,540
geometries are going fortunately we're

377
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:51,670
still following<font color="#E5E5E5"> Moore's law and I think</font>

378
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:54,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">some of the projections I saw think that</font>

379
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:56,380
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still meet that well past 2015 so</font>

380
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,959
we don't see any sign of Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Law</font>

381
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,390
being wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime soon and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

382
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">what that allows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is continually</font>

383
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,740
increase the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> transistors</font>

384
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,200
and awesome number of gates that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

385
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,550
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the ASIC so the the transistors</font>

386
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,320
are basically the building blocks<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

387
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:13,479
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> use to meet to make gates so the more</font>

388
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,010
transistors we can put into an ASIC the

389
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,410
more gates we get and the more logic

390
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,970
would get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it and unfortunately</font>

391
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:20,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's kind of a every vendor has their</font>

392
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,450
own capacities so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you an</font>

393
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,910
example from some of our a<font color="#CCCCCC"> six</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

394
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,410
we can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually tell you what the ASIC</font>

395
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,660
vendor capacities are without them

396
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,920
getting somewhat upset of us but

397
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:32,260
basically you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font>

398
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,910
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming up on chips that approach 5</font>

399
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,580
billion transistors and fifty million

400
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:38,860
gates so that's a that's pretty exciting

401
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,529
in terms of what we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual</font>

402
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:43,150
ASIC and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cig</font>

403
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:45,760
technology evolution this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is really cool</font>

404
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:47,650
so what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing basically is a six</font>

405
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are traditionally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a 2d package so</font>

406
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:52,180
you have one really<font color="#E5E5E5"> big ASIC on a really</font>

407
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:54,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">big chip and that's that's your</font>

408
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,370
component where we're going is actually

409
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:59,230
what's called a silicon interposer which

410
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:01,480
connects multiple chips on the same

411
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:03,670
package and then eventually will

412
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,620
actually go to 3d packaging and 3d

413
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,620
packaging i think is ultimately very

414
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:10,420
cool and will<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow us to do the most</font>

415
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:14,200
things because it really just combines

416
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:16,479
to a 6 into<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actual package so in</font>

417
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,399
terms of advantage the advantage really

418
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,329
is that we have much shorter

419
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,520
interconnects remember we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get to</font>

420
00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:23,630
that one nanosecond or single-digit

421
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:24,949
nanosecond latency for memory

422
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:26,960
these packages will actually give us

423
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:29,510
that because we can put memories and

424
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,540
packet processing saving technologies on

425
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:34,040
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> acing one real quick question</font>

426
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,410
would you see the pit line card pitch

427
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,480
for the 3d packaging that's a really

428
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,010
good question and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very ASIC</font>

429
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,320
specific question that I really don't

430
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">know the answer to so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know all</font>

431
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,910
about the pitch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and balls and stuff</font>

432
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:48,350
like that I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to give</font>

433
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,770
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> an overview where the technology is</font>

434
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:53,810
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other advantage is that it</font>

435
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,720
gives<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a lot lower power consumption</font>

436
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:58,369
although it does have a lot more heat

437
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,870
and signal density in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same place</font>

438
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,490
right obviously we're taking a bunch of

439
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,110
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> asics putting them in the same</font>

440
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:05,270
place so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have a lot</font>

441
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,610
higher heat in that<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that same place</font>

442
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,260
and this is a picture from an IBM 3d

443
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,930
package it just looks like a regular a

444
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:13,280
60 there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing special really in</font>

445
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:17,120
terms of the ASIC that we have to do

446
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,890
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a 2d 3d ASIC okay</font>

447
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,030
chip interconnect<font color="#E5E5E5"> signaling I showed</font>

448
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,189
this slide when I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

449
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,930
hundred gig last time but<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font>

450
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:27,200
need faster component signaling

451
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:29,359
technology in between the a6 and as far

452
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,500
as integration this is a challenge

453
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,330
because if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at current</font>

454
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,000
technologies you have them either

455
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,320
optimized for ASIC technology so logic

456
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,570
ribbon for things like network

457
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,150
processors or memory technologies are

458
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,700
obviously optimized for memory so we

459
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do the same thing in the</font>

460
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,060
same ASIC we can't I'm sorry we can't do

461
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,430
two different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things in the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> async</font>

462
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,410
we can't do memory and logic in the same

463
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:53,630
ASIC because the ASIC isn't optimized

464
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,670
for both of those at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same time so</font>

465
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,470
the 3d chips will actually allow us to

466
00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:01,760
do both of those things in the same

467
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">package then you may ask well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so you</font>

468
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,359
know you said the 22 nanometer

469
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,709
technology was available in 2011 why

470
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,780
aren't we using that well you have to

471
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:10,610
also look at the way that ASIC

472
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,010
technology works basically vendors make

473
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:14,899
the transistor density their focus first

474
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:16,939
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest of the what's called</font>

475
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">the logic libraries develop afterwards</font>

476
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,449
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to be able to have</font>

477
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,089
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those components in order for us to</font>

478
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:26,240
put<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff on the board and they do be</font>

479
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:28,069
able to integrate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok technology</font>

480
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,710
integration this is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of an</font>

481
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:32,870
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> to show you how challenging it</font>

482
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:35,000
is to put all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a board this</font>

483
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,500
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of our current generation</font>

484
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,770

485
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,840
of

486
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:40,040
asic density<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just no room on</font>

487
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,800
there and in fact our next generation

488
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,300
card is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a motherboard and</font>

489
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:47,330
then a<font color="#CCCCCC"> full length</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> daughter board that</font>

490
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:48,560
just covers<font color="#CCCCCC"> the whole card so we're</font>

491
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:50,899
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put more and more stuff on</font>

492
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,040
there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I mentioned the 3d ASIC</font>

493
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,830
technology will give us a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

494
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:57,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">options in terms of better</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> board real</font>

less power consumption and things like

497
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:05,900
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok summary ok we're doing well so</font>

500
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,840
said before Moore's<font color="#CCCCCC"> Law still is holding</font>

501
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,700
true so we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a couple more</font>

502
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,560
years at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least on that there's a couple</font>

503
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">different software fig aggregation</font>

504
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:20,389
technologies that have been proposed

505
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:21,980
there's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting paper that</font>

506
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">I encourage you to go read this</font>

507
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:25,850
basically talks about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok let's take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

508
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:27,620
whole fib and then optimize it and only

509
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,719
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the stuff that we need into the</font>

510
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,370
actual hardware and then there's what's

511
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,800
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple virtual aggregation which</font>

512
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:36,320
is a much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> simpler approach with</font>

513
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:38,600
basis just<font color="#E5E5E5"> says put a default route in</font>

514
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,159
the hardware<font color="#E5E5E5"> and maybe a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of other</font>

515
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,080
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need so it's a much</font>

516
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,550
simpler algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenFlow a</font>

517
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,560
software-defined networking or

518
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,780
programmatic networking that's a whole

519
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">nother topic and possibly can of worms</font>

520
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,280
and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> also have some tunneling</font>

521
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:54,560
mechanisms like Lisp which has been

522
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,670
proposed but as far as i know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> turn</font>

523
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">into more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a data center technology</font>

524
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:01,370
than really a fib scaling technology so

525
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok in summary we really would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

526
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,530
give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you cards that you can use for at</font>

527
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,880
least seven plus years we want to do

528
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,010
multi-protocol forwarding<font color="#E5E5E5"> high density</font>

530
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:13,820
to have a scalable and a flexible fit

531
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:15,919
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global routing table and a</font>

532
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,830
lot of VPN routes it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough balance</font>

533
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:19,820
because we have to make trade-offs and

534
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:22,129
you know technology capabilities

535
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,439
dictates what we can do with the

536
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,030
functionality in the port density and

537
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,770
eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would have a bunch of</font>

538
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,200
things that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> will allow us to do</font>

539
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,120
higher capacity and will allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to</font>

540
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,710
scale in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future so we have a multi</font>

gig multi-hundred gig packet processing

542
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:38,630
asics and then custom look up and custom

543
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,149
member buffering memory solutions and

544
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,920
then the cool 3d ASIC technology that I

545
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:46,750
talked about will allow us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do all</font>

546
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,750
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same package</font>

547
00:19:50,129 --> 00:19:56,049
okay thanks Greg thanks for that

548
00:19:53,859 --> 00:20:02,379
questions let's take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

549
00:19:56,049 --> 00:20:04,269
and then we'll get to the break going

550
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:13,269
come on i know somebody has some

551
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:15,789
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions the one time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm talking and</font>

552
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:18,539
like not asking hard questions on the

00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:20,799
Wi-Fi is being investigated right now

554
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:23,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">nobody simplest should provide some</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">additional detail though sorry but we're</font>

556
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:29,019
trying to fix it thank you hey that

557
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:34,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">wasn't that wasn't a question man come</font>

558
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:37,349
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess it's break time</font>
